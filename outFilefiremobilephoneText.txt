I wanted to love my Fire Phone.  I really love Amazon and my kindle software, and they made it a bargain.  Who could resist a year of prime on top of the rest?  When at last it arrived, that sleek black box was a pleasure to unwrap.<br/><br/>The phone felt good in my hand, sturdy, well made.  I used it as a phone -- wow, good sound, much better than many of the cell phones I've used in the past.  Score.<br/><br/>I played with the dynamic perspective -- how nifty.  I tried changing the backgound and here was my first disapointment --  a lot of them are dim, even bordering on creepy.  Clearly time and effort was spent on choosing them, but they felt like Uncle Fester's last minute IT assignment.  I finally chose one that bugged me the least.  As my 9 year old said the first time he saw one, "Cool!" and then the next day, "that gets kind of annoying."<br/><br/>I moved forward, and loaded my email app, gmail, without a problem.  I thought "Smartphones are pretty useful!" and felt reassured in my decision.<br/><br/>Then I started looking for  other apps I've used on my android tablet, and I came up empty on the Amazon app store.  Huh.  I thought "no big deal, I can live without that app" and I searched for something else and thought "and that app too." Finally I realized a lot of google apps were off limits, and I had to rethink what I could do.  It felt like a big step backward.<br/><br/>I found solace in streaming a song from my Amazon Music and opening up my current book using the kindle software.  Better. Yes, reading was lovely.  I took a picture and identified something instantly with Firefly -- nothing tricky, but it was fast.  That was kind of fun.  I never plan on using my phone to buy anything, however, so not that much fun.<br/><br/>I used the apps i was able to install, and I found myself befuddled a number of times.  There's no software back button support.  Some apps have a working back button within them, but not all, and there were times I felt trapped in whatever I was using, like Gretel after the breadcrumbs were eaten.<br/><br/>Swiping was supposed to help, as was flicking your wrist, but the responses were inconsistent.  I thought I was fumbly and inept until I shared my phone with an IT pro and he also found that there were times where he'd flick his wrist 3 or 4 times without success.  You'd feel so frustrated you'd want to start shaking it uncontrollably, then fling it into the wall.  I loved catching him in those moments, our frustration shared.  Navigation that was effortless on an android tablet became convoluted and difficult.  MANY things that felt effortless on a full blown android were obscured or disabled.<br/><br/>A phrase swirled in my head, "you can't get there from here."<br/><br/>The low point came when I was showing off my new phone at work to extol the virtues of my new Amazon Fire.  Flick fail.  Swipe fail. Firefly fail.  I could at least show the dynamic perspective with my lock screen, and they gazed politely. They tried the swipes and flicks, and sometimes they worked.  Overall though,  I think I solidified their loyalty to their current iPhone or Android.  Sigh.<br/><br/>I had my Fire Phone two more demoralizing days, and gave up.  What I thought at first was unhappiness due to unrealistic expections of having a smartphone, I came to realize was unhappiness based upon the comparison of my phone to my android tablet.  It's just not as good.  The Fire Phone is pretty and well made, but the software is crippled and the experience disappointing.<br/><br/>I returned the phone, and I have to say Amazon was professional, quick and courteous. Customer service rates an A+.<br/><br/>I replaced my Fire Phone with a Google Nexus 5, and I could not be more happy.  Sorry Amazon, I wanted to love you best.  Your screen was great and I loved using you for calls, but my need for sleek functionality won out over the fun of drama and glitz. Maybe next time.
I had a hard decision between the Amazon Fire Phone, Samsung Galaxy S 5, and Samsung Galaxy S 5 Active. I eventually picked the Fire Phone because I have loved my Kindle, Amazon Prime, and the camera on it was excellent. I keep my phones for a while, in all my years of wireless service I have been off contract more than I have been in one. This phone replaced a 1st gen windows phone I carried for 5 years or so (which still works flawlessly after years of abuse).<br/>First week I was disappointed in how the battery will not last even 16 hours if you do anything that takes advantage of the high def screen. I now have a charger in the car, at work and at home so the damn thing can be plugged in all the time. I am essentially back to having a corded phone that travels.<br/>I also noticed was it gets super warm, I understand that having a powerful processor will generate heat, but with my job being in technology I also know poor cooling design and excessive heat is the bane of electronics.<br/>The most annoying issue I have found is that the day after my 2 weeks trial period ended the key pad has started to freeze up and disappear at least once a day, forcing a restart of the phone.<br/>Conclusions: Gimmicky at best, has potential if people actually program to the capabilities of the phone, good call quality, excellent camera, Amazon's restricted access to apps has been more annoying than I anticipated, I am nervous about the phone's longevity and hope it makes it past my 2 years on contract without too many issues until I can get it replaced, I feel like I should have went with the Samsung Galaxy S 5 Active.<br/><br/>Update: My opinions have not changed about the phone. I was contacted by Amazon's customer service and they were excellent and did all they could do for a customer. I would rate the customer service at Amazon as one of the best in the world.<br/><br/>Paying $199 for the phone on contract to have it change to $0.99 just one month later feels like a huge rip and is a bit insulting as a customer. The new 99 cent phones even come with Prime. I will never again buy a phone on release week. Thank you Amazon for a hard earned lesson.
Pros-<br/><br/>1. Nice comfortable build.<br/>2. Good camera.<br/>3. Excellent 24/7 customer service.<br/>4. Dynamic Perspective is fun and unique.<br/>5. Pretty nice headphones are included.<br/>6. One year of Free Amazon Prime.<br/><br/>Cons-<br/><br/>1. Missing Google apps.<br/>2. Gestures and navigation is overcomplicated.<br/>3. Mediocre battery life.<br/>4. Bad value for your money.<br/><br/>Over the last couple of days I have managed to get my hands on the much anticipated Amazon Fire phone. I had being waiting with anticipation for this phone for the last few months and was very excited when it was finally announced. My initial impression has a being a mixed bag. While I commend Amazon for trying to create a unique experience and bringing new features like Dynamic Perspective, I simply can't ignore the shortcomings of this phone and the many improvements it needs. I will elaborate more below.<br/><br/>DESIGN<br/><br/>The phone has a 4.7 inch display and weights 160 grams. Not the lightest phone in the market but I personally don't mind. It feels solid in the hand. The phone is comfortable to hold making it an excellent one handed device. The size of the phone is a very good compromise between smaller phones like the IPhone 5S and bigger android phone like the G3, HTC One, and Galaxy S5.<br/><br/>The front and back of the phone are made of Gorilla Glass 3. It reminds me a lot of the IPhone 4S and the Nexus 4. The glass on the back is very prone to fingerprints. If the IPhone 4S is any indications this phone is going to have durability problems. That glass back is going to inevitably break when you drop the phone a couple of times. Keep this in mind. A case is a must for this phone. The border around the phone is made of rubber. It makes for an excellent grip when making calls. It will come in handy if you are one of those people that tend to drop your phone a lot.<br/><br/>The phone features several hardware buttons around the device. On the left hand side you have a dedicated "Firefly" button (more on that later) along with the volume up and down keys.  On the top you have the power button and the 3.5 mm jack for headphones. You also have a single physical home button on the front of the phone similar to the one found on the Galaxy S5 and the IPhone 5S. The front look of the device is unique because it has 5 front facing cameras. One of them is the regular front facing camera to take selfies and the other four is for the "Dynamic Perspective" 3D effects (more on that coming up). I don't particularly like the front view but I got used to it and have learned to ignore the camera holes.<br/><br/>The phone has a unibody design. Meaning that the back cover is not removable and neither is the battery. It also lacks any slot to use MicroSD cards. The phone is not waterproof either. I would have liked if Amazon would have added a fingerprint scanner on the physical home button of the device. This phone is made primarily to have a convenient way to purchase items on Amazon. It would have been nice to have a fingerprint scanner that would authorize you to make purchases without having to put a password or pin. Not to mention it provides better security than a regular pin or password.<br/><br/>Overall, the design of the phone is nice but there is definitely room for improvement in future versions.<br/><br/>DISPLAY<br/><br/>The phone has a 4.7 inch display that has a resolution of 1280 x 720. That is a step below most high end smartphone. It is not terrible by any means. In fact, I got done reviewing the LG G3 a few days ago and in terms of actual usage the difference in resolution is negligible. The difference is much bigger on paper than in real life usage. From a normal viewing distance you can barely tell any difference. The screen color saturation is pretty nice.<br/><br/>One of the things that I like about the phone is the screen brightness. Outdoor visibility is excellent. It is easily one of the brightest smartphones on the market. If you find yourself having a hard time reading and viewing videos outdoors you are going to appreciate this. When indoors I used the phone at around 40% percent brightness and it was more than enough.<br/><br/>PERFORMANCE<br/><br/>The Fire phone comes with a very powerful processor. It is the Snapdragon 800 clocked in at 2.2 GHz. It also has 2 GB of ram memory. Most of the high end phones released this year have come with the newer Snapdragon 801 which is slightly faster than the one found on the Amazon Fire phone. The Fire phone manages to hold its own though. The interface performed relatively smooth and I did not experienced much lag. You will not have any problem performing everyday tasks like phone calls, text messages, Facebook, Twitter etc.<br/>The only time where I experienced a bit of lag and stuttering was when I was playing 3D games that used Dynamic Perspective. They should have gone with the latest processor. Those 3D effects seem to take a lot of processing power. I hope some of these stutters are software bugs that can be improved later on. More often than not the phone felt quick and responsive. I am not going to argue too much about its performance. For general usage it is more than enough but I am a bit concerned on how it will perform over the 2 year contract lifetime.<br/><br/>USER INTERFACE, DYNAMIC PERSPECTIVE AND FIREFLY<br/><br/>The Amazon Fire phone is an Android phone. It doesn't look like any phone you have used in the past though. That is because it comes with a skin on top of android known as Fire OS. It looks very similar to the one found on the Amazon Kindle Fire tablet. Instead of the regular row of icons and widgets you find on other android smartphones you will see a carousel that scrolls around on your home screen. The carousel shows all of the apps and videos you have used in the past. It shows them in chronological order. The ones you have used more recently appears first. It is very useful when you are trying to switch between recently used applications. Below the carousel you see recommendations and notifications.<br/><br/>Remember those four cameras on the front of the device that I talked about earlier? Well the purpose of those is to track your head movements. When you are navigating through apps on any regular phone you will find that you have tabs on the sides of the apps that will open menus and other options if you swipe from the sides. Well on this phone you can do that with a flick of your wrist. Depending on whether you tilt your phone to the left or the right it will show you different menus and additional information. It is useful if you are like using the phone one handed. These gestures are optional though and you can simply use the regular swiping from the sides if you prefer. The gestures are found on some of the apps but not all of them. It will probably be integrated in more apps in the future.<br/><br/>Besides tracking your movements the cameras on the front provide what Amazon calls Dynamic Perspective. This adds a 3D effect to the lock screen of the phone as well as games found on the Amazon store. The 3D effect is very impressive. Much better than the one found on the Nintendo 3DS. Amazon included its very own map application that takes advantage of this feature. When you look at the landscape of the map you can clearly see the top of the buildings in 3D. When you tilt the phone to you left you get more information on the map. The games I played that took advantage of Dynamic Perspective were pretty fun. I hope other developers jump into the bandwagon and created more custom applications for this phone. In my time using the phone I did not experience any nausea or eye fatigue with the 3D but that is going to vary from person to person.<br/><br/>Firefly is another feature that is exclusive to this phone. When you press the Firefly physical button on the left side of the phone it automatically launches the Firefly application. You can use it to scan products in their packages and check whether it is available on Amazon. You can use it on movies, books, CD, DVDs, foods, diapers etc. It can also scan phone numbers as well as addresses. I personally find it to be a hit and miss in this aspect. Sometimes it makes mistakes when detecting numbers. You can also activate Firefly when you are listening to a song or a movie and it will tell you what it is. It works really fast and I found it to be particularly useful when watching TV. When you use it to find a show it will give the information regarding the actors and the movie. It uses IMDB as a reference.<br/><br/>The regular Amazon app that comes in the Play Store has the ability to scan items just like Firefly but it will not scan for phone numbers, songs or movies. There is an app on the Play Store called Shazaam that can be used to scan songs that are playing on the background. So, as you can see, Firefly is a convenient feature but there are alternatives that you can use on other phones. So it is not necessarily a feature that makes this phone a must buy in my opinion. You will like Firefly if you like buying items directly from Amazon though. If you like to do comparison shopping you will probably use it often. The application is easy to use and makes buying from Amazon incredibly simple.<br/><br/>CAMERA<br/><br/>The phone comes with a 13 Megapixel camera. I was very pleased with the shots I managed to take. I found night time pictures to be above average for a cell phone. I found the phone took a 2-3 seconds to take each shot at nigh time but for the most part they came out relatively noise free. I took a few pictures during daytime and found it to be very nice also. The pictures had plenty of detail when you zoom them and the colors did not feel washed out. The only thing I would improve is the focusing and shutter time. The LG G3 and Galaxy S5 are quicker to focus. But honestly that is just nitpicking at this point. The camera is very good. I was satisfied.<br/><br/>The software and user interface of the camera app was very simple and easy to use. Not as feature packed as the one found on Galaxy S5 or Sony Xperia Z2 but that is not necessarily a bad thing. I prefer the clutter free interface better. Most of the critically important modes were present including HDR mode. HDR mode had a pretty natural effect. Other smartphones provide a very artificial and retouched feel in HDR mode.<br/><br/>As far as video is concerned you can take videos at 1080p resolution at 30 frames per second. The videos looked sharp but nothing out of the ordinary. For the most part they were relatively stable and were not shaky (by cell phone standards). Most high end cell phones are starting to come out with the ability to record at 4K resolution. That is not a priority now it may be in a couple of years once 4K TV prices start to lower their prices. This phone cannot do that. Keep this in mind if you are planning to get this phone.<br/><br/>As a bonus Amazon has offered unlimited cloud storage for pictures taken with this cell phone. Pretty sweet deal. I am not sure if videos are included though. I have not tried uploading any pictures because my internet connection is slow and it takes forever for me to do that.<br/><br/>APP STORE AND ECOSYSTEM<br/><br/>Amazon like other phones come with its own suite of apps. It comes with its very own its custom browser, calendar, email, maps and more. For the most part they are decent apps but not as refined as the Google apps. Keep in mind that you will not have access to any of the Google apps on this phone. That means you will not be able to use Google Chrome, Gmail, YouTube, Google Maps, or Google Music. That is a huge negative of this phone. If you are deeply entrenched in the Google ecosystem this may not be the phone for you.<br/><br/>Everything is not bad though. When you buy this cell phone you get one year access to Prime membership. That means you can get free two day shipping to many of the items found on Amazon. You also have access to Prime Instant Videos and Music. Neither one has a particularly large library but I always find something decent to watch. As of the time I am writing this review this is the only android cell phone with access to Amazon Prime Instant videos. However, I read that Amazon is going to be adding the Instant video app to the Play Store soon. That means other cell phones are going to be able to use it as well.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this phone does not have access to the Google Play Store. Instead you have to rely on the Amazon App Store to get your apps. Most of the big apps are available such as Facebook, Twitter, and Vine. It also has a lot of the most popular games. Where it falls short is with smaller apps. There is not nearly as much customization available. There are less available keyboards, launchers, and themes to choose from. When you dig deeper than the popular apps you will notice there are many apps missing that are available on the Play Store and the IOS App Store.<br/><br/>CUSTOMER SERVICE AND MAYDAY BUTTON<br/><br/>This phone comes with a feature called Mayday. When you activate this feature you get access to an Amazon live customer service rep that helps you operate the phone and answer any questions you might have about the user interface. They can even take control of the phone with your permission and show you step by step instructions in case you get stuck. The service is available 24/7 and it is free. It takes only about 15 seconds from the time you push the mayday button to the time you start talking to the agent. It is an invaluable tool for those people that are not good with technology and have a hard time adjusting to smartphones. It is excellent for first time smartphone users. This is a service that no other phone company can match at the moment.<br/><br/>I have dealt with Amazon for many year. I have purchased and sold hundreds of item on the website. Every time I have had a problem I have found the customer service to be helpful, efficient, and reliable. If you ever have any problem with the phone and it needs replacing it will take no more than a few minutes to talk to an agent and they will be ordering an exchange. The only other company that can match this level of service is Apple. I have tried dealing with Samsung, LG, and HTC and it has been a real pain to get decent customer service.<br/><br/>STORAGE<br/><br/>The base model of the phone comes with a 32 GB hard drive. There is also a 64 GB model available for $100 dollars more. Keep in mind there is no MicroSD card slot available. So what you see is what you get. There is no way to add more storage. I am using the 32 GB model. Only 23 GB was available out of the box.<br/><br/>BATTERY LIFE<br/><br/>This phone comes with a non-removable 2400 mah battery. Most smartphones have a battery life of at least a day. Most of the big android phones can last longer than that if you are careful and don't use the phone much. Amazon claims this phone can last a day with normal use. I barely made it to the end of the day before having to recharge the phone. I had to watch myself on more than one occasion or I would have the need to recharge by 3 p.m. This is while sending a few text, making a couple of calls, browsing the web for about an hour. I kept the brightness at about half way most of the time. The dynamic perspective seems to take a real toll on the battery. I could turn it off but then what is the purpose of buying this phone.<br/><br/>The battery life is disappointing, there is no getting around that. The fact that you can't remove it and replace it with another one makes it even worse. A real shame. Definitely one of the weakest points of this phone.<br/><br/>HEADPHONES AND AUDIO SPEAKERS<br/><br/>Along with the phone Amazon will also package a pair of headphones. The cable on the headphones is flat and has magnetic ear buds. This makes the headphones tangle free which is critical to the durability of headphones. I found the sound to be crisp and loud for small headphones. It is not audiophile quality but it will get the job done when you are on the go. As far as sound is concerned they are in the same category as Apple ear buds.<br/><br/>The phone has a set of dual speakers on the bottom of the phone. By cell phone standards they are pretty good. They are fairly loud and don't have a muddy sound like the one on the S5. I have not used them much though. I am more of a headphone person.<br/><br/> VALUE FOR $$$<br/><br/>This phone is very expensive, it costs $200 dollars with a 2 year contract and $650 dollars without one. All of the major premium manufacturers cost $100 with a contract. That includes the IPhone 5S, HTC One (M8), Samsung Galaxy S5 and the just released LG G3. If you are considering a phone off contract I would recommend the Nexus 5 from Google. For $350 you get a premium experience for nearly half the price of the Amazon Fire phone. Even with the free year of Prime membership and the headphones it still feels like a bad deal. It feels like Amazon really missed the boat on the price.<br/><br/>The other high end smartphones on the market come with a larger, better quality screen, a faster processor, and a better ecosystem. All cell phones have their pros and their cons, however, when you stack the Fire phone head to head you will see it comes up short just about every time.<br/><br/>Also keep in mind that the only carrier available is AT&T.; So you have no other choice in the matter. The phone comes locked into the network.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/><br/>So do I recommend this phone? Not really. Not at this price. The phone has a nice screen, good camera, and it is nicely built. However, its unique features are not enough to make me consider it over others in the market. The 3D capabilities are good and it has a lot of potential but as of right now it feels like a glorified Nintendo 3DS. Most of the 3D effect are prevalent on games and nothing more.<br/><br/>The phone has very mediocre battery life and I can't help but feel trapped in Amazon ecosystem. I miss the Google apps. I personally rely on Google Maps, Google Music, and Gmail every day.<br/><br/>The only people I would recommend this phone are those that are buying a smartphone for the first time. The Mayday technical support is fantastic and is very helpful for new comers. New comers are less likely to miss the useful Google apps that are absent on this smartphone. I was not impressed by the first edition of the Kindle Fire tablet but Amazon improved it considerably with future versions. I really hope they do the same with its phone. It really needs it.<br/><br/>I don't want to sound negative, the phone itself is pretty good. But I have to be honest. There are better options. I hope this review has helped you decide whether this phone is right for you. I thank you for having taken the time to read it. If you have any other questions regarding the phone please feel free to put it on the comment section and I will try to answer them to the best of my ability.
This is the Amazon phone you are looking for! Does everything Amazon which is great consider I have Kindle. This review will constantly be updated.  If you find this helpful, please press Yes below.<br/><br/>My profile: Heavy gadget users for personal and business purposes. I use my phone (Galaxy S5) quite a bit for personal use and iPhone 5 for work<br/><br/>I have the following and/or used the following before:<br/><br/>1) iPhone 5<br/>2) Galaxy S5<br/>3) Galaxy S3<br/>4) Wife's Moto X<br/>5) Galaxy Nexus<br/>6) Nexus One<br/>7) iPhone 3GS<br/><br/>I've been through many devices and also Kindle Fire Tablets. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year. I will provide a detail comparison between the smartphones I use and a little bit of Kindle Fire comparison (which uses similar OS).<br/><br/>Spec (8/10):<br/><br/>For Amazon first attempt, this is a very decent phone.  It has the speed of my wife's Moto X but not where it is for Galaxy S5.  However, this phone is built much differently for different purpose.  It's an "experience" phone rather than a "spec" phone.  Like an iPhone or Moto X, it provides a very tight experience to its Fire OS without needing any of the raw power that you get from Galaxy S5 to please you.  It's a phone that does "just enough" for all the things the OS is capable of doing for you<br/><br/>Screen (9/10):<br/>This screen is very nice.  At 720p, it may not have the clarity of the Galaxy S5 but beats the iPhone 5.  Video on this is crisp.  Running 720p content is absolutely fabulous on this device and no shadowing whatsoever.<br/><br/>Sound(8/10):<br/>The sound system in this Fire Phone is Digital Dolby Plus. This means lots of virtualization of sound and a good pair of earphones wlil help you go through your tracks.  Quality is on par with Galaxy S5 for low bitrate soundtrack but at higher bitrate, the Galaxy S5 maybe better with the 24-bit/192kHz DAC built in that the Fire Phone is lacking.  The earphone that comes with the device is very clever with magnetic pad to stick the earphones together and reduce tangle.<br/><br/>Build & Styling (7/10):<br/><br/>This Fire Phone is a sturdy piece of brick.  Yes, a brick I said because there's not much styling to it.  It's like holding a phone from 2010. Styling is more inline with the Nexus 4 with Glass back and the iPhone 3GS with round side.  People may think you are holding some cheapo knockoff phone without the Amazon logo on the back of the phone.  Definitely you won't impress your colleagues if you are going for the looks.  However, it does feel very sturdy and I can tell it can take some major drops.  I advise getting a case to stylize your phone<br/>Camera (8/10)<br/>The Camera on the Fire Phone is mediocre at best.  It's not as good as Galaxy S5 16MP ISOCELL camera but it serves it purpose.  There is Optical Image Stabilization on this camera which is done quite well and much less blurry shots that you expect from phones such as the Galaxy S5. Details won't be on par with Galaxy S5 but for those quick snap this is the phone to use.<br/><br/>The best part about the camera is not actually the camera but the free cloud storage on the camera.  You get UNLIMITED photo storage using the Fire Phone.  For the ones that go crazy snapping around all the time, you don't have to worry about storage space anymore.  Remember this is for photos and not for videos.  Videos still have storage limits.<br/><br/>Software & Experience (8/10):<br/>There are two major software that is the biggest feature on this phone<br/>Dynamic Perspective - This tracks your head movement by using the 5 cameras in the four corners of the Fire Phone's front face to track your head constantly. If you try to move your head or tilt your phone, your perspective will be align with the phone.  Special viewpoints are like the edge of icons, image focus that you don't see at other angles.  It's fun to play with but frankly a bit of a gimmick.<br/>Firefly - Click the firefly button on the phone and point it towards the item you want to purchase, and it will appear on your phone for purchase if available or recognized.  It's great idea but really only works around 50% of the time.  For example, it's definitely not useful if the item is not on Amazon's selection (which is possible surprisingly) or that it recognize it as something else.  Purchasing can't be more easier with this and it's a very good direction Amazon is taking for improve customer experience.  But until this can work more than 50% of the time, I will stick with the Amazon mobile store for purchases.<br/>The other apps are very similar to the Kindle Fire apps.  If you are using a Kindle Fire, this should be easy for you to use and navigate.  Things like Mayday is still available on the phone which is definitely useful for people who are less tech savvy.  I will find this very useful for my mom so that she can ask Mayday rep the tech questions instead of me!<br/><br/>This phone is definitely not as open as actual Android phones such as Galaxy S5.  Although Fire OS is based on Android, it is still a very closed system and it's Amazon every intention to keep you in their ecosystem.  If you are like me who have Amazon Prime, this device is a godsend.  All your instant video/musics/purchase is tightly intergrated to this smartphone.  If you live by Amazon, this is the phone to get.  However, if you like to play around with things such as custom ROMs then it's best to stay off this phone.  You won't be getting the type of freedom on customization that you get on Android.<br/><br/>Battery (6.5/10):<br/>Battery life is quite good given the phone is not top specification.  However, the Dynamic Perspective and Firefly can drain your battery quite fast if you use it constantly.  Unfortunately, you cannot remove the battery of the phone and replace it with another (which Galaxy S5 has and it is very handy feature to have) so you better be careful how you use your phone.<br/><br/>Complimentary Accessories (6/10):<br/>There are quite a number of cases out for the Fire Phone at launch which is great.  Additionally the accessories that come with the phone such as the earphone are very good.<br/><br/>Value (6/10):<br/>This is a very hard one to write about.<br/>On one hand, you get one full year of Prime membership for free which is 99 dollars in value + unlimited photo storage (which can be quite expensive if you are using other cloud service to storage over 1000 GB of photos)<br/><br/>On the other hand, you are lock down to all Amazon services + AT&T; exclusivity + mediocre specification (though enough for this phone as I mentioned) + $200 on contract for 32gb which is as expensive as some high end phones available today<br/><br/>For value, it really comes down to how often you use Amazon.  If you are an Amazonholic, then this phone will not disappoint you. However, if you don't even have Amazon Prime to begin with or that you are not locked down currently to any Amazon service, this device can be quite expensive for getting into Amazon services.<br/><br/>Conclusion in one sentence: Great for CURRENT Amazon service users & not so great for anyone not locked into their system yet.<br/><br/>Perhaps Amazon needs to rethink its pricing strategy for this device.  For current Amazon customers such as myself who know Amazon good service that we are currently locked into, this is a great upgrade to enhance the shopping experience of Amazon and to enjoy all the Amazon Prime services on my most frequently used device.  However, it can be quite expensive sacrifice for newcomers to Amazon ecosystem especially this phone is not cheap (unlike the Kindle Fire) and that the mediocre specs are not selling itself.  Especially with AT&T; exclusivity, I don't see how this device will be flying off the shelf (think Facebook phone).  What Amazon should do is to reprice this to cheaper bracket (Free on 2 year contract at least) or let people try using this phone for free for a limited amount of time.  Dynamic Perspective and Firefly are just not enough to sell the phone to newcomers.<br/><br/>As mentioned, I will update this review periodically. Next time I will focus on physical wear and tear of the machine after couple more months and again on battery life (as all electronics have a diminishing battery duration throughout its course of use). [...] Thanks for reading!
Extremely sad and dissatisfied with this product. I have been looking forward to this phone for a while now and it saddens me to give it a bad review. Not everything's bad about this phone, but the cons are greater than the pros.<br/>Pros:<br/>- The form factor of the phone itself is excellent.<br/>- Nice size screen.<br/>- Amazing speakers. I have never stumbled upon a cellphone with such an amazing sound quality.<br/>- Instant access to the camera at the touch of a button.<br/>- Beautifully designed; very elegant.<br/>- Access to Mayday which is super helpful.<br/>- Average picture quality.<br/>- 12 months of prime included.<br/>- Very fast internet browser.<br/>- Firefly works just as announced.<br/>- The earbuds are pretty decent. The flat part doesn't tangle; can't say much about the rest of it.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- The battery life is absolutely horrendous. Amazon promises "Fire phone delivers up to 285 hours of standby time, up to 22 hours of talk time, up to 65 hours of audio playback, and up to 11 hours of video playback" This is the biggest lie that any company has ever made. I don't know why Amazon is claiming such a thing when it's not nearly close to be true. I took the phone to work this morning with 98% battery life. I checked my Instagram during my fifteen minute break, and read my email as well. The phone was on 2% by 10AM. I wasn't running Bluetooth, GPS, or wifi, nor was I streaming music or videos (more about videos later); just a simple thing such as checking my email and looking at my Instagram feed for about fifteen minutes.<br/><br/>- The phone gets super hot. I understand that electronic devices get warm once in a while depending on how much you're using it, but Fire Phone wasn't warm, it was HOT! I guess that's why it's called Fire Phone. Joke aside, the phone does get extremely uncomfortably hot even whilst you're not even using it. I had it in my front pocket and had to take it out because the warmth was bothering me.<br/><br/>- The camera takes decent photos; nothing to drool for. The picture button comes in handy and is very simple to use. Everything's nice and dandy until you get home and realize you're phone spent all day taking photos of the inside of your pocket. I don't weak skinny jeans or anything tight. I had my phone in my messenger bag and it took four photos of the inside of the bag. The hardware picture button is too easily pressed.<br/><br/>- I know that Amazon talked about how amazing Dynamic Perspective was, and all I've got to say is Thank God there's a way to turn it off, because all it did was to give me a headache. Some people might like it, but I thought it was just too gimmicky. Auto scroll worked 75% of the time as expected. And why do I need to tilt my phone to "peek" on my status bar?? Annoying.<br/><br/>- The lack of YouTube and Snapchat are a bummer. I'm sure they'll arrive eventually, but there aren't available as of right now.<br/><br/>- There's no way to organize your apps in different folders, so be ready to scroll and scroll to find the one app you're looking for.<br/><br/>- You can't pin anything to the home screen because there isn't one. All there is is a carousel with your most recent apps.<br/><br/>- You need to swipe up to go back. How does this make any sense again?<br/><br/>It makes me sad that I had to give such a horrible review to the Fire Phone because I love Amazon. I've owned three kindles and never had any issues with them, but it seems like they released a promising phone way too soon. I just spoke to the customer representative and  he sent me a return label for a full refund. I wish things were different.<br/><br/>** UPDATE **<br/>Amazon was extremely helpful when it came to return the phone. They emailed me a shipping label and refunded me the money within two days.
Amazon had some good ideas with the phone, but many of the daily uses of the phone are absolutely worthless. I love Amazon products and we even have two Kindle Fires in our house, so I thought the phone would be amazing as well. I was VERY wrong. I knew that some of the common apps were not on the phone yet, which I could live with but there were many things that made having this phone worse than any other phone I have ever had.<br/>1. It gets incredibly hot, I was on the phone for less than 5 minutes when I had to turn it on speaker and put it on a table to talk because it was burning my face.<br/>2. There is no back button. Yes, you should be able to move your hand a certain way to go back or turn pages but most times nothing worked and I would have to just return to my home screen and start again.<br/>3. The battery life is terrible, I charged it for over 6 hours and it only had 80% at 6:00am, by 9:30am it was completely dead.<br/>4. The battery would only charge if the phone was turned off. SERIOUSLY?<br/><br/>In conclusion, I will NEVER get a first generation phone again. I am very highly dissatisfied with the Amazon Fire phone and do not recommend it to anyone. I am planning on switching to a Galaxy S5. Amazon should have tested this phone out more before releasing it to the public, it is really sad that this phone is this bad.
The phone has many good ideas which were poorly executed.  Let me list just a few of the issues that I've had with this phone after using it for 2 weeks.<br/><br/>- The dynamic perspective is fun in theory, but becomes annoying in lower light when it senses your face or somebody next to you and makes the objects on the screen bounce left and right jarringly.<br/>- If the phone doesn't sense your face in the dark it will turn on and then off again. It might take 2 or 3 trys.<br/>- If the phone thinks its senses a face (just guessing) it won't shut off (black the screen) and your pocket will start to feel very warm.<br/>- motion controls (which were a big selling point in their marketing and in my purchase decision) work about 50% of the time.<br/>- No Hulu app...? seriously<br/>- if your contacts have the number one in front i.e. 1 (###) ###-####; it will say that it is an invalid contact for group messages and image texting, so I've had to go through hundreds of contacts to delete these 1's<br/><br/>I know that some issues can be resolved with OS updates, but in the meantime, it is almost too frustrating to use the phone.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this phone, but I should have went with my gut and waited for the next model.
WARNING!<br/>My AT&T; app is preloaded on the phone, and you cannot delete it, or change the permissions it has.<br/>And the permissions it has are the biggest problem I've encountered with this phone by far.<br/>This app has some scary permissions, but the one that really bothered me is the following:<br/><br/>Camera<br/>Allows the app to take pictures and videos with the camera. This permission allows the app to use the camera at any time without your confirmation.<br/>( that is word for word!)
Okay...I purposely waited a few days to review this phone.  Absolutely hated it and was going to return it on the first day (Thursday).  Second day, I decided to give the phone a chance.  Today (Monday) I am liking the phone but there still are issues.<br/><br/>-  The Keyboard - small - no way to make it bigger and cannot download another keyboard app.<br/><br/>-  Sound - the speakers sound a bit tinny - the sound is good through the earphones though.<br/><br/>-  Call answering - the decline call button is on the left (it was on the right on all of my previous phones) so I have been declining calls by mistake.<br/><br/>-  Camera button - it is so close to the sound buttons I am constantly hitting it by mistake (will take some getting used to but I can live with it)<br/><br/>-  Battery Life - seems to be getting better the longer I use the phone but still not wonderful.  Initially the phone had a battery life of about 4-6 hrs.  After turning off a lot of the push notifications i.e. email and apps, the battery life now is much longer but still not where it needs to be.  Will followup on this matter again later.<br/><br/>-  Apps - knew going into the phone it was going to be an issue but expect that since Amazon wants to sell the phone they will work on the app issue.  Frankly this is something that should have been address PRIOR to release instead of after.<br/><br/>- Wifi - not sure what the issue is here.  The wifi signal is about half of what it should be BUT I have not had any problems connecting and downloading apps. I have not attempted to stream yet and this is where it will likely make the difference.  Not sure why the wifi signal is so low, this is the only device that I have this issue with.  I will followup to this post if this is an issue with streaming.<br/><br/>- Dynamic perspective - this feature is great, especially if you are a gamer.  Now time for more content! (Amazon are you listening??!!!)<br/><br/>- Firefly - only tried it a few times. It worked perfectly on books, music and TV shows.  It did not recognize any products I scanned.  Good Feature but database needs to be developed more.<br/><br/>-  Photos - photo quality is excellent.  I love the ability to add a photo by swiping in email.  Very convenient!<br/><br/>My thoughts on this phone is that perhaps it was rushed out before it was ready.  I understand they spent four years working on it but 6 more months after beta testing probably wouldn't have hurt. Getting this type of feedback before release could mean the difference between success and failure.  Probably very avoidable because I see that alot of people are having the same issues and/or complaints and a lot of the issues are software based.<br/><br/>What is good with this phone is very good.  The hardware itself appears to be well made.  Screen is very clear.  The auto brightness seems to be a bit dark.<br/><br/>Amazon has a good product here hopefully they will listen to theiir customers and update the software to address the issues. Amazon does have a game changing phone on their hands.  The question is will they fix the issues and have a better phone or will another manufacture to do and steal their thunder.<br/><br/>AMAZON!!!  Take note please:  It should be a good phone first and a marketing tool second. Not the other way around.<br/> And secondly, it's a phone, not a kindle, some changes/differences are necessary.<br/><br/>Bottom line - As of today, I am keeping the phone and am hoping that Amazon addresses as many of the issues as possible with software updates.  If not, one year from now I will own another phone.<br/><br/>I have been with Amazon for years.  They have always been a customer service oriented company so I have faith that they will do the right thing here.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/><br/>I realized while using the phone that there is no notification in the top bar of the phone. i.e. voicemail icon.  The notifications appear in the pull down but not at the top.  No way to make it that way either. I was told that the top bar was intentionally left uncluttered.  I think this is a good choice Amazon but we need to have a voicemail notification that readily visible on the phone.  My suggestions to Amazon, remove the Silk Icon and replace it with the voicemail icon. So the top icons on the first screen would then be: Phone, Messaging, Email and Voicemail.  Makes a bit more common sense.<br/><br/>I have used the Mayday app twice now to address concerns.  Amazon seems to really want to hear about the issues and each time they have sent my concerns up for review to see if the matters can be addressed (at least they told me they would).  That makes me hopeful.  The techs on the other end have been as helpful as they could be.<br/><br/>Also, battery much better today.  It has lasted all day and is now at 43%.  Not sure why it was so bad on the first few days but it seems to be getting just a little bit better each day.  I did turn off a lot of app notifications, the default on the phone is to enable ALL app notifications regardless of the app.  Perhaps the default should be to disable and let the user make the decision.<br/><br/>7/31/14<br/><br/>Battery is now lasting about a day as long as I don't stream music or video which admittedly would be an issue on any phone.  But...the battery life is still not comparable to other phones on the market today.<br/><br/>9/23/14<br/><br/>Felt compelled to return and update my review on this phone.  Having given the phone some time after the update I am sorry to say that I'm not in love with the phone.  Even more, I'm not particularly in "like" with the phone.  To top it off, the price of the phone has been cut $200.00 and no refund in sight for me.<br/><br/>I really was hoping that Amazon would come through with an update to this phone that was going to make me fall in love with it.  So far....nothing but crickets!!!  Battery life sucks...the amazon appstore has not stepped up to the plate and produced...and since the first update, the phone has become unresponsive at times and I am forced to fully restart. I'm also still waiting for apps that take advantage of the dynamic perspective.<br/><br/>Come on Amazon!!!!  Get with the program!!!
I've had the Fire Phone for about a month now. Prior to the Fire Phone, I had an iPhone 5. After reading some of the poor reviews, I decided to write one myself. I have been extremely happy with the phone.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Amazon ecosystem: As a Prime member, I get seamless access to all the Prime content (Kindle books, free streaming video, cloud storage). You can even download movies/tv shows for free and watch them offline.<br/>-Mayday/Customer Service: The interface takes a bit to get used to (i.e. swiping up is the back button) and so I had to contact customer service a few times. You can contact Mayday in the touch of a button, with someone taking over control of your phone and assisting you in seconds. You can also send "feedback" and an Amazon rep will e-mail you with a response within a few hours.<br/>-Battery Life: Since the software update, the battery life is much improved and a strength of the device. It definitely lasts longer than my iPhone 5. I have been using the phone regularly all day (web searching, checking e-mail, texting) and I am still at 50% battery. The same could not be said about my iPhone.<br/><br/>Cons/Disappointments:<br/>-Dynamic Perspective and Firefly: Funny enough, two of Amazon's selling points have been my disappointments with the phone. Dynamic Perspective works well, but at this point, it doesn't have much use. Firefly works well when it recognizes an item (i.e a cereal box) but it still does not recognize items seamlessly like I hoped it would.<br/>-App Store: Without the Google Play store, Amazon still has a way to go with the App Store. It has most of the major apps but I find myself sometimes wanting to download an app to find it not being available on the Fire Phone (i.e. Venmo, Lyft, BofA Banking).<br/><br/>All together, I am very happy with the phone. It definitely still has room for improvement, but the phone's weaknesses are software issues. I am a big Amazon fan and I have no doubt Amazon will continue to develop the phone's capabilities in the future. They will keep sending software updates, adding new apps, and hopefully will improve the usage of Dynamic Perspective.<br/><br/>For those complaining about paying $199 for the phone, contact customer service and get a refund! Amazon has released publicly for you to contact customer service and you will receive the $199! For $.99, including a full year of Prime, the phone is a great value. I realize that the price ties you into a contract, but so does paying the subsidized prices for an iPhone or Samsung device. Including the year of Prime, the Fire Phone is $300 cheaper than the iPhone 6 and Samsung Galaxy 5.<br/><br/>I normally don't write reviews, but after seeing some of the negative feedback I had to add my input!
5 Oct 2014 UPDATE<br/><br/>The phone is still great. Unfortunately, the reviews do not reflect the reality of the Fire Phone, just the prejudices of some reviewers (both in the media and on this site):<br/><br/>1) It is not an iPhone and it is not a generic android phone. It uses Amazon's own operating system which is heavily based on android, but it is not the android that some people want. Google does not recognize it as android, so access is denied to googlePlay and googleServices by google. If you want an android phone, do not buy this phone. Amazon is not Apple. If you want an iPhone, do not buy this phone.<br/><br/>2) It is heavily integrated with services provided by Amazon. If you are not interested in Amazon services (books, videos, music, games, apps, the webstore, Amazon Cloud Drive), do not buy this phone. You won't like to and you will feel you are being pressured to use Amazon services because they are so seamlessly available from the phone. I use Amazon services almost exclusively for my digital purchases. I love the seamless integration. However, if I bought most of my digital purchases from Apple or google, I would not like this phone.<br/><br/>3) If you want a phone powered by rats spinning in a wheel, don't buy this phone. It uses real electrical energy powered by sources from the existing power grid in the United States, both for the phone itself and the cloud services it supports.<br/><br/>4) If you want a phone that works exactly like the phone you have now, don't buy it. It is not exactly like the phone you currently have.<br/><br/>5) If you do not want to use ATT as a provider, don't buy the phone. It won't work. Wait until the exclusivity ends and other carriers can offer it.<br/><br/>6) If you want stellar customer service, buy the phone from Amazon, not ATT. There are two extremes in customer service: Amazon is on one end and ATT is on the other. Unfortunately, you still have to deal with ATT for phone service issues. I have for years. I hate ATT, but they are the only game in town for this phone today. Get over it. I did. There is no such thing as a good telephone service provider, in the United States or in any other country I have worked in or lived in. It is the nature of phone services. They make money by having massive numbers of customers who each spend tiny amounts of money (relative to their total revenues). All customers are expendable because they can easily be replaced by others. They don't like you and you shouldn't like them. They are commercial enterprises, not your friend. Don't expect love. The same is true of Amazon. It is trying to build a business based on exceptional customer service. If and when they decide another business strategy is better for their owners, they will do it. But for now, Amazon can't be beat for customer service and a commitment to testing new markets and products (that are affordable).<br/><br/>I have nothing to modify in my original review below, except for a few comments:<br/><br/>1) My phone was unlocked by ATT (I am an existing customer). I have been using it in Europe and Africa with 3 different providers and the phone works flawlessly, both using the cellular network and in connecting to available wifi hotspots. It works better than my Nokia and Samsung phones did in poor reception areas in Africa. Europe has better reception than the US in every country I work, so it is not an issue for any phone.<br/><br/>2) Some minor issues were resolved by the original update in August. Amazon announced that the new version of its operating system (being rolled out with the new Fire tablets) will be available for the phone early next year. I personally don't have any issues with the current operating system, but some people may feel it is too limited in options, especially those used to pure android phones which have so many options you can't actually figure out how to configure them.<br/><br/>3) The phone is exceptionally well built and durable. I only have the Amazon back case, but the phone looks like new and I have dropped it a lot (although not from a balcony or a cliff). Within 2 months of getting my Samsung S3 I had to purchase an Otter Case because the phone looked like it had been polished with course sand.<br/><br/>4) I, like everyone else who asked, got a $200 refund within hours of asking. Another example of Amazon's customer service. The price of one of the first versions of the iPhone had a price drop pretty quickly and Steve Jobs apologized. I prefer a refund.<br/><br/>For those buying the phone, enjoy it. For those looking for that energy-free alternative, good luck finding it.<br/><br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>I have had my Fire Phone (64gb, no contract) for about two weeks and thought it was a time to write a review since so many of the reviews (especially the negative ones) are from trolls who have never seen, much less used, the Fire Phone. We actually have two of the phones. I am a confirmed Amazon user, and will continue to be one as long as Amazon offers the best customer service of any company, government agency, school, or employer I have experienced. However, my loyalty is only as deep as Amazon's ability to maintain that level of quality service and products. Having said that, the Fire Phone is certainly consistent with what I expected from Amazon.<br/><br/>First of all, it is not perfect. This is version 1, and like versions 1 of the Kindle reader and the Kindle Fire, I am confident that Amazon will improve the product rapidly. I am certain we will see software upgrades soon for most of the minor glitches users have noted.<br/><br/>Overall, I really like this phone. I wasn't expecting that in light of the mostly negative or lukewarm pre-reviews in the tech press. It has quickly become the phone of choice for me and my wife. We have sold or given away our Samsung Galaxy 3's (good riddance) and my Nokia 820 Windows phone (a really good phone, but severely limited by the tiny Windows Phone ecosystem).<br/><br/>Google, Apple, or Amazon Devices?<br/><br/>If you are a heavy user of Amazon services and/or Kindle Fire, the choice of this phone is a no brainer. It really works well in integrating with the Kindle Fire and with Amazon services. If you are a heavy user of google services or iStuff, this is definitely not the phone for you. Although the Fire OS is android-based, it is not pure android (which makes me happy). Because of that Google will not allow it to be used for googlePlay or most other services. There are work-arounds to get Chrome, google maps, and youtube, but that is about it. Of course, you can get gmail on this phone (although syncing contacts and calendar will require a complicated work-around (search for several methods on the Internet with the search term "google apps on Kindle Fire"). If you are a google and/or open android fanatic, you will hate this phone. For Apple junkies, it is even clearer that this is not the phone for you. Don't even consider it unless you are switching to the Amazon ecosystem.<br/><br/>ATT is it for now, whether you like it or not.<br/><br/>I am a confirmed ATT hater, but also a longtime trapped customer of ATT because of my needs. There are few companies with worse customer service or marketing/sales trickery than ATT (except, depending on your experience, Verizon, Sprint, T-mobile, US Cellular, and every other phone carrier, cable company, and bank you can name), but they have the best coverage in many parts of the country and it made sense for Amazon to launch with exclusivity (just like the first iPhones did, as well as original Kindle Fire 4G). ATT has been supplementing Amazon's marketing well so far. The exclusivity will end at some point, probably not too far off.<br/><br/>The good news is the phone is not loaded with ATT  junk apps, unlike Samsung phones. In fact, no ATT apps at all.<br/><br/>I have a no contract phone because I need it unlocked for international travel. Currently, ATT's policy is to unlock no contract phones for existing customers after 60 days, so mine can be unlocked in another 6 weeks (I am counting). The other good news is this phone is capable of using almost every protocol in use in the world, so it can be used almost anywhere (except North Korea and a few other places). That is one thing ATT does right, unlike some other companies.<br/><br/>Heat?<br/><br/>Several reviewers commented that the phone gets hot. Every device I have ever had gets hot at first when setting it up (a lot is going on). For both our phones, they didn't get noticeably warm after the first couple of days.<br/><br/>Feel and build<br/><br/>The phone is a nice size and weight. It is perfect for both of us for one-handed use and it doesn't make you look like you are holding a book to your ear like larger phones. It doesn't feel like a cheap piece of plastic, like my Samsung Galaxy. On the other hand, it won't win any design awards. So what.<br/><br/>Only 720p!!<br/><br/>Several comments (from posters who obviously have never seen the phone) relate to the 720p resolution. It is almost impossible to tell the difference between 720p and 1080p screens at this size and use distance. In fact, pixel count is more important, and this phone has better resolution than most phones (it does record video in 1080). I have terrible vision and can use this phone easily without reading glasses, unlike my Galaxy. It also has the best outdoor display of any phone I have tried (even better than my Nokia Lumia 820, which is pretty good). Works well with sunglasses. Actually, the phone's display resolution and brightness is one of its best features.<br/><br/>Where are my google apps?<br/><br/>The Amazon app store is much smaller than googlePlay or the iStore. However, it doesn't have hundreds of thousands apps that don't really work (yes, I mean googlePlay). It does have a good selection of mainstream apps, and I am happy except for a few favorites that are not available, but will certainly be available soon. It is very simple to convert android apps for use on Amazon products, so I am sure most popular apps will be available soon (the same as was the case with the Kindle Fire when it was first released). However, a lot of specialized apps will probably never be available unless Amazon sells a lot more phones than is likely, so there will never be the selection available for the iPhone (especially business-related apps).<br/><br/>Bluetooth and sound<br/><br/>It does not currently support bluetooth low energy (4.0), but Amazon has said the chip is capable and there will be a software update rolled out to enable it. That bluetooth version is necessary to support a number of new devices that sync data via Bluetooth (like fitness devices).<br/><br/>The built-in speakers are okay, but nothing to brag about. Pairing with Bluetooth is easy and stable. I use a Bose earbud, which paired flawlessly and works really well in every way with the Fire Phone). I have also paired bluetooth my 3 different bluetooth speaker without any problems.<br/><br/>BTW, the included wired earbuds are very good (if they fit your ears). Unfortunately, they are one size fits all.<br/><br/>Settings<br/><br/>One of my irritations is with the poorly organized, deeply complex settings on other android phones. The Fire Phone has easy to find settings and they are logically organized. They are somewhat limited at this point (although several note that more settings will be available in the future).<br/><br/>Voice commands<br/><br/>The Siri-like voice function works pretty well for a new product. I use it a lot, something I did not do with my Galaxy. It is especially useful for looking up phone contacts, dictating SMS messages and short emails. Searching the Internet with voice has worked almost flawlessly for me. Verdict: I predict the voice function will become one of the strongest features of the Fire Phone.<br/><br/>Dynamic Perspective<br/><br/>Nice gimmick that I assume will be integrated into more apps in the future. The "peek" function works pretty well in keeping the screens uncluttered (especially in maps). I like it and hope it will develop.<br/><br/>Firefly<br/><br/>Very limited right now. Takes me a long time to get objects recognized. Mostly good for scanning bar and QR codes at this point, but this should also be a great function in the future. The advantage of Amazon's version is that it is available for app developers to integrate into their products. That should make it very useful.<br/><br/>Camera<br/><br/>Better than my Samsung, Nokia, and Kindle Fire cameras. I like it, especially the simple but robust video function.<br/><br/>Side panels<br/><br/>One of the best features for me is the left and right side panels. They work well, especially on the home page. The left panel serves the function of the top level tabs on the Kindle Fire to access each of the Amazon services. The right panel keeps track of current calendar, email, and text messages, as well as the weather. The device flicks are easy to use (once you practice a bit). They are also easily accessible with finger swipes. Again, I assume they will be integrated into apps over time.<br/><br/>Tilt to scroll<br/><br/>Only works in the Silk browser right now, but is scheduled to be included in an update to the Kindle reading app soon. Works well for me. I like it.<br/><br/>Customization<br/><br/>Limited now, as it was with the first generations of the Kindle readers and Fires. I expect it to get more robust over time. One thing needed is an option to control font size outside of apps.<br/><br/>General<br/><br/>I like this phone very much. I should mention that it works very well as a phone (voice quality, reception, etc.). Much better than my Samsung Galaxy as as well as my Nokia Lumia 820. I am happy I bought it, would do it again, and look forward to its development as a preferred alternative for heavy Amazon users that don't want to be pestered by gimmicky google and phone carrier apps. Amazon deserves a lot of credit for trying to create a phone that optimizes functions that are most useful on a smartphone. If you are not as heavy a user of Amazon services as I am (almost my exclusive source of everything I buy if available from Amazon.com), you might want to wait for version 2. If you don't use Amazon for stuff, don't buy it. If you want to use iStuff on your phone, don't buy it. If you love and want to use google services on your phone, don't buy it. Everyone has different preferences. For me, this is the phone I have been waiting for.
I love all things Amazon and especially Kindle so it was with great sorrow - and I do not exaggerate - that I returned the phone  to ATT four days after purchasing it. The phone had to constantly be rebooted. The wireless barely worked.When in Washington DC last week for a meeting I could access neither the WiFi nor my 4G service so I could not access my email at all.<br/><br/>There are facets of the phone that I did love: Anything Amazon works amazingly well including your Kindle content, music and instant video. In addition, it was easy for me to sync my iTunes music, which I greatly appreciated. Also, the screen on the phone is amazing so it made watching a video a great pleasure.<br/><br/>However, at this price point I expected flawless performance and I did not receive it. Finally, I had to pay a $35 restocking fee to ATT in order to return the phone which I found to be nearly intolerable. As an early adopter of many technologies, I know that things do not always work they are intended. But even with this being the first phone, I expected better from the Amazon Fire Phone. It's just not ready for Prime Time.
I love Amazon. I have been buying with them for years. I am a Prime member and have been for a couple years. I bought the Kindle as an early adopter. The Fire TV was disappointing because the thing has had to be reset to factory twice in less than 4 months. The voice search only works for Amazon,  so it's not a feature that gets used. I thought a Fire phone would be amazing.  Not so. I bought one and was willing to be gouged by AT&T; just to have this phone. Then AT&T; wanted over $100 a month for basically the same service I have with T-Mobile.  OK. Not cool, but I really wanted this phone.<br/>Then I had it got out of the box and charged it %100. It was hard to leave it alone while it charged.  Finally got to %100 and started to mess around with settings and ring tones.  Was underwhelmed right away with the OS. It felt a bit off. Then the true letdown happened.  The apps are seriously lacking. While searching for some pretty basic Android or IOS apps that weren't available,  I noticed the phone was getting way to warm. Then I realized the battery was at %72. I had only been using it for about 35 minutes.<br/>Lack off apps.<br/>Poor operating system.<br/>Short battery life.<br/>AT&T; is the worst.<br/>It gets way too warm way too quickly.<br/>In the end I'll wait for the 3rd or 4th iteration. Maybe it will be available unlocked. Maybe it will have a real OS. Maybe it won't get hot. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe. Until then get a real Android phone like a Galaxy. Or get an IOS or Windows phone.
I think the biggest obstacle the Fire phone has had to overcome are the negative reviews, often given by people who don't own or haven't used this phone.  Followers of the "big two" platforms, they feel threatened by the newcomer.<br/><br/>I've had the Fire Phone for about six weeks now and still have no regrets, I like it and will consider buying another one when the time comes.<br/><br/>This phone wasn't meant to put Android or Apple out of business, it is simply a phone for the rest of us.  I'm a confirmed Apple-fanatic, never believing that I would stray from an iPhone, but I'm tired of constantly installing updates, upgrading operating systems and buying new computers and tablets just so everything will continue to work together in harmony.  It gets expensive and I'll give Steve Jobs credit for his great marketing strategy, which is why Apple is number one.  I just wanted to look at alternatives.<br/><br/>I did a lot of comparative shopping between the iPhone 5s, Galaxy S5 and Fire.  The iPhone was always my favorite, simple and familiar.  I spent a lot of time researching the Galaxy since I recently purchased a Chromebook, but I took notice to all the hardware and software issues that users were having and eventually decided against it.<br/><br/>I waited patiently for the debut of the Amazon phone and really wasn't wowed when I first tried it out.  Situated between a 5s and an S5, it didn't stand much of a chance.  (Not sure who's fault product placement was: AT&T; or Amazon).  After running the Demo model through it's paces for 30 minutes, the heat emanating from the Fire turned me off.  (Although I will give Amazon credit, they resolved that issue by the next time I was in the store.)<br/><br/>I was in and out of AT&T; about six times over the course of three weeks, always giving the Fire a few more tries.  Eventually, it grew on me.  Call it economics, I feel like I'm getting more bang for the buck.  I don't have the choice of 100,000 apps and games, but being practical, I don't need (or want) that many.  I researched the ones that mattered most to me and all were available from Amazon App store and they work flawlessly.<br/><br/>Battery life was my biggest concern and the charges continue to get stronger with time.  My phone stays on 24/7 and I now charge it about twice a week.<br/><br/>Can't beat Amazon for entertainment.  This ASAP technology is wonderful and I have no buffering issues even with intermittent wifi.  Great job Amazon!  These little no-tangle "one size fits all" ear buds are nice too.  Most comfortable I've ever worn with good sound quality.  My Bose IE2's are now listed on eBay, I'm perfectly happy with Amazons.<br/><br/>Firefly is convenient, I love comparative shopping and always go to Amazon to obtain product reviews anyway.  Rather or not you buy from Amazon is up to you, they certainly aren't forcing you to and I think it is a nice gesture that I can so easily use their products to retrieve the information I need when shopping.<br/><br/>Dynamic Perspective is cool in my opinion.  I'm prone to motion sickness and VR sensitivity and it doesn't make me sick.  Pretty cool with a couple games I did download.  Always admire the lock-screen with plenty of scenes to choose from.<br/><br/>Free photo storage for life?  Wow, that's priceless!  Getting all my iPhone photos secured before wiping it clean to sell was a really pain in the ...<br/>The photos I've taken look good and mysteriously show up on my Kindle tablet as well.  How cool, cloud storage that isn't going to cost me $$$ every few years buying new computers and iPads.  (No offense Apple).<br/><br/>Doesn't sync with Google?  Having recently purchased a Chromebook is probably the only reason I strayed from Apple products to start with.  I don't know what people are trying to sync, I do know all my contacts, emails and calendar info updates quickly in the background with the Fire phone.<br/><br/>Maybe some of you people expect too much from this phone, you think?<br/>You need 100+ apps on your phone because it makes you look cool.<br/>You have to have Android just because it's Android and you like problems.  (Face it, you love Windoze computers too don't you?)  Apple users, thank you for making the switch and helping Apple become #1 while Steve Jobs was alive to see it.<br/><br/>For the rest of us, there's the Fire phone.<br/>It is what it is and if you are into the Amazon ecosystem with Kindle books, Audible Audiobooks, Prime music, videos or even shopping, you may very well love this little phone.  I know I love mine.<br/><br/>Make an informed decision by what you need, not what other people are trying to sway you into doing.  If you take this little phone out for a test drive, you may find yourself quite happy with it and the benefits it offers you,
Really wanted to like this phone, but alas... its just not very good.<br/><br/>First I'd like to say that I am HEAVILY vested in the Amazon ecosystem.  I use all their services and have packages on my door every week.  I use my phone to buy products all the time, and I am constantly comparing amazon prices anytime I'm at the mall.  My friends are sick of hearing "its cheaper on Amazon" I'm sure.<br/><br/>But here are some of my qualms about this phone.<br/><br/>Firefly: Neat feature that works great, however for 50% of the phone's flagship fleet, it isn't unique to the fire phone.  Open the Amazon app on any other phone and search using the FLOW feature. Viola, you have firefly, or at least the product identification portion of it.  There are apps that will ID songs for you, the only feature unique to the fire phone is the TV/Movie ID feature, but with even with DTV received through bunny ears, you can ID what you're watching.<br/><br/>Dynamic perspective:  It is very neat, yes, but if you want to experience this feature go to an ATT store and play with it for 10 mins.  The apps that featured dynamic perspective felt awkward while using.  Regular tilt apps work the same if not better.  The fire phone will track your head, yes, but why not just tilt the phone around?<br/><br/>Mayday:  When Amazon launched mayday, many were skeptical.  In a world of automated help lines and long wait times how can you expect to get a live video stream within seconds?  Mayday works great on this phone, however the quality of service is lacking.  During launch week I expected everyone to be excited and helpful, however it was as if the MayDay reps had never seen the phone before.  My questions were met with long pauses as they searched through their help guide.  And many times it was concluded that "the phone can't do that yet, but I will file a ticket on the issue."<br/><br/>FireOS: As you've probably read the lack of google play store and google apps is a big bummer.  I found that most the Apps that I used on my previous android were not available on the amazon app store.  I assume the 1000 coins ($10) included for premium apps is intended to help with the transition, but that didn't help.  Overall I felt incredibly limited with what I could do with the FireOS and amazon app store.  I use android over apple for the freedom of customization.<br/><br/>I concluded that this phone would be great for someone who had previous experience with Apple devices and wanted to try something similar.  After spending a week trying to find a reason to keep the phone I decided to send it to my 50 year old mother to replace her aging iphone 3GS.  However she kindly sent it back to me, stating that the gestures were confusing.  She found herself tilting the phone accidentally and having extra information/sidebars pop up on her while trying to use the phone.<br/><br/>Other cons:<br/>Overheating - I left my Fire and my Galaxy S2 in my truck one day while I was at work and after they both baked in the Texas heat, the Fire was hot to the touch and powered down, while the old S2 was still going strong!<br/><br/>The camera button was the greatest thing about this phone.  I almost kept it just because it was so nice to be able to snap a picture with just 2 button presses, but in the end that wasn't enough to justify the $199 price tag.<br/><br/>===========================================E-D-I-T============================<br/><br/>With the new price dropping $198.01 this phone is actually quite a deal, especially when you consider that the free year of prime is still included!  If you already use and love prime, Amazon is essentially paying you $98 to try their phone.  And if you aren't a prime member they're basically giving you a free phone to use with your new prime membership!<br/><br/>Of course this does speak volumes as to the quality of this device.<br/><br/>I would almost re-purchase this phone, if they were to ever integrate the googleplay store I definitely would snag this up!  However I will raise from 2 stars to 3 for the amazing deal this phone is now!
I got this phone as soon as it came out on the July 25. I was SO excited... Then I returned it on July 30. It was heavy, Spotify (which I use a lot) froze the phone quite often, and the battery life was terrible. I REALLY wanted to like this phone. The carousel was *almost good, but you can't pin what you want there, so I almost always ended up just scrolling through all my apps to open the apps I used the most. Depending on the positioning of my hand, sometimes when I tried to unlock it, the screen would flash on for a second, and then immediately turn off. I guess you cover some of the cameras, it thinks it's still in your pocket, which is a cool idea, but if the screen flash happened too many times in a row, for some reason the lock screen would change by it's self AND the setting would change to the "rotate everyday" option.<br/><br/>Firefly worked really well on songs and video... but not anything else. The only thing I really miss from this phone is the dedicated camera button. I also take a lot of pictures, and I absolutely couldn't stand the fact that the only camera options I had were turning the flash on and off and and HDR mode which was awful. There were no white balance, exposure, or ISO controls at all. You couldn't even set different modes like nighttime, portrait, or macro. The photos were always either blown out due to exposure, or yellow due to AWB.<br/><br/>I guess you have to expect issues on the first iteration of a phone from ANY company. I bet a lot of the issues I was having will be addressed with a software update, but I didn't want to risk waiting and AT&T; only has a 14 day return policy. I exchanged for the HTC One M8 and I'm VERY satisfied with that phone.
UPDATE<br/>. I had an initial great reaction to the phone. Over the second day a few things became apparent. First, battery life is terrible. Totally atrocious. Maybe 5 hours and that's with light screen use ie no videos just browsing.<br/><br/>Once you start accumulating apps the phone becomes unwieldy. There is no way to organize the apps at all. They just stay where they lay in download order. There is no way to group them or search. When using the music app, which there are 2 of for no explainable reason, each time you enter a submenu and then return to the main artist/album/song menu it puts you allllll the way back at the start. Majorly annoying.<br/><br/>I will stand by the fact that the left and right tilt gestures are fantastic. The Dynamic Perspective is just Apple's Parallax. I think that might have been what was killing the battery but I have no way of knowing.<br/><br/>I exchanged it today for the LG G3 which was cheaper. Holy crap at the G3 screen!<br/><br/>Old Review<br/><br/>I have spent the last 24 hours using my Fire Phone. I came over from iOS and have experience with Android a as well.<br/><br/>Things I love:<br/><br/>The tilt controls are awesome!<br/>The screen looks fantastic.<br/>The camera works extremely well.<br/>Easy access to all of my Amazon content.<br/>Call clarity surpasses my iPhone.<br/>Firefly is great. I used it in Target and found to my surprise I had been overpaying on amazon. Probably not what they expected!<br/>Tilt to X-Ray in the Kindle app is amazing.<br/><br/>Some Next Steps<br/>The phone desperately needs lock screen music controls.<br/><br/>When going through my music library and selecting an album or artist and then hopping back to the main library it puts you all the way back at the beginning. This needs to be fixed.<br/><br/>The "3D" effect is meh but the controls that result from it are great as I started previously.<br/><br/>The app store is growing. I had no problem finding all the apps I use on iOS though.<br/><br/>A way to create folders and sorting options for apps on grid view. If it's there I can't find it.<br/><br/>My home has two wireless routers that share the same network name. My iPhone seamlessly passed off to which ever one had the strongest signal. That doesn't seem to be the case here.<br/><br/>OVERALL<br/>I think for the first phone the Fire is fantastic. I like new technology and this phone is fun to use and works exceedingly well.<br/><br/>My hope is that Amazon will support the device and OS well and hit some of the "next steps" I listed above.
So I have had my Fire Phone for a couple weeks now and this is what I have noticed so far. (Note, I am a former iPhone user, and since iPhones are the only smart phone I have used in the past, I am coming in with a different perspective than many former Google ecosystem users.)<br/><br/>Price: Edit... I bought the phone at full price from the AT&T; store and sent an email to Amazon with my concerns on the price drop. Amazon, with no questions asked, applied a credit to my Amazon account for the difference. They stated that since I bought it from AT&T; they could not refund the money, which implies that you can get the difference refunded if you purchased it from Amazon. My husband and I buy a lot of things through Amazon so a credit is just as good as a refund for us!!! Now I can say the price is amazing!! $0.99 for a fantastic phone and a year of prime? Who wouldn't buy this!!<br/><br/>Battery Life: The first few days I had the phone I played with it non-stop and it still took most the day to lose its charge. Now that I am back to normal use, I have noticed that the battery lasts the same amount of time that my iPhone battery would; maybe a little longer (I can go a 1 ½ - 2 days without charging). The only time I notice that the battery drains faster is when I go off of WiFi and onto the 4G network. The Bluetooth and navigation are also MAJOR battery drains. The one con I have is that my car does not charge the phone, or does not charge it fast enough so using the navigation long distance would be out of the question.<br/><br/>Amazon App Store: As stated already, I have never used an Android phone before so I am not familiar with Google apps. Coming from Apple, I knew going into this that there would be limited apps available to me on any Android market. Apple has a far better app store than any Android phone, but this is because iPhones are the most popular phones on the market. I realize that as Amazons app store becomes more popular and companies realize there is a need to make a version for Amazon, that there will be more available. I read a lot of reviews blaming Amazon for their app store, but it is not Amazon that produces the app. They are the new kids on the block so to speak, so eventually companies will catch up with an app version for the Fire Phone as they see a large enough need. So far I have only found two apps that are not available to me that I am used to using.<br/><br/>Interface and use: I love that this phone is so different than anything on the market right now! The dynamic perspective is cool, but more than that, for the first time in 6 years I actually feel like I have a new phone! Everything about the iPhone pretty much stays the same, it might get dressed up a little different but basically it hasn't changed much. It took me a few days (and a couple calls to Mayday) to get the hang of the phone. I still try to use the Fire Phone like my old phone, but I am slowly breaking away from it. One con about the way the cameras on the front work (for tracking your facial movements) isn't conducive to using a screen protector. When I put it on, it would have troubles opening to my lock screen and didn't work as smooth; it was fine after I took it off. So my next call to Mayday will be to inquire about that. For Kindle Fire users, you can have your home screen scroll similar to the Kindle or it can be set up more similar to the iPhones home screen with folders. FireFly is a tribute to the wonders of capitalism, but damn if it's not cool! It can detect almost anything. I am an IMDB junkie and when I am watching a movie or TV show it can detect what show I am watching and open it up in IMDB! It can also detect music, which is good for me because I can never remember band names. Also, whenever I am out and about and see a book I am interested in I use FireFly to price check it and also keep a history of the books I want to buy (or rent if they are part of the lending library!). I don't like that there is not a way to turn off push notifications for my email, but it doesn't seem to drain the battery too much and sound notifications can be turned off.<br/><br/>Camera and Audio: The camera on this is amazing, at least when compared to the iPhone. The iPhones forward facing camera is really grainy unless the light is perfect. The Fire Phones forward facing camera only gets grainy in really low light (which an iPhone wouldn't even be able to take a clear picture in).  The main camera takes great quality photos, far beyond what the iPhone was capable of. I am in love with all the editing tools too!!! You can do just about anything with it. There is the basics such as adjust lighting and HD quality, crop, smooth, color and shading effects that you expect to see now days. And then there are the other cool features! There are "stickers" that let you place and size things on a picture, useful things like an arrow and circle to point something out; less useful like mustaches and fezzes (try to guess which ones I like to use!). You can add text to a picture or actually make your picture into a meme. There is the ability to draw on the picture, whiten, take off blemishes, focus only one area, or color only some areas of a black and white photo. It is light years beyond anything Apple has ever put out (I would normally need an app for that). The sound for audio is clear and loud too; really loud! The ear phones that come with the phone are great as they never get tangled. The main wire is flat and doesn't knot, while the earbuds are magnetic so they don't twist around each other.<br/><br/>Again I am disappointed in Amazon for the price drop so soon, from a marketing perspective I understand why they did it; it just leaves a bad vibe for me spending $199 more than someone buying it today (And it is still a new phone for me!). The phone itself is superior to Apple and I am extremely happy with my purchase.
I am an Amazon Prime member and a prior owner of the Kindle Fire HD and HDX (both 7").<br/><br/>As far as smartphones are concerned, I was a BlackBerry user until the iPhone 4S came out and I switched to the Apple universe.  I later got an iPhone 5.  I sold that and briefly experimented with the Galaxy S4.  I could not adapt to the android platform, so I sold that and went with an iPhone 5C.<br/><br/>On the Friday after release, I decided to take the plunge and try the new Amazon Fire Phone.<br/><br/>I took it back the next day.<br/><br/>I wanted to love this phone.  The design physically was very appealing.  It felt very comfortable to hold, although it was a tad heavier than I expected.  Nevertheless, the gorilla glass on front and back certainly gave it a premium feel.<br/><br/>PROS<br/>1.  Premium feel compare to the cheaply made Samsung Galaxy phones and I loved the 4.7" display compare to my iph<br/>2.  Year of Amazon Prime for free is a GREAT deal<br/>3.  Stereo speakers on both ends sounded GREAT.<br/>4.  May Day feature worked GREAT.<br/>5.  App selection was surprisingly GOOD in spite of all of the negative views to the contrary.<br/>6.  Best email set up I have seen on a smartphone.  Loved the intergration.  Prefer this email over iPhone, Galaxy S4, or iPad.<br/>7.  Phone calls were crisp and clear.<br/>8.  Dynamic perspective was neat, but not a reason to switch if you use another smartphone.<br/><br/>CONS<br/>1.  Battery life was not good with heavy use.<br/>2.  Phone got VERY hot to the point it was uncomfortable to hold.<br/>3.  Fire fly wasn't dependable and now I have to seen back a case of toilet bowl cleaner that I didn't even know I ordered until I receive an email from Amazon saying it shipped, LOL.<br/>4.  Trouble getting text messages from iOS users, but this was more of an Apple holding my phone number hostage situation than anything else.<br/>5.  I couldn't make folders to organize my apps.<br/><br/>At the end of the day the thing I liked the most was the screen size. And since iPhone 6 will me at least as big, I decided that was the universe that I wanted to be in.<br/><br/>***UPDATE ON 14 AUG 14***<br/><br/>The inability to get text messages was the biggest reason that I took the phone back.  So when I found out that the problem was with Apple holding my phone number hostage via my iTunes account, I decided to give Fire Phone another chance.  I have been using my second Fire Phone for about a week now and I am  really enjoying it.  Still not sure if I will keep it or go with an iPhone 6 when it is released (I am heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, as well), but regardless of which direction I go, this is a quality device that is worthy of your consideration in the ever competitive smartphone arean.<br/><br/>I have downloaded the new update, but haven't seen much improvement on the mediocre battery life.  However, now you can make folders to organize your apps, which I love because I have tons and tons of apps and it is awesome to be able to organize them efficiently.  Double tapping the home button now allows you to view open apps and either switch from app to app seemlessly or close unwanted apps to save battery life.  This is similar to iPhone on this function.<br/><br/>For the record, if you look at the number of One Star Reviews, I hope that you will notice that most of these seem to have been written by Amazon haters who have never had a Fire Phone themselves and may have never even held one in person.  So I would encourage you to make sure that you are being influenced by actual Fire Phone owners rather than haters who are simply trying to be Fan Boys and push their Android/Google/Apple agendas.<br/><br/>FIRE PHONE ROCKS.
Overall, I love this phone.  I could go on and on about the positives (camera, cloud storage, seamless integration of my Amazon apps, and the motion features), but I think the 4-star rating takes care of that.  So...let's talk about the cons and whether they are cons you (or more appropriately, I) can live with.<br/><br/>Phone cost: A bit steep according to my non-Prime husband.  According to me, as a current Prime subscriber, not so much.  For me, the phone basically has a $100 rebate that is applied to my Prime subscription.<br/><br/>Battery life/heat:  I turned Dynamic Perspective off and dramatically increased my battery life, while decreasing the heat.  The tilt function is not accessible with DP off, but I can still use motion controls to see my notifications and the side menus.  If the DP feature was a reason why you bought the phone, this isn't a solution that you will like.<br/><br/>Limited app store: I have almost 450 apps in my cloud drive, but  only use about 20 of them on a regular basis, so this isn't a problem for me.  If you need certain apps for work, I would do a quick search for them in the app store before committing to this phone.<br/><br/>No micro SD slot:  For people invested in the Amazon ecosystem, this is unnecessary.  Books, Audiobooks, Music, Movies, Apps, and Docs are held for free in the cloud.  Photos taken with the Fire phone are also held in the cloud at no additional cost.  Before anyone complains about Amazon trying to force you to stay in their ecosystem, please remember that everyone does this and call out Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Blackberry as well.<br/><br/>Things I've already given Amazon feedback on:<br/><br/>1. Collections for Apps on the device (already addressed in software update)<br/>2. Amazon Music and Prime Music in one app - I had this on my old Android phone, not sure why I wouldn't have it on My Fire phone<br/>3. Ability to set silent time (i.e. Monday - Friday, 8am - 5 pm)<br/>4. Uploading contacts to the cloud
I wanted to like the phone, but it's a frustrating experience trying to operate a phone with so many background processes that it doesn't manage basic functions properly.  The Audible App, owned by Amazon, keeps crashing my phone.  I'm not sure how that's possible, probably a software conflict with the other Amazon sub processes running.  Many times when I try to answer the phone, i get the stupid tilt screen.  You can't answer the phone until you properly tilt the phone to get to the phone app.  The obvious 'home' button press does nothing.  By the time you properly tilt the phone, you lost the call.<br/><br/>Settings, I set the phone to auto dim, but it seems that the phone sometimes decides to not auto dim and you can't anything outside sometimes.  When it works correctly, it's awesome, otherwise, it's unusable.<br/><br/>Kindle app is great, you can read on a large, clear screen, and you can listen to the reader within the app.  It works flawlessly.<br/><br/>3D works most of the time, but sometimes it crashes and requires a reboot; not always convenient.<br/><br/>This is a phone i want to love, but I can't depend on it.  Conceptually it's awesome, problem is, it's still in beta and we're the beta testers.
DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!  Like many, I was very excited about this new piece of technology and the amazing new features it promised.  Having been a loyal amazon customer for years, I decided to take the leap.  I hit the rocky bottom hard with this expensive piece of crap.  The first two weeks with the phone were great and then everything started to go horribly wrong.  Amazon had to send me a brand new phone within the first month of ownership and the replacement, honestly, is barely better than the broken one.  When I went to the AT&T; store to activate the replacement phone, the first time we turned it on, it got stuck on the settings screen and would only allow me to exit to the emergency call screen.  I then had to start the phone again and when I attempted to restore the phone, it rejected the wi-fi network I wanted to use.  So I tried again.  When everything was done, all of my apps were there, but none of my downloaded content was present, my photos were gone, my texts were erased, and my contacts were lost, despite the company's promise that these things would be present after a backup (which I did manually this morning).  When I finally got the second phone home again, I went through the restore process again, only to find that the first one was not an error and, in fact, my texts, photos, and contacts are gone.  This phone has literally reduced me to tears of frustration because I cannot foresee things getting better and I now have to manually input everything that I was promised would be there.<br/>I understand the desire to compete with Apple in this market, but Amazon has released this phone WELL before it was ready, giving us a free year of Amazon Prime instead of a phone that works.  I have an incredibly long seventeen more months before I can ditch this piece of utter and complete s**t and go back to my iPhone, which may not be the best thing ever, but at least it worked reliably.
This is not a smart phone, sort to speak, it is an extortion, I use my phone for 4 basic functions; phone calls, texting, email and media (music, photos, and videos) that is it I can care less about the 1000's of apps that does nothing for me.  So here it is a nice sleek design with great dynamic perspective and that is about it.  You can take some great pictures but once you move them to a computer and remove them from the phone to get space back you can not put them back on (no drag and drop functions).  You must use the cloud service.<br/><br/>When I got the phone I also purchased a protective case with it and the case interfered with the voice piece so people  did not understand what I was saying.  Amazon said remove the case, WHAT now I have an expensive sleek piece of crap that is unprotected and it was a "Amazon Case" for the phone..  I was told that an update would fix the problem, and to put the case back on when the update was completed, did that now the phone is slower then a snail and the touch functions are non existent.  But there are bigger problems.<br/><br/>I installed the Amazon Music application to my computer and got all 11480 of the music imported with no issues, created a playlist and wanted to just simply sync the playlist music to the fire phone.  Well that cannot be done, you basically have two options 1, upload 250 songs at a time to the Amazon cloud, (about 2 hours) then download the songs to the phone (about 3 hours) then delete the files from the cloud and start the process over again.  or 2. pay Amazon 24.99 for 250,000 songs a year and run into larger upload and download times, even if you have the space on your computer and phone to store the files.<br/><br/>WTF you can not drag and drop simple music files to a phone that is directly connected to a computer?  This is programing 101.  When I contacted Amazon via chat to see if there was something I was doing wrong (which I know I was not) I basically was told that I have no choice but to use the cloud service.  I even offered several times to fix the issues for them.  Now Amazon did refund me the 24.99+ tax (and I will advise all of you that do purchase this phone to do the same fight them tooth and nail because this is crazy, stupid and just plan insulting).  Over the course of several hours I was transferred a great deal of customer service people who did not even know how to spell fire phone before I got to the refund.  The chat text is below.  Once I was done with the chat Amazon had someone call me which was yet another 2 hours.  You can see in the text that I was really trying to help. But I have come to the understanding that Amazon has NO intentions of adding this simple drag and drop function.  They only what to nickel and dime you.<br/><br/>If you want to put your files on the cloud and have no issues with it then great, however if you are a computer person like me who knows that no one really knows what the cloud is and does and you not want to share your information, or store your data somewhere in the world then DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE.  That is all I got to say other then I am going to return it and get a different phone, because AT&T; rates are much better then Verizon's.<br/><br/>The text message below has been edited only because I have changed my phone number from the messages other then that it is what happened.  It is unbelievable....It is almost comical... Here it is.<br/><br/>Text Messages:<br/><br/>You are now connected to Jitender from Amazon.com<br/>Me: Hello I have created a play list in Amazon Music on my computer, and would like to sync that play list to my Fire phone how do I do that ?‎6‎:‎26‎:‎13‎ ‎AM<br/>Jitender: Hello, my name is Jitender.

I am a computer expert I specialize in DR and Business Continuity the cloud is not mature enough to give me confidence that my paid for music Is safe. I am sure it is more secure if I pay Amazon more money for music I already paid for. But why would I pay more When I have the space to store it on my computer. The syncing of music is a no brainer and it seems to me that Amazon is nickel and diming their loyal customer. But the cloud is something that most people do not clearly understand the risks.

I have always been so greatful to amazon for the pricing and the convenience they have offered me in the last few years. Been prime member ever since it existed. After thousands of dollars in purchases in the last so many years this is the first time (I think) I bought a product actually manufactured by amazon and it saddens me that I had to return it..<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-One year of free prime membership.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/> Too many useless gimmicks<br/> -dynamic perspective is just a useless gimmick and I don't even think if amazon ever tested this for optimal power consumption.<br/><br/> Battery<br/> -battery died within 6 hours.. no gps, no blutooth, no wifi,  barely spoke to somebody for less than a minute and that was it.. Battery at 2%.<br/> - May be this should be a one of the pros. The phone gets so hot for no reason.. I live in wisconsin there is only so much heat we can take, like everyone else around here I complain when it's over 75 degrees outside.<br/><br/>Apps<br/><br/>- some of the very popular apps on google play aren't available.<br/><br/>Maps and Nav<br/><br/>- amazon has their own maps going on..this could be just me.. I don't have a good feeling about this.. We have learned from experiences with apple.. You just can't trust anyone else other than google with the maps.<br/><br/>Camera<br/><br/>- camera is average and takes pictures while in your pocket. I could never figure out how to disable this feature/annoyance.<br/><br/>Build<br/>- phone is built well but I think this is still too heavy.<br/>- SIM card tray is annoying. You need a tool to get your SIM card out.. Really..!<br/>- irreplaceable battery.<br/><br/>Blutooth<br/><br/>Asks permission to connect every time it tries to pair with the Audi MMI.. This could be audi.. But I never had this issue with any of my other phones..<br/><br/>Overall<br/><br/>- overpriced for what it's worth
7/25/14 I love Amazon products. I buy every one as soon as it comes out. That being said, my Fire phone is going back to the store. It's a beautiful phone just doesn't do what I need it to. I've had it less than 24hrs and so far heres my issues:<br/>1) no emojis. What the heck.<br/>2) my phone is hot to the touch and I'm not even running anything like gps.<br/>3) it's not compatible with most of the apps I use daily. Beneficial bank, discover card, craftsy, retail me not, cartwheels by target to name a few<br/>4) the battery life is terrible. I unpluged it like an hr ago and its on 61%  I have to figure out if there is a way to close apps when I'm done using them.<br/>I think I'll give Amazon a year or two to fix this phone and get with the program and then get it again. :( this is the first time I've ever been unsatisfied with them.<br/><br/>Update 7/28/14: Ok it's now been a few days and it seems like the battery thing is no longer an issue. The phone is still warm to the touch to me. And I'm finding more and more apps that I use on a daily basis don't work on this phone. Latest one. Runtastic. And since this is one I pay for, it really bothers me not to have access to it. Also Progressive (auto insurance), Dunkin donuts, JW Library, Septa are not compatible with this phone.<br/>There should be some way to group these apps in to categories or something. Because they are all just sitting there in the order you downloaded them and that's not going to work if you use a lot like I do.<br/>Also WHY IS THERE NO OTTER BOX CASE FOR THIS PHONE?!?! I only do otterbox cause I dropped my phone off a moving train once (I'm a locomotive engineer) and the phone didn't break. That's how I test them. Lol.<br/>I need this phone to have some kind of "do not disturb" feature. On my I phone I could hit this feature and only the people in my favorites could get through but every thing else was silenced except the alarms so up could put this on at night and not be bothered with any one. I need this phone to have something like that.
I think a lot of the negative reviews are coming from people that never had a kindle fire before. So if you're not familiar with the amazon app store and the kindle fire maybe it's best to steer clear of the fire phone. If you are familiar,  it's an amazing phone. I use all of amazon's streaming services so having all my music, tv, movies and books in my pocket at all times is worth the money alone.<br/><br/>The phone itself is great, I've only used iphones before so I don't know how much I can compare. In my opinion though the speakers and display are just as good if not better than an iphone. Some of the gimmicks the phone has are less than impressive, although full warning I'm also a nintendo fanboy so I'm used to my electronics having useless gimmicks. There's not much application for dynamic perspective and firefly is inconsistent. When firefly works though it's amazing, for example I went through my fridge and firefly instantly identified all of the condiments in my fridge. I took firefly to a craft store and it failed to identify almost everything in the store even though everything I tried was sold by amazon. It does better with music and it's pretty consistent about pulling phone numbers off of business cards or takeout menus. So there are issues but they're just software issues. The flick/tilt takes a bit of getting used to but it seems to work fine.<br/><br/>Also a lot of people are mentioning battery life as an issue. My battery seems to last an average of 3-4 days if I'm just using it as a phone, and about 8 hours if I'm streaming or playing games. Both of those are rough estimates but neither is even close to as bad as some people are claiming and the phone has never gotten hot.
I am a long-time Amazon fan, and own most of their previous hardware (Kindle (most versions), Fire HDX, Fire TV). With that thought, I decided to try the first iteration of the Fire phone. I returned the phone today. Here's why:<br/><br/>1. Very short battery life. I had a 100% charge at 6 am this morning. By 9 am, it was below 90% -- and I hadn't even used it!<br/>2. Reception isn't as good as with other smart phones. The signal strength is lower for Fire than for previous phones -- in the same areas.<br/>3. I cannot link the contacts on the Fire phone with my Ford Sync -- so no hands-free dialing from the car's built-in system. (I decided to not trade in the car to find one that would work with this phone.)<br/>4. I can send text messages to the wife and she receives them, but I don't receive hers. After conferring with MayDay and doing what they requested, we still couldn't get it to work.<br/>5. Sound quality on the speakerphone option is very poor. I can barely hear the person on the other end of the line, even with the volume at maximum.<br/><br/>I may come back for a Fire in another iteration or so, but would not recommend this phone.
I love this phone!  It is now a known issue that using glass screen protectors would cause the phone to over heat while supposedly idle.  When electronics get too hot bad things happen, such as components starting to malfunction followed swiftly by the device not working properly.  Since I did not cover the sensors and I got a case built for the phone, it is no surprise I haven't had any issues with the phone being too hot or being slow.  I have used many smart phones and this is so far my favorite phone, it's everything I need from a phone and more!
I'm done with Apple.  I wanted a change.  I'm loving this phone.  The camera is great.  So much storage.  Easy to maneuver.  Very user friendly.  Fast.  I found all my apps that I had on my iphone on the fire.  People will complain about anything.  Take all negative reviews with a grain of salt.
I REALLY want to like the Fire Phone, but I can't. In my opinion, Amazon really struck out with their initial foray into the smartphone market.<br/><br/>For what its worth, I am fully baked into the Amazon ecosystem. I own a Kindle Fire HDX, Kindle Paperwhite and a Fire TV. I subscribe to Amazon Prime, use Amazon's Cloud Drive to save photos and subscribe to Amazon Music where I imported my digital music collection for cloud based storage. And now I am the owner of a new Fire Phone. So this review is from someone who has intertwined himself with Amazon's services and technology.<br/><br/>While each Amazon device (Kindle Fire, Kindle Paperwhite, and Fire TV) has its unique quirks and technical limitations compared to their competitors, I have been very please with all of my hardware purchases from Amazon - UNTIL NOW! Granted, I have not used my new Fire Phone long, but it didn't take long to realize it is not ready to be my everyday companion. There seems to still be bugs in the system and the Fire Phone's user interface, built on Fire OS 3.5, is clunky at best, a piecemealed afterthought at worst.<br/><br/>And regarding the hardware, why is no one talking about how warm the back of the phone gets after just a few minutes of general use. Regardless if I am playing around with the Firefly feature, listening to music, or using an app, the Fire phone gets physically hot to the point that it is VERY concerning.<br/><br/>Is anyone else noticing their Fire Phone getting hot under normal use?<br/><br/>And the craziest part was the unreliability of the Firefly feature to correctly identify products. See my attached customer pictures to get a quick glimpse of what my Fire Phone couldn't recognize like a Fire TV box and a Kindle HDX Origami Cover package. HOW IN THE WORLD DOES FIREFLY NOT RECOGNIZE A FIRE TV PACKAGE?<br/><br/>While I believe the future may be bright for the Fire Phone, I am not sure if being an early adopter and locking into a long-term wireless contract with AT&T; is worth the incremental benefits and short-lived cool factor of owning it. The phone overheating during normal use is also a big concern, especially since the battery is not removable. I love my other Amazon devices, but the Fire Phone not only leaves me with a sense of wanting, it leaves me with a sense of regret.<br/><br/>------- DETAILED REVIEW BELOW -------<br/><br/>*** HARDWARE ***<br/><br/>The Fire Phone is powered by a 2.2 GHz Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 CPU and Adreno 330 GPU with 2GB of RAM. That's nothing to laugh at, but also nothing to write home about either. It has a 4.7" 315 ppi display  which is large enough to use comfortably without feeling like you're holding a phablet. The Fire Phone has a really nice 13 MP rear-facing camera with image stabilization that's capable of recording 1080p high resolution videos too. And the front-facing 2.1 MP camera is more than adequate for Skype calling or taking the occasional,  shameless selfie.<br/><br/>While none of the hardware specifications and performance blow me out of the water, they also don't seem to command the price point set for the Fire Phone or make some new customers willing to switch cell phones on performance alone. For what it's worth, my last phone was a Samsung Galaxy S4 running Android 4.4.2, Kit Kat.<br/><br/>I'm not going to belabor the technical specifications and differences of the Fire Phone compared to its competitive set like the Apple iPhone 5S, Samsung Galaxy S5, and HTC One. However, I will focus on the differentiating aspects of the Fire Phone touted by Amazon as game changing features that set the Fire Phone apart and justify its high price tag. Those are Dynamic Perspective, Gestures, Firefly, and Mayday.<br/><br/>*** DYNAMIC PERSPECTIVE ***<br/><br/>Dynamic Perspective is the Fire Phone's parlor trick to get people saying "ooh" and "ahh" while Amazon adds another toy to their lineup to pull customers further into their ecosystem.<br/><br/>At the time of writing this review, I am realizing that there are only a handful of apps and games that take full advantage of the Dynamic Perspective feature. Essentially, the coolest thing I can do with Dynamic Perspective is watch the home screen, play with the icons and status bar, use the map application, and play a few games where the feature wasn't a complete afterthought.<br/><br/>Amazon may provide great incentives for developers to create new games or  recode current games to take advantage of Dynamic Perspective, but that has yet to be seen. Personally, I would love to play Angry Birds, Cut the Rope, Subway Surfer, Temple Run, etc with Dynamic Perspective. But until the development community makes a collective effort to join Amazon in making Dynamic Perspective the next big thing in gaming, the likelihood of this technology quickly catching on in mainstream is slim.<br/><br/>Also, to save you battery and for when you get bored with the 3D effects, there is a setting in the phone that allows a user to turn off the Dynamic Perspective. I keep mine turned on for now, but can understand why someone would want to keep it turned off to conserve the battery or to keep the quirky "peek" feature from flashing hidden items on and off.<br/><br/>*** GESTURES ***<br/><br/>Along with Dynamic Perspective head tracking, the Fire Phone offers one-handed usability features through wrist flicks and tilting gestures. However, I am finding the learning curve to be steep and many inconsistencies with making gestures work. Many times, I would have to over exaggerate when flicking my wrist or tilting the phone  to get the desired response on the screen. But other times when I was using my natural motion, the phone processed it as a gesture and presented actions on the screen! Nothing critical, but just a buggy annoyance. It is highly likely that this will be fixed/fine tuned with the next software release.<br/><br/>*** FIREFLY ***<br/><br/>To test the Firefly feature, I lined up 15 products for the Fire Phone to recognize and take me to the Amazon product detail page. Of the ten items I tried to scan, Firefly only recognized 3 of them correctly. I kept getting an error message saying the server was unavailable or the product couldn't be recognized. The Fire Phone couldn't even recognize the box that my Fire TV came in (see the picture I uploaded with this review)<br/><br/>Built on A9's Flow application, Amazon really missed the boat in getting Firefly absolutely perfect. The small ticket, grocery items that Firefly did recognized didn't seem conducive to impulse buying like the bigger ticket consumer electronic products that it didn't correctly recognize. And I am more inclined to want to comparison shop with Firefly at a big box electronics store versus the grocery store.<br/><br/>*** MAYDAY ***<br/><br/>One thing that I miss while using the Fire Phone is having an electronic assistant in my pocket. Like iOS's Siri or Android's Google Now, Amazon is missing that **accurate** personal assistant that answers your questions, reminds you about appointments, and keeps you productive by predicting what you need before you need it (ala Google Now). Amazon's voice assistant is rudimentary in my opinion as it can mainly do basic tasks like make phone calls, send text messages, send emails, and search the web.<br/><br/>The Mayday feature is nice for the initial setup and first few days while learning how to use your new phone, but I can't see a huge need for it after the initial learning curve. Granted, the few times I have used the Mayday button on the Fire Phone or my Kindle Fire HDX, the customer service rep was fast to respond, polite, and gave excellent service. However, I have had my Fire HDX for months and have only used it three times. Now if Amazon could fix AT&T; specific issues through the Mayday feature, this feature may be worth it's weight in gold.<br/><br/>*** WHAT'S MISSING ***<br/><br/>- An Full Function Digital Assistant like Siri, Google Now, S Voice, etc.<br/>- Google Play Market (although some apps and games may be side loaded if you want)<br/>- Removable Battery (I have a feeling the 1st generation of Fire Phones will have battery issues due to how warm the phone gets during continuous use)<br/>- Bluetooth 4.0 (useful in connecting to latest generation wearables)<br/>- External Storage / microSD Card Slot<br/>- Multi-Mic Noise Cancellation (trust me, this is important for all cell phones)<br/>- Infrared & DLNA Connectivity (nice to have but not critical)<br/><br/>*** THE BOTTOM LINE ***<br/><br/>In my opinion, the customer who would get the most value out of the Fire Phone is someone who:<br/><br/>- Does not already own a Kindle Fire tablet<br/>- Is not already an Amazon Prime subscriber (1 year free is a nice purchase bonus)<br/>- At a point in their wireless contract that they want to upgrade their phone (don't break your contract for this phone)<br/>- Doesn't mind being tied to AT&T; for wireless coverage<br/>- Not technically savvy and would benefit from the Mayday feature long-term<br/>- Owns or plans to buy a Fire TV so that the Fire Phone can act as a second screen<br/>- Takes a ton of photos with your cellphone and would benefit from free cloud storage<br/>- Likes shiny, new toys regardless of the practical functionality<br/><br/>I accept that being an early adopter for consumer electronics also means I play the role of a public beta tester to prove concept, demand, and functionality. As such, I don't want to explicitly discourage anyone from trying the Fire Phone as it can only get better with updates and future releases. But I can't recommend the Fire Phone as it is right now. Unfortunately, there are too many competitor products that are a better value for the price and features. And I am seriously concerned with how warm the phone gets and the unreliability of Firefly to recognize products.<br/><br/>Overall, the Fire Phone gets 2 out of 5 stars from me.
First, let me disclose my bias.  I LOVE Amazon and almost all of its products and services.  I am a Prime Member; I get my books on Audible and Kindle, etc.  Perhaps it was my appreciation for most things Amazon that caused my great disappointment with the Fire phone.  I returned it today - having had it less than a week.  The 3D and Firefly bells and whistles are gimmicky.  The apps I use most were not available on Amazon's app store.  The phone gets blazing hot to the touch (oh, maybe that is where "Fire" comes from).  To turn off the ringer, you have to go through a minimum of 4 steps (swipes).  The audio (not using headphones) is tinny and reminiscent of phones from the 1990s.  It is a beautiful looking phone, but for this price, I want something that is both beautiful and functional, such as an iPhone.  Happy to try it again in the second or third generation.
Having a windows tablet, I purchased a windows phone.  The phone was wonderful but the service just failed too often.  After reviewing the Amazon Fire phone I decided to not go back to a Windows phone and I am pleased with this decision.  I think the Amazon Fire phone is a hybrid, merging the cons of the windows phone with those of the android.  The one missing link is Google.  If you are a huge Google fan, and the chrome browser is a must have, then I would recommend either giving this a try or going with another android phone all together.  I love Google, and I can say Amazon provides a wonderful selection of apps and has an excellent browser; I am very pleased with this phone - it is equally compatible to Google's Chrome and app selection.<br/><br/>Having switched to a windows tablet (RT) I moved over to Outlook – which I think is a superior email provide. With the outlook client app on the Amazon Fire phone I can easily access my Microsoft office suite and outlook email.<br/><br/>The service provider is AT&T; and the reception is excellent!  No missed calls, no missed text messages, and clear sound on all my phone calls.<br/><br/>Visually, the Windows home screen was nicer, but I have to say the functionality of this Fire phone makes up for what it might be missing in the visual design of the home screen.  But the overall design of the fire phone is nicer than the windows phone I had.  It is sleek, feels solid in my hand but not heavy – it’s a beautiful phone.<br/><br/>Amazon service is absolutely amazing.  This phone was remarkably easy to activate!!  I was amazed at the ease, the quickness and the thoroughness of Amazon.  Before I received the phone everything was handled - even transferring my old phone number.  The only reason I needed to reach out to AT&T; was due to an error on my part in providing access information to my previous provider.  But within moments my phone was switched to my old phone number.<br/><br/>I haven’t tried the camera yet, so I cannot review this part yet.  Firefly is awesome!!  Held the phone up to the television and within moments it identified the movie we were watching!!<br/><br/>I love the phone, the service is great: I rate it 5 stars.
I only write this five-star review to balance out some of the stupid one-star reviews that people have been posting in the past few days. You are discouraging people from buying this phone solely because Amazon uses electricity from fossil fuels to power their servers that make up their cloud, right? So, you must all be driving Nissan Leaves and charging them from your house that runs completely off solar and wind and hydro, right? Because we all have access to that kind of energy, correct? Oh wait, no we don't, and I'm willing to bet you are using non-renewable energy sources all the time without thinking about it. It would be great if all our energy was renewable and cheap, but there is no free lunch to be found, guys. If Google and Apple power their cloud servers using solar or tidal or wind farms (probably wind farms, considering where they are located), you can bet they pay more for that energy and pass the cost on to their customers in some form or another. That's what businesses do. So are you willing to pay much more for your energy? Are you willing to pay more for everything you buy? Are you willing to drive electric cars and never ever fly? Are you willing to pay more than the low asking price for this phone? If not, STFU and quit being a hypocrite.
I recently upgraded to the fire after my 4s finally gave out on me. I've been a prime user for a few years now, so was interested in giving the fire a chance.<br/><br/>Pros: best 1 handed operation of any phone I've used. All of the phones features are available with one handed motions and gestures. This is a big pro for me. Firefly is a time saver for comparison shopping. Music, video, book, messaging, and calendar apps are all well integrated, pretty, and has all features I want. Built-in apps are all great.<br/><br/>Cons: while most of the apps I used on ios are available here, there are a few notable gaps. There is a shortage of running/fitness apps for example (I imagine apps that don't make sense on the fire tablets are slower in coming to the Amazon store). Also, apps don't update as quickly as the Google play versions. In addition, notifications from third party apps are inconsistent. Last, I miss a full featured voice assistant. For many people this may not be so big deal at all<br/><br/>Overall, I'm very happy with the phone and would recommend buying it. Particularly if you tend to rely on built in apps, are a prime user, and like 1 handed operation. The OS is the strong suit  I think my complaints will all be fixed in future updates.
Had been watching the Fire and waited for the iPhone 6 release. Given the pricing of the new iPhones, I opted for the Fire Phone for myself and my son. I have not been disappointed after having the iPhone 3 and iPhone 4s. I've had the phone for a week now, and as I learn to use the phone I am more impressed every day. After reading the previous reviews and being an iPhone user for so long, I knew I would have to be patient learning how to use a new operating system. What hit home for me was the ease of use for my 11 year old, the Fire being his first smartphone. The first few days I found myself asking him, "How did you do that?"<br/><br/>I was a bit nervous about the battery life and overheating. Battery drain was high and phone seem to run hot for the first few days, but that has completely subsided after I figured out how to close apps after using them. I use the phone for personal use and work purposes and several email accounts set up through the phone. I live off my calendar for both work and home and have had no issues with calendaring.<br/><br/>My favorite features:<br/>  1. While in email, flicking the phone to the left and having attachments from your inbox show up. This saves me from having to search for the email then clicking on the attachment.<br/>  2. Each email account has a different color code, so I can quickly determine if an email is work or personal.<br/>  3. Twisting of the wrist to get to a well laid out summary/settings page. This page gets quick access to airplane mode, wi-fi, bluetooth, flashlight, settings, mayday, search and screen brightness while at the same time giving you a quick status of your most recent notifications from phone calls, e-mail, messages, and apps.<br/>  4. Flicking the phone to the right and getting quick access to the App store, photos and more.<br/>  5. The Apps that I use most frequently look better, have added features and easier navigation than the iPhone version. I was completely surprised that would happen. After using an iPhone for so long, I had to be patient to figure out the nuances in the apps. I can see where iPhone users may think the app doesn't work as well because it works DIFFERENTLY. With that said, the only issue I have had with the phone is that my Facebook app was glitchy. Called Mayday (super easy and helpful) and they suggested I delete the app and reinstall. Worked like a charm and haven't had any issues since.<br/>  6.  I like the feel of the phone. The curve on the bottom edge of the phone makes it easy to grip and it doesn't feel like it is going to slip out of my hands like I felt with the iPhone.<br/><br/>I'm very happy with my Fire phone and glad Amazon took the giant leap into the market!
**Changed 6 Oct 2014<br/><br/>There's nothing I can really add outside the other poor reviews. I really wanted to like this phone and bought it on release day without a contract. Lesson learned, don't buy on release day and even worse, Amazon dropped the price $200 since I bought it. Great.<br/><br/>**4 days after writing this review, Amazon refunded the $200 price difference, very happy.  Before considering the rest of my review, when priced at $450 I do feel that this phone has a lot more value...it drops it from competition with the iPhone and other high end smart phones.  At this price range, it is what I would expect and I modified my stars from 2 to 4 due to the better value.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Dynamic Perspective is fun, though feels gimmicky<br/>-Phone controls are decent, I like the bottom swipe for back and have found it intuitive.<br/>-Screen looks good and the size is perfect for one handed use.<br/>-Camera is great<br/>-Amazon photo cloud is a nice addition<br/>-Year of prime (though I'd be willing to pay $99 for another year if I could return this phone!)<br/>-As I said above, the phone being $450 ($350 if you consider prime) this is a good value...now, not @ $650<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Gets very hot, even when I'm not using it.<br/>-Battery life is abhorrent...I average maybe 12 hrs before it has to be plugged in.<br/>-No google app store...I thought I could live without it and that surely a lot of apps will be ported over to the amazon store.... 2 months in and the answer is NOPE!<br/>-Phone routinely freezes and needs to be restarted at least once a day.<br/>-Doesn't play any video if it's been on too long...i.e., more than 18 hrs or so.<br/>-The auto screen brightness is a joke...the darker the environment gets, the brighter the screen gets. I have to manually adjust it when using it in a dark area.<br/><br/>Long of the short...I regret this purchase and I would return the phone if I could, but I can't...so I'm stuck with it until I save up enough to buy a new one. I may just succumb and get a new phone on contract, which is irritating since I outright bought this phone because I didn't want to be on a contract.  **I am happy with the purchase now, but I'm leaving the original content of my review.<br/><br/>Live and learn I guess...and pay more attention to pre-release reviews...which I ignored when buying this thinking that surely Amazon wouldn't sell a flawed product at such a premium price, and I have been using the original Kindles for years (I've had nearly every generation since release back on 0' something something.)  **Again, at $450/$350 this is a much better price/value.<br/><br/>**My original review says to not buy this phone, but with the price drop and getting the $200 back, I do feel that this is worth the money....the phone is exactly what I would expect from this range...now why they didn't price this way to start...who knows....probably would have gotten better reviews.
Original Review: 4 stars<br/>First, let's start with the positives. If you will use Amazon Prime for a year (worth $99), if you will use free unlimited cloud storage for phone photos (easily worth about $9/month), if you'll take advantage of MayDay (hard to estimate the value but maybe $50), and if you're an AT&T; customer or OK with becoming one then the Amazon Fire Phone is an incredible deal! It's a VERY GOOD VALUE. It works out to be better than free if you factor in all those bonuses. But you can only factor those in if they work for you. They work for me, so I feel like the phone was dirt cheap.<br/><br/>The actual phone is a sturdy piece of equipment. I particularly like the dedicated camera button. The camera button is great for people who like to take pix with their phone because it makes it super quick. And the cloud storage for photos is great because now I never have to worry about losing those pictures. I also like the screen display and the sound quality is good. The phone is attractive and pleasant to hold as well. I don't care too much about the 3D perspective thing and just think it's kind of cute. But I loaded a couple games that use it and my son just loves it, giggles nonstop when playing.<br/><br/>MayDay service: No other phone offers you immediate help from a REAL PERSON 24/7. I switched to an Amazon Fire Phone from an iPhone and one big reason why was because with a Fire phone I can get immediate help wherever I am (so long as the phone is working) but with an iPhone I had to make an appointment and visit a store in person. How much better is MayDay than going to the Apple store? SOOOOO MUCH BETTER. I have used MayDay twice so far and both times was very helpful. Real people answer and they are nice and helpful.<br/><br/>This phone has some serious negatives. But those were the same negatives every other smartphone had when it was first released: not enough apps, buggy software, etc. So I expect that to change. I expect future updates to improve the bugs and I expect more apps to be created for this phone. In particular, I'm hoping they soon change the bluetooth firmware: supposedly the phone has bluetooth 4.0 LE but the firmware doesn't support it yet - a future update should fix that.<br/><br/>I do hope they'd manage some sort of agreement with Google to allow android apps more easily (you can use some on the Fire phone but you have to install them on a PC and transfer them to your Fire phone). This is currently the biggest downside: not enough apps. Many very popular apps are not currently available on the Fire phone, but again I expect that to change quickly.<br/><br/>---<br/>Updated Review: 2 stars<br/>Again I will start with the positives... The thing still works. I can make and receive phone calls, texts, and I can take pictures and read email and facebook.<br/><br/>Negatives...<br/>Not enough apps. No Starbucks app, no app for either of my gyms, no app for MapMyRun, no app for Hulu, and many others. To make matters worse, some companies have explicitly said they do not intend to make an app for the Fire Phone OS because they don't feel it's worth it.<br/><br/>I turned off many of the so-called "features" of this phone because they were just so annoying. That 'tilt to scroll' thing is impossible to use. Forget it if you multitask and read various things at the same time. And the autocorrect? Don't get me started. It didn't even have the word autocorrect in its dictionary! The dictionary is puny.<br/><br/>Buggy and constant updates. Things keep changing and it's driving me crazy. They just update way too often IMO. Buggy stuff like the web browser is inconsistent. Sometimes I will save a page you looked at and other times it will bring back up an old page you had up before that one. It doesn't consistently open a new window from email and facebook links (sometimes it does and sometimes it doesnt). And sometimes the camera freezes or stalls.<br/><br/>One thing about this phone: if the battery runs so low it shuts off, then after you charge and reboot the phone, the first 5-10 minutes the phone will simply not work properly. It's super slow to warm up.<br/><br/>OK, so here's one thing that just annoys me: the MayDay staff are very friendly and try to be helpful but it's clear that they don't actually have Fire Phones to play with and learn from. They can't test any of their ideas out themselves or give any advice from personal experience. All they do is look up help manuals and they only ever do that after telling you to reboot (typical for tech help but I expected more).<br/><br/>I feel like I gave this phone a fair shot. Now I'm just so frustrated with it that I'm getting an iPhone instead.
So I've been carrying the Fire for a week now and have decided to give a review based on my initial feelings on the device. I may update as time goes on. The review will be broken into two parts. The first part will be for the standard user who just wants to open the box and use it. The second will be directed at the more tech savvy buyers. I won't go over all the specs, other reviewers and Amazon themselves have done a thorough job of that already. I will say for the price it doesn't stack favorably against other high end devices in its price category. Processor and RAM don't always equate to speed but in android based phones it generally does.<br/><br/>Out of the box impressions. It feels nice in the hand and the screen is a good size. A little worried about the back glass, I've seen many a back cracked on the iPhone 4 series. Feels a little heavier than other phones its size but I like a little heft in my phone so good for me.<br/><br/>The dynamic perspective is pretty cool. I'm not sure how much I will notice it over time but for the moment I'm continually impressed over how smoothly it works and transitions. There are few apps that take advantage of it but the few that do are fun. My daughter loves Monkey Buddy. She's constantly trying to steal my phone. It's also useful on certain apps like the map for getting a good birds eye view of where you're going. The one year free of Amazon Prime is super cool but it's almost necessary to use the phone to its maximum potential. So keep in mind after the first year you'll be paying 100 a year to fully utilize the phone. I had it anyway so just a 100 bonus for me. You are limited to the Amazon App Store for apps. There are ways around this but if you're a basic user you'll be missing quite a few apps from the Play Store. I'm also not a big fan of the silk browser. They should include chrome for those of us who switch phones and want to seamlessly bring over our bookmarks. The carousel that shows your most recently used apps is not as handy as I'd thought it would be. I've went to move to an app and after flipping for twenty seconds realized it would have been quicker to pull up all apps and find it. I wish the carousel was just programmable to your favorite apps.<br/><br/>I do like the left or right flick to pull up menus. I haven't pulled them up by accident too much. Once again I do wish they were programmable. There is also no way to shut off apps. This is a bit unforgivable for a newer smartphone.<br/><br/>Battery life also sucks. I feel turning off the apps would help but not there. I charge it at least once during the day.<br/><br/>Call clarity and volume have been excellent. Speakers for music and tv are only average. No native or Amazon app ringtone or text tone support. There are ways around this but I'll hit that later. Swiping up instead of a dedicated back button is neither good or bad, just different.<br/><br/>Firefly is cool. I've used it twice already to scan and call a number. Haven't used the music ID but I'm sure i will.<br/><br/>Can't get Mayday to work. Massively disappointed and no way to troubleshoot or fix it that I've seen. I just wanted to see if there was a way to turn off apps and see it in action. I've tried it at least once a day every day on and off WiFi. Sucks.<br/><br/>Voice control is just average. Not up to Siri.<br/><br/>For the more technologically capable. You can side load apps not in the Amazon App Store and the Fire allows the loading of third party apps. There is just a setting to turn on. An app called ES File Explorer will allow you to get the apk files from third party websites and move apps between folders on the phone. I was able to download zedge and get ringtones and text tones. It's worked perfectly on mine although a coworker has had mixed results. There have been several apps that I haven't been able to get the working version. The file explorer has allowed me to load and stream movies to my Roku no problems. I'm using Allcast Pro to stream. It costs but I used the free coins you get with the phone to get it for free. I hate the lack of an SD card slot. There are memory sticks with the microusb adapters that will work fine fairly cheap but I hate having to carry another piece of tech on me for something as basic as memory.<br/><br/>It's just an okay phone. A hundred dollars cheaper and it would be a decent buy but it is a little pricey. Hoping some other things will be fixed on future software updates. It's just an okay smartphone. Outside the dynamic display there is nothing new or exciting. Even the Prime integration is not really an improvement over the android versions of the app.<br/><br/>Update. There is a software update that allows users to pin apps to the carousel. Working on getting it. Still no pin for the right side flick but the fact this was added so quickly gives me hope. Still a three star though.
It seems all of the negative reviews center on renewable energy.  How dumb are you people???
I originally bought this phone after the $200 price drop. All I really knew at the time was that it had some cool features but wasn't selling very well. I figured that based on the hardware I'd be getting a high end device with all of the Amazon advantages for only about $350 (no contract) after I factored in the free year of Prime. A few weeks later, I've decided that I like it enough to write a review and maybe convince a few others to try this phone so you don't miss out.<br/><br/>This really is a very unique phone. The Firefly service is not nearly as bad as people have stated. I didn't expect it to recognize any and every item I picked up, but it does recognize a lot - from the Extra gum on my desk and soda cans in the break room to all kinds of books, movies and games. I've also seen reviews calling dynamic perspective "gimmicky", but I think its just plain cool and so do a lot of the people I show it to. Even the lock screen graphics are great and if you do buy one, my favorite is the one with the astronaut that lands on the moon until he's chased back to his ship by huge green tentacles.<br/><br/>There is no better device if you're going to shop Amazon, and I do all the time. Everything is seamless and integrated, including Fire TV. My phone connects when its on the same WiFi network and all the photos and videos are easily available to browse and watch on TV. There is even an app you can install that sends all your notifications through to the TV. Back to the subject of video, I've used it at work during events and even a going away party and it produced some great, high quality videos. I also have an HTC ONE M_8 and I admit that I love the phone overall, but the camera is pretty bad and doesn't hold a candle  to the one on Fire phone. I tried depositing checks by taking pictures and every time it would come back unrecognizable or unreadable. I tried multiple times and with two separate banks! I kept getting the same error messages from both bank's apps so I decided to give the Fire a try. My deposit was was accepted on the first try. I really noticed when I used it for pictures on a couple of hikes. The 13.1 megapixel camera deserves an A+.<br/><br/>The main shortfall is that there are fewer apps available and you don't have access to the Google Play store. This is probably the biggest drawback, but if you take some time to look you can find some great apps. And when Amazon puts out its free app bundle of the week (something close to that) they don't just give you .99 cent games. Several were really useful, well put together tools with price tags of $12-$15 dollars. Admittedly, there are some you will just have to do without for now. They don't have every bank, but you can easily bookmark it in your browser and access it that way. And they actually have quite a few of the ones I needed including Discover, Capital One and Chase. The one app you may miss the most is Starbucks, but 'eh ... really didn't take long to get over that either.<br/><br/>I'm out of time but overall I really like the phone and in grows on you in a short time when you see all it can do. If you're really into Amazon already with Prime, Fire TV or if you use their instant video service, then you will love this phone. Its a bargain right now so if your looking for cool new phone try the Fire. I work for a Telecom (not in Sales) and see a lot of phones, but this one is a surprise stand out. I liked it enough that I activated it on its own line and it's getting a lot use, even more than my M_8.
I've been using the Fire Phone since its release, and I've been completely satisfied with it; it's everything I hoped it would be. (I was happy with it even at the full price.  I'm even happier now that Amazon has refunded the $199.) Which is not to say that everybody will like it.<br/><br/>Since this is my first smart phone, I can't compare it to others. Previously, I never saw the need for one.  I had a ten-year old Nokia cell phone that I barely used; I kept it in the car most of the time, turned off, using only for an emergency.<br/>I do have a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 that I've been very happy with, but it's too big to lug around everywhere I go and there have been many times I wished I had it with me, especially after Amazon introduced Prime Music.  When the Fire Phone was introduced I saw it as a handy, pocket-sized version of the Kindle Fire tablet.  The price seemed a bit steep, but with the free year of Amazon Prime it thought it would be worth it.  Unlike many others, I have no problem with AT&T.;  I've had internet access with them for years, first DSL and then U-verse, and I was happy with the performance of both and found customer service (the few times I needed it) to be excellent. Plus, they have full coverage here in coastal San Diego.  The phone coverage is so good in my apartment that I'm considering getting rid of my land line.<br/><br/>The phone has performed flawlessly since the day I turned it on.  The update, which among other things allowed me to group apps, made it even better.  Since I'm coming from the Kindle Fire rather than another, more established, smart phone, the lack of apps has not been an issue for me.  I'm also not the app-happy sort who needs to have an app for everything I might ever possibly want to do.  I prefer to keep the device relatively uncluttered. I've found almost every app I wanted on the Amazon App store, the only exceptions being Free42 (an app that simulates the HP 42S scientific calculator) and the app for Jazz 88.3, my local jazz station.  Free42 could be loaded directly from its web page and I was able to download Jazz 88.3 from 1Mobile.com.<br/><br/>At first, I did notice the phones tendency to get very warm, but either I've gotten used to it or, more likely, this has faded as the phone got broken in.  Battery life did seem to be poor, but a couple of things helped improve it greatly:<br/><br/>**Calibrate the battery meter - under heavy use I noticed that the battery very quickly went from a full charge down to 80% (about 40 minutes). But it took almost twice as long to go down to 60%, and even longer to go to 40%.  I ran it down to under 10% and then fully recharged it.  After this the battery appeared to discharge more slowly.  While it's not a good idea to regularly let your battery get that low, doing it once with a new device lets the battery meter know how much charge it has to work with.  This won't actually increase your battery life, but it will appear to as your meter will no longer say you have less charge remaining than you really do.<br/>** Screen brightness- I mostly use the phone indoors in a well-lighted room, and with auto-brightness turned on the screen seemed a lot brighter than it needed to be.  I turned off auto-brightness and set the screen brightness to where I wanted it (about 15-20 %).  When I turned auto-brightness back on the screen got much brighter.  I now leave auto-brightness off most of the time and only turn it on when I'm outside on a bright day.<br/>** E-mail- If you have several e-mail accounts, check how much e-mail you typically receive on each.  If you get 7 or fewer e-mails an hour, set that account to "Push." If you get more than that, set the account to refresh for the longest time you think you can wait to get your latest e-mail.  (You can always force the e-mail app to instantly refresh by pulling the top e-mail halfway down the screen.)<br/>** Battery-eating apps - Be on the lookout for apps that use a lot of battery power.  Typically, these are apps that are always refreshing their information.  I had the USA Today app on my phone for less than a day; it was eating the power something terrible.  Other news apps may behave similarly.  Get rid of them and use the browser to check for the latest news. Free games that show ads are also hogs as they keep downloading ads. Hint: when you want to play one of these games, turn on airplane mode while you do if the game can be used off-line.<br/><br/>After applying these tricks, my battery usually can go over 24 hours before it gets down to 50%.  Bear in mind I'm not talking on it all day and I don't have a Facebook or Twitter account and thus am not "following" a bunch of people constantly.<br/><br/>Bottom line: if you're a happy Kindle Fire user who would like a smaller version you can bring everywhere and also serves as a phone, you'll be very happy with the Fire Phone (but check AT&T; coverage in your area first!)  If, on the other hand, you've been using a smart phone for years and have many apps you depend on, you should do your homework first to make sure the apps you want can be found on the Amazon App store or there is a web page that can perform the same functions for you (90% of the time there is).<br/><br/>Of course, if you hate, loathe, and despise AT&T; with a passion, this is definitely not the phone for you.  Pass it by but for pities sake STOP POSTING ONE-STAR REVIEWS BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE AT&T;! The point has been made (ad nauseum) and you're not adding anything to the discussion at this point. Get over yourself.
When I read all of the bad reviews I wonder if those people received a different phone than me because mine works awesome. People whine and say oh it doesn't have a 1.8 million super power HD screen but the screen is very good better than most phones I tried. The camera works great and it is every bit as fast as they claim.<br/><br/>I will say the lack of Google play services is a little disheartening but some apps if you just download the APK file you can install the App without using the store. Which is what I did with snap-chat and a couple other apps that are not available on the  Amazon store. But at the end of the day it was developed by Amazon for Amazon on an android platform so why would you expect it to be Google filled?<br/><br/>Firefly works epic. It will seriously copy numbers and addresses in an instant. I even for laughs tried it on the phonebook and it sucked up every number on the page. kind of eerie but awesome.<br/><br/>The gimmicky feature with the four cameras that sense your face's position is cool and I wish it had more uses!<br/><br/>All and all I would say it is the best phone I have ever had It is a very well thought out device and I cannot wait for some update and more features.
I Love this phone! My first smart phone was the iPhone then I upgraded to Android. Now I have the fire phone and I love it. If you are a Kindle fire owner and love it, then this phone will be a logical purchase for you. I have to admit the first day or two I was wondering if I made the right decision getting this phone. Reminded me of the transition from iPhone to Android, as in that situation, the more I use the more I love it. This is one of the most beautiful phones I have ever owned outside and in. It has a rich beautiful display and the Dynamic Perspective helps to show that off. The phone runs fast and smooth and I love the elegance of the fire's layout. Even though this is a Android based device, it does take a little getting used to if your not a Kindle owner. But as with any new phone your going to have a bit of a learning curve. The only minor draw back I see is the some what limited selection of apps, but that will be corrected over time. I have had no problems finding my favorite, most used apps. Overall this is a Great phone and I am very happy I decided to purchase it. You get a lot of phone for your money, from the camera, Quad core processor, 2gb of ram, Firefly, Prime membership and the minimum of 32GB of storage space make this is one fantastic buy. Oh and Please ignore the 1 Star Greenpeace spam reviews. This is a Great device.
This is just a heads up that the next gigantic bunch of reviews are from a bunch of looney tunes who do not own the phone. It's from a bunch of lemmings complaining about coal energy. Fun fact--they didn't send their reviews by smoke signal. They used electricity...wasted electricity that some poor African kid with a fly walking across his eyeball could have used to buy some Off spray from Amazon. But do these hypocrites think of the children? NO! They complain on Amazon about coal and reusable energy.<br/><br/>Buy this phone, it's very durable. 9 times out of 10 it won't even scuff when thrown at a hippy...so you can keep reusing it to throw at more hippies.
Amazon redeemed themselves to me today! I was super disappointed about the news of the Fire phone price cut because I paid the original $200 bucks at the Fire phone launch. I felt ripped off. So I went online to read what others were saying and learned that Amazon will give customers, that purchased the phone through them at full price, a "price-match" rebate. I was thrilled! I was told to watch for $198 credit on the card I used for purchase. YAY! I love my new phone and have purchased several Kindles. I didn't want to feel ripped off by a company I have stood by and supported for so many years. Thank you Amazon, my faith in you has been restored!<br/><br/>Call Amazon using Mayday on your phone, the Tech Support can get you the refund.
I like the visual aspects of the Fire Phone better than my iPhone 5s, and I'm getting used to the functionality of the Fire slowly.  However, the Fire Phone lacks some serious aspects including no emojis on the keyboard and the app store is slacking to say the least with no snapchat, discover card app, urbanspoon, or scorecenter downloadable for the phone at this time.  I had to call mayday for two very basic things already which made me feel like I never knew how to work a phone before, how to take a screenshot and how to turn off the vibration when I am writing a text.  It also is delayed about 5 seconds after I exit the messaging app, it tells me I still have an unread message even though I've already read it and replied.<br/><br/> I will continue to see what this phone can do, but I really hope the app store can work on resolving the lack of some serious mainstream apps soon!
This is a great phone if you do a little research and spend a little time to modify it. See attached photo of how my phone currently looks. If you want yours to look like this reply here and I'll respond with some direction. Amazon won't let me do it in the review portion. It really is a 5 star phone with a little work :)
I've been locked in the "Applesphere" for a decade.  I travel 100% for business and I'm a "power phone user."  My phone is essential to my professional life.  Also, I live in a rural area and use Prime very heavily.  I "wanted" to like this phone.<br/><br/>I read the many negative reviews, so I made the trip to a nearby ATT store to see the phone first hand.  I read on these very Amazon reviews that the phone was not intuitive, so I immediately looked for and found a pre-installed app which effectively teaches you the phone's features using a "monkey-see, monkey-do" curriculum.  Following the very effective 3 minute tutorial, I had no questions about any of the phone's features.  Now that I've had some time to use all of those features, I find them incredibly intuitive and useful.  I've owned every generation of iPhone, so there was a short but shallow learning curve.  I now find the features are indeed helpful and represent a significant value added proposition which, for now, make the phone superior to iPhone 5 in usability.  Dynamic perspective is interesting, but not terribly useful unless gaming on the phone.  The phone's battery life was significantly increased by following the FAQs found in the support section.  I have five email accounts on board, and having them all set to "push" was hard on the battery.  I also set the screen to Auto Brightness, and set the screen timeout to 15 seconds of non-use.  As on the iPhone, I am also diligent about closing apps when I'm done with them.  With these few changes, my battery lasts a full workday with usage as required.  I've experienced no issues with excessive heat, even in an Amazon branded case.  Corporate email on Exchange was effortless.  So to was email on Gmail, iCloud, and on a private domain account.  The camera is fantastic.  Almost every major app is available, and suitable proxies for tier-b apps have been easy to find.  Über doesn't yet have an app, but the store shows it "Coming Soon."  Hurry up, Über.<br/><br/>In all, the phone is different.  It's a new, non-Apple-centric paradigm.  I like it.  It works very, very well--especially for hard core business use.  If Amazon would launch a great Gmail-type product, I could be "all in" on Amazon.  Give me a call, Jeff.  I can get that done for you.<br/><br/>And...I got this phone essentially for FREE.  My Prime was extended for a year.  I called ATT (611) and told them I'd buy the Fire Phone if  they would waive all upgrade fees.  They did.  I dropped a subscription photo service, as all photos are streamed to Cloud Drive.  There are also many other value added services which, in total, actually provide economic benefit GREATER than the purchase price of the phone.  So, yes, it was really a free phone.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Price<br/>Very, very fast browsing<br/>Size (not getting any younger)<br/>Camera<br/>Usability<br/>Swype Typing<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>No Über app (Coming soon)<br/>No Delta app<br/>Lack of Tier B apps<br/>Requires a bit of diligence in battery management<br/>My kids miss iPhone emoticons
I bought the fire phone after the software update and it has been great. No trouble with battery life and the cameral is awesome.
The only problem people may have is the lack of apps compared to Google and App Store.<br/>Yes, I can not use my Strava, Movescount and a bunch os useless apps that I do have in my iPhone.<br/><br/>It has a very good OS, very fast and efficient. The geometry is great, the size of the screen is perfect for my needs.<br/>Battery life is good, much better than my iPhone 5s. The email app is excellent, the keyboard is good, the speakers are much better than others, it comes with a great pair of headphones.<br/><br/>The size of the screen is perfect for reading, I can read my books at any spare time I have. I have used twice the Mayday, great stuff. You get rewards (coins) from purchases and all your amazon stuff is there (music, movies, account, etc.).<br/><br/>Once the Google/Amazon app thing is settled (hopefully) everyone will have their nice apps and will have a different opinion about Fire phone.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this is a very good phone with a lot of potential.
I really love my Fire Phone. My only complaint is Google Play apps are not available unless you sideload them.<br/><br/>The Fire Phone is not for everyone though. I have been heavily invested in Amazon's products since the Kindle Fire release. A day does not go by where I am not browsing Amazon- in fact, Prime is the only thing I use with my television.<br/><br/>When the Fire Phone was released, I wanted to immediately go out and purchase it. I have been wanting to upgrade my phone for awhile now- I was using a basic free smartphone from straight talk. That said, I decided to hold off and wait for the 2nd gen Fire Phone, so all the kinks are worked out.<br/><br/>When Amazon lowered the price to $.99, I jumped at the opportunity. Not only was the phone next to free, but an extra year of Prime added to my account too? Yes, please!<br/><br/>Being able to consistently use the gestures took some getting use to. Now I have next to no problems and find the one-handed gestures quite useful. I see many people claim they are buggy and only work half the time. This has definitely not been my experience- I think people may just try to do them too quickly.<br/><br/>Now, as mentioned, my previous phone was one of the most basic smartphones- the Samsung Galaxy Proclaim. I did not use many apps and it was primarily for calls and texting. The Fire Phone is an upgrade in every way. My point is, I could understand why someone that had a semi-current iPhone or Galaxy would not rate the Fire Phone very highly. The Fire Phone has some cool features but nothing that can really make up for the lack of Google Play, if you are an app junky. But if you're like me and rarely use apps, this won't impact you too much.<br/><br/>In summary, I love my Fire Phone. It is not for everyone but I believe it is a step in the right direction and hope Amazon continues the product line.
I love my fire phone! Its easy to use, very durable, and a lot more affordable than the other phones! Very happy and would recommend it to others.
I won't do a tech/specs breakdown review here - that's for others out there, I will simply share the every day user experience & things that I use/do most often & that my friends & neighbors all asked about as soon as they realized I had the new Amazon phone in my hand. I am switching over after two years with a Samsung Galaxy Note to the Fire Phone and I was expecting some drama and growing pains to be honest. There are some small aggravations, but that is to be expected any time you move into a new house and that's sort of what switching your smart phone is like. First...trust me on this....take a moment to stop and think logically and give yourself a little time to physically get used to the Fire & the wrist motions to open menus or scroll etc and the fact that the dynamic perspective does not require you to move the whole phone, just your head to experience it. Second spend some time wandering through the phone and checking out all it's features - I realized pretty quickly that some of the things I had apps for with my old phone, were already installed and part of the Fire, thus no need for an app at all. (Dual time zone clock for example)<br/><br/>My Experience so far -<br/><br/>Screen/Picture - The resolution is astonishing. So crisp and clear. Streaming a tv show on the phone was as nice as watching it on my HD television - both with WiFi and on 3G streaming. The touch screen is very, very sensitive and super responsive with almost no lag time which in turn leads to the point that the phone itself is very fast and responsive in moving from task to task.<br/><br/>Blue Tooth & Ford SYNC - The biggest concern for me with any phone is if it will connect properly with my Ford SYNC system. This is a must. Connecting to our 2013 MyTouch version of SYNC was immediate and easy. The car recognized the phone and all features worked together, plus the Fire Phone passes my text messages through to the SYNC system which will read them out loud as I'm driving and even send a pre-selected message back. My old phone was never capable of that feature! My music all streams from the Fire to the car through the Blue Tooth & the song info appears on the car's screen as it should. Additionally, the Fire connected with an external Blue Tooth speaker in the house and a pair of earphones for use outside.<br/><br/>Email - I was able to add three email accounts to my Fire Phone very quickly and easily - including my Gmail account with no drama at all. All 3 are syncing and new messages coming in correctly with no delays. Replying and forwarding functions are working correctly as well. You can see each mailbox individually or all at once if you like. Attached links work properly and linked YouTube videos opened immediately and played correctly. Attaching photos from your phone is a flick of the wrist and the option appears on the right side of the screen. Could not be easier.<br/><br/> Camera - The camera does need more settings options - like action & low light etc. Though I may need more time to learn all it's tricks too. In normal lighting the few pictures I've taken are good. I do like the option of the "lenticular" photos - you can sort of take your own pictures for the dynamic perspective, that will take some practice to get the hang of though. And I haven't figured out how to edit photos yet, though that may need an app download.<br/><br/>Phone Calls - Calls have been no better and no worse than my old Note phone was. I was on AT&T; before so there's no change on that end. Ringtones can be customized using Mp3s (songs) by downloading a Ringtone Maker app (several free ones in the Amazon App store). I was able to pick an app, load it, clip 5 songs for 5 specific contacts and was finished in literally less than 6 minutes. Each of those people called me today and the ringtones worked correctly. <<<  Blocking calls - this was something that was pretty painless on my old Note and something that I was disappointed to see Amazon forgot to include on the Fire Phone - the simple ability to immediately block a phone number so that it never rings through again or at the least goes directly to voice mail any and every time it calls you. (Crazy Amway lady 4 houses down, I am looking at YOU) Again, the app store fixed this problem. Multiple Call Blocker apps to choose from and they range from free to 5 dollars, so an extra step, but doable and problem solved.<br/><br/>Transferring Data from old Phone to Fire - This was awesome! I was dreading this part and it turned out to be painless. Download the AT&T; Mobile Transfer app to both your old phone and your new Fire Phone and follow the instructions. The app swapped 485 photos, 85 documents, 128 contacts with addresses, 800 SMS messages, 22 emails, 200 songs, 1 video & other data from my old Note to the new phone in about 12 minutes flat over WiFi. Done. I set both phones down and mopped the kitchen while they did their thing. The Fire had all my info and was ready to go like it had always been my phone. Be sure to back up your photos to your Amazon Cloud Drive before you swap your phones - just to be safe.<br/><br/>Apps & Functions - There are only a couple of apps that I really miss from the Google world - a specific bank app and Flight Aware. Others are easily found in the Amazon store or very similar and just as functional versions. The Fire Map function is just as good as the Google Maps - testing it with 3 addresses in 3 states complete with asking for driving directions to those address and comparing them with the Google Maps yielded the same results, so I am satisfied with it. That dynamic perspective pops up as a cool thing on the maps here and there too. Games on the Fire Phone are pretty neat - it comes installed with a couple that highlight the dynamic perspective feature and the ones I play on my Fire HDX Tablet work just as nicely on the Fire Phone (The Walking Dead & Pandemic for example) Audible.com & Kindle apps both smoothly populated with my books immediately on registering the phone and opening the apps and both work smoothly as you would expect since they are all Amazon integrated products. The Firefly button is it's own little ball of cute useful mixed with silly time waster. Testing it on random music from the car radio produced correct results every single time, so did testing it on a song from a country music CD and a Beethoven CD. Testing it on a television show revealed the name of the show, the season & episode and the narrator. I even used it at an estate sale this morning to check the price of a book and found the same used book for less from a 3rd party seller at Amazon. (Which is the entire purpose of Firefly) Oddly, it did not recognize an item I had purchased from Amazon a few months ago, but there was an option to send the photo to Amazon and tell them what it was, so the system is evolving.<br/><br/>Bottom Line - if you are already immersed in the Amazon universe, then this is phone will simplify your life to some extent and certainly organize your digital life to a great degree. All the Amazon planets will revolve together...Your Prime Membership, Audible, Kindle, Cloud, Fire Table, Fire Phone, Streaming Video and Streaming Music and of course shopping. Even if you're not, this is still a darn good phone in a lot of ways and certainly worth consideration.My only real caveat so far is that it may yet turn out to be a battery hog - hard to judge that after only two days though. To be fair, I have been playing with it and every function it has constantly and so has anyone that comes close and can get their hands on it. On the plus side, it recharges very fast, much faster than my Galaxy Note. The Fire Phone is light weight, feels good in the hand and is pretty intuitive and for those things that stump you, the Mayday button is one touch away for free live help which is something I never had with Samsung or Blackberry back in the day. I will definitely be keeping my new Fire Phone and I think it will become an extension of my hand even more than my Note was for the past two years.<br/><br/>UPDATE July 27th- Battery Drain issue and fix.<br/>My battery was draining very fast the first day and I chalked it up to playing around with all the features and the phone populating itself with all my Amazon stuff...books, photos, music etc etc. The second day I realized it was the background processes constantly running and I resorted to the same fix I used with my old Galaxy Note phone the first week I had it (same problem). The Amazon App store has the AVG Antivirus specifically for the Fire Phone (free) and it has a task killer that keeps these things in check. 24 hours later.... significant improvement!!!<br/><br/>UPDATE August 15, 2014 - Software update & user tips<br/><br/>Amazon released a software update for the Fire Phone this week that offered some good tweaks based on user suggestions. Mainly, far and away improved battery life. Thanks guys! Additional features we got are the ability to pin our most used or favorite apps to the front of the carousel, no more incessant scrolling, the ability to delete emails directly from the carousel without opening your email client at all, and my favorite is the lock screen photo locket. You can have your custom lock screen photo and many more available to view simply by flicking the right edge of the screen...show photos to friends quickly without opening the entire file or scrolling through hundreds of others you don't want at that moment.<br/><br/>Using the Fire Phone in sunlight - This was on the phone from day one, but I just realized it a few days ago... leaving your screen brightness setting on "auto" means it will self adjust according to the actual light wherever you are using your phone. I had put mine on low out of habit from my previous Galaxy phone as a battery saving step, so I was missing out one of my Fire's best features! You can see this screen IN SUNLIGHT!! No more darting into shade or holding a hand over the screen or squinting to read email etc. Honestly, I am loving this phone more with each week that goes by.<br/><br/>UPDATE September 9, 2014 - Starbucks app work around<br/><br/>For those who are lamenting the missing Starbucks app... the workaround is very simple and it works perfectly. Use the Amazon Wallet on your Fire Phone and Firefly your Starbucks card, front and back as a gift card into the wallet. Done. It scans from your phone at Starbucks with no problems at all and deducts correctly from your account. The wallet app on your phone updates automatically once a day or your can do it manually if you prefer with a single swipe of a finger. I added money to my Starbucks account from my phone the other day and it worked correctly. This may not be as slick as the old school Google app was, but it works and it's one time scan to put your card on your phone and done.
I have had two Kindle Fires, the original and now the HD. My smart phones have always been Android based (past 3 were Samsung) and I love my Kindle Fire, so it made sense to me to make my phone the Fire Phone to have my tablet and phone on the same interface. "But it's limited." Well, so is my husbands iOS phone, but he loves Apple products and uses it because it's what he likes. Since I use a Kindle Fire and like the interface, the Fire Phone works well for me. It's all about personal preferences.<br/><br/>Pros: Functionality is like my Kindle Fire, makes it easy to go between devices.<br/>-Amazon product and customer service backed.<br/>-Apps I use are easy to download after I registered my phone since I already had them on my Amazon account.<br/>-Free year of Prime, we use it for shipping and Instant Video all the time.<br/>-Camera - I am shaky when taking pics half the time, this takes much clearer pictures, quick to open with a click of the button on the side of the phone and snap, you're done.<br/>-Carousel is great to have on my phone, quick and easy to find an app, pic, etc.<br/>-Sound quality is great! I am horrible at hearing my phone go off and don't miss this, even across the house. Movies and music have been easy to listen to, also.<br/>-I like having a sealed battery, less of a chance of me knocking it out like I've done on previous phones.<br/>-I can display the battery % just like other phones, very helpful.<br/><br/>Cons: Limited Android, so some apps are not available from the developers on Amazon.com. Instead I have to go to their mobile website, if it's available. Or just wait and do what I need to while on my PC at home.<br/>-Carousel also lists my phone. Very annoying when I just want to click on the phone icon to make calls and don't want a list of calls made sitting on my carousel. If I want to see it, I will click on the icon. I initially would remove it from the carousel each time, but have given up now.<br/>-Dynamic perspective was fun at first, but the novelty has worn off, so I turned it off.<br/>-Volume control: I wish when I swiped down it showed my volume control and I wish it showed a volume icon next to the time like most phones. I hate second guessing if I actually turned it silent at work. I have to click the volume buttons to check, or select silent or ring. Instead, swiping from the top and being to control it there would be easier.<br/>-Ring tones are limited, it's fine for calls.<br/>-Alarm Clock uses only the ring tones available on the phone - which scared the crap out of my husband that first morning, so I was instructed to find an alternative as he did not want to wake up to "noise." Instead, I got a free app that uses songs in my pibrary, much better.<br/><br/>Battery: Initially in the first couple of days I was plugging it in every night with less than 15% battery life left. Of course I was using it like crazy, getting everything set just right, playing around with features, etc, etc just like any other phone I have had. Now I have had it a few weeks, I plug it in every 2-3 days. My typical use is phone calls a couple times a day, web browser when in town, web browsing at home, some app play.<br/>-All in all, battery life is about the same as my previous Android phones.<br/><br/>Firefly: I used this a couple times for fun, playing around. Neat feature, worked well, not super fast as it sound like it happens in a split second, but not slow either. I know it will be used down the road here and there.<br/><br/>Auto Scroll: This is a neat feature, but I have it off right now. More of a personal choice. I just need to turn it on and get used to using it.<br/><br/>AT&T;: We've been with them for almost 10 years and have had zero issues, great deals and great help. Thus it's a non issue for me. I can see how being a non AT&T; user would create issues though.<br/><br/>Overall I am very happy with the phone. The pros definitely out way the cons for me and being Amazon's first phone, I expect improvement to keep coming.
I have had my phone a little over a week.  It's a replacement to a Windows Phone (Nokia Lumia 900).  I really liked the Windows phone a lot - I will just start by saying that.  Had an iPhone for about a day and a half - hated it.  Had several early-version Androids, and like them all.  So, it was an easy transition to go back to an Android based phone with the Fire OS overlay.  I do miss live tiles on the Windows phone, but that's about it.<br/><br/>I read through a lot of reviews, and it's funny, because I am not having any of the problems that seem to be prevalent.  My phone does not get excessively hot, and battery life is great (have not charged the phone in two days, and it is still over 70%.).  I am NOT a heavy phone talker, though.  Mostly check e-mails, and use it for web-based stuff.  The Silk browser seems just fine to me.  I used to have a Fire HD tablet, so maybe I am just used to it.  Were I to compare it to a true Android with a faster processor I am sure it page loads would be slower, but honestly, do I really care if a page takes 3 seconds to load instead of 1.5?  Nope.  Streaming videos has been perfect - no lag time whatsoever, and the image quality is phenomenal.<br/><br/>The one thing I will suggest to people is REALLY get to know the phone.  Get into the menus and customize it to your way of liking.  There are SO MANY changes you can make to the basic configuration.  My only disappointment, and it's a silly one, is the lack of any decent ringtones.  Very few come on the phone, and they all sound like bad elevator music.<br/><br/>I was up for a new contract with AT&T; and my prime had just expired, so this purchase was a no-brainer for me.  I am a very heavy Amazon user, and it's a piece of cake to place and monitor orders with this phone.  Love having seamless access to all of my Amazon content as well - books, magazines, videos, etc.  You can debate specs and OS strength ad infinitum, but if the phone does what you need it to do?  To me it's perfect.  I honestly can't imagine how anyone who is NOT a big Amazon user would benefit from this phone, but if you are?  There really is not a reason I have found so far that would make me suggest you look any further.  (Unless you hate AT&T;, I guess).  I have been with them for over 10 years and have no problems with the service.<br/><br/>Update 8-20-14<br/><br/>I finally had the experience where my phone got really hot (and yes, REALLY hot), and the battery drained by 25% in about 10 minutes.  The lock screen failed to go into sleep mode, thus I am guessing that Dynamic Perspective caused the fast drain.  Not sure WHY it happened, but I have made sure to put the phone into sleep mode whenever I set it down now, and it has not happened again.  Hope this helps some!!
I waited for a few days to compose a review so I could get some use before I passed any judgment. I like the phone overall but it has some issues. The first, and most significant to me, is the battery life. I've yet to see a smart phone that lasts as long as I would like so I didn't expect the battery to last all day. I was disappointed because I was doing some surfing for what I thought was a short time and used about half of the battery. The music app isn't integrated very well with the Prime Music app. If I download some Prime Music it won't be listed with my other music. I've also tried a few times to download music and had multiple failures. I had to try multiple times to download one album. The phone is missing the ability to organize apps by category but does allow one to move them around. Also, on the app issue, there are many apps that I would like to see that aren't here but I have a Kindle so that wasn't a surprise. Most of the problems I have with this phone may be able to be fixed by updates.<br/>Still, it's not all bad. I am a Prime fan and now I have access to all of it on my phone and since I have been a Kindle fan for a while it's slick that things sync to my phone, Kindle, and Fire TV. The firefly ability is useful to identify many things. The camera works much better than my iPhone 4's did. I like that I have a phone with stereo speakers that have some volume ability beyond my iPhone 4. I'm still glad I got the phone and I'm certain they'll work out these bugs. I would have given 4 stars but the battery life issue really bugs me.<br/><br/>Addendum: I also hope they add some integration between the phone and the computer Amazon Music app. I would like to be able to add/remove music and sync with my laptop.
Okay, now I am going to be completely honest.  I almost returned this phone because of all the negative reviews but I decided to judge it for myself.  I'll get the negative stuff out of the way first.<br/>Cons:<br/>1. No back button.  I learned that you could go back a screen by swiping the lower half of the phone vertically from the bottom up and I think that is really weird.<br/>2. Data usage on my plan has increased since getting this phone.  It uses data constantly while swiping through the carousel for email, maps, products Amazon is trying to sell you, etc.  I have never went over my data plan before, but I did within the first month of using this phone.<br/>3. Dynamic Perspective.  I have turned that off and saw a vast improvement in battery life.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1. I am not as addicted to google as I thought.  I put in my gmail email account info and don't need to use Google for anything else.<br/>2. Elegant design.  I had a Samsung Galaxy 3 and this phones display makes that ones look like its made for preschoolers.  Although it uses more data the carousel is awesome and while it does promote buying stuff from Amazon, I would have gotten the stuff from Amazon anyways because they have a great variety of items.<br/>3. Button for easy access to camera is very good idea.<br/>4. I have found all my favorite apps: Spotify, Sirius XM radio, Chase bank, etc.  I have not missed any apps that I uses frequently.<br/>5. 64 Gbs of storage is awesome and all phones should have the option to get it without buying a micro card.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm very happy with this phone and just wanted to let people know that it does have good features.
I love my Fire Phone. Many of the problems people have with the Fire Phone can be easily solved with a basic knowledge of smartphones. I have every non-Google app that I need on here, even ones that aren't in the app store. If you go to your security settings and click "Allow Install From Unknown Sources" and search for the Apk file of the app you're looking for,  you can  download that and the app will run on your phone just like an Android phone would run it. It's only a couple extra steps and takes literally 5 minutes a  app. If the Apk isn't out there, you can get it yourself. (Search "How To Extract Apk File From Android App). Second, people complain of not having a back button. The Fire Phone is based on gestures, and the back "button" is simply swiping up from the bottom of the screen. Thirdly, people complain of the Dynamic Perspective interface. This can be disabled in settings, though it is one of the more unique features of the Fire Phone. Lastly, some people dislike the fact that the status bar is non present for most of the screens. In "Settings," there is an option that enables persistent status bar, so it will never hide. Also, swiping down from the top of the screen will show the notification tray so you can see the time and access quick settings. This phone is so much better than I ever Houghton it would be and it is my favorite phone. I have come over from the Samsung Galaxy series, have the S3 and S4, and using the S5 and Note 4 on a regular basis. This phone has my heart, and if you understand smartphones and love Amazon.com, this will be your favorite phone too.
I love my fire phone. Backed by Amazon's unparalleled customer service, it is just what I needed. I have had an iphone for 3 + years and I was so over it. I read all the reviews about the firephone and felt that the issues people had woudln't be a big deal to me and they aren't. They only thing I don't love are the headphones but who cares, I can get new ones. <3 My fire phone and unless you are tied to itunes or google play in a way that you wouldn't be able to live without those three obscure apps, then you will too.
I've had the phone for 5 days and it really makes me miss my iPhone. First off, the apps run slow and sluggish. I can't find the appropriate apps that I need, and when I download a substitute app, it doesn't do what I need. For example, I can't print from my phone! Secondly, people complain they can't hear me. When I adjust the phone so they can, the sound is terrible and shrill which hurts my ear. But that is the only way people can hear me when talking. This phone fails at the very basic thing it's meant to do. The only thing this phone rocks at is shopping on Amazon or talking to Amazon's customer service. I'm so disappointed I bought this phone. :-(
I wanted to give up this phone in the beginning, as it only has amazon appstore. I cannot find wechat, QQ, etc.  However, if you know how to install apps from unknown source, actually you can install many apps which you use daily.  Just download apk file and install it.<br/>even you can install google core service by copying google service, gmail, frame etc  apk file to your fire phone and install it.<br/><br/>This phone is designed solid, feel good,not cheap. after 2 days optimization, i love this phone.<br/><br/>Cons:  most of the iphone user  donot know to how install app through unknown source,  will think this phone is bad. However, once you know how to utilize this phone,  it is worth 4 star and above.
I've had the Fire phone for over 2 months now, so I've pretty much figured out and examined everything it has in its current form.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>-  Incredible screen and resolution.  Very beautiful to look at<br/>-  Dynamic Perspective is actually something that grows on you and that I've come to love.  The icons move with your gaze and it has much potential in the future.<br/>-  Construction is excellent, feels very solid in my hand.  Not too big or too small.<br/>-  The Amazon eco-system has all the basics along with Kindle Reader and my best friend, Audible.<br/>-  The Amazon app store has a "Free App of the Day" where an app that was previously charging is free to download for that day and is yours to keep.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>- I am not a fan of the carousel icon display on the "home page".  Essentially you roll through your most recent opened apps, but I end up ignoring it 90% of the time and going through to find the specific app in my app sections. I see where Amazon was going with it though.  You can see detailed information on the app without pressing any buttons.  However, the layout appears cramped.<br/><br/>- App support.  If you have an app in your mind you really want, its 50/50 chance it will be in the Amazon store.  Amazon does not share the same apps with the Google marketplace, so Im having to do without some old favorites.  Hopefully Amazon ports more apps in.
I love this phone! Take the poor reviews with a grain of salt... I have used the phone all day long with FB, emails, phone calls, Netflix, YouTube and IHeart Radio. The phone NEVER GOT HOT AND the BATTERY HAS LASTED ALL DAY AND NIGHT. The size and weight is perfect in the hand (who wants a phone that is as lite as a feather?), the phone is lite while also feeling very solid.<br/>Dynamic Perspective is fun! and is nice to use with maps. Firefly works very well ( 7 out of 10 were recognized) and when it did not recognize something it was my error of aiming the camera. The phone has plenty of useful apps for me (does anyone really have the time to use hundreds of apps?)<br/>If the Amazon app store does not have a app that you like, you can down load it from another source. Just go to YouTube and they will show you how. The front and back Gorilla glass can be protected with Skinomi or ArmorSuit MilitaryShield.<br/>I love this phone!
I was impressed by the announcement - particularly Firefly - and curious to see the "almost 3D" interface.<br/><br/>When the phone arrived, I unpacked it and carefully removed the SIM card since I did not want to switch my service until I was certain I would like the phone. It was a bit tricky to get the card released. Once it was, I went through the phone set up quickly to see how it performed and what it could do.<br/><br/>I was underwhelmed.<br/><br/>The problem for Amazon was building a differentiated product that could compete against Android based handsets and maybe also iOS. It is not clear to me why anyone would want this phone. It runs a forked version of Android. However, Amazon basically lobotomized Android to create the environment on this phone. If you are an Android power user, you will be immediately frustrated by what is not there - in other words, Amazon removed all sorts of customization features of Android (from settings to home screen, etc.). They added some apps and a UI that is sort of a pretender to iOS but not.<br/><br/>The result is something that looks slick when you first turn it on but quickly becomes tedious and frustrating. It is even missing some of the limited privacy controls of Google Android - and that should give you an idea of now invasive this phone is - all the time. You can't control the reaping of your information and usage statistics. If you use this phone, you are inviting Amazon to know all the details of your life.<br/><br/>As for the famous UI that uses the four cams in the corners of the device, count me out. Not worth the money. You basically have a cutesy attempt at 3D that is not at all useful.<br/><br/>As if all that wasn't enough to deep six this confused phone, it does not have tethering capabilities at all. That is crazy since it is already in the Android source.<br/><br/>I gave it one star because at least it has a reasonable case and form factor. That said, it weighs a lot more than other Android devices.<br/><br/>Sadly, is a terrible product.
Have had the phone for a day and a half at this point.  I was not eager to use a touch screen only phone but chose this one as I am comfortable with my HDX.  I will state that I do use amazon very regularly and would continue to do so even if I had a different phone.<br/><br/>I find that it is very easy to use with minimal learning curve for me.. am assuming that is from using the HDX.<br/>Battery life has been better than expected but will admit that I'm not like my teens.. it's not doing 'something' 24/7.<br/>Although I like features, internet and apps.. this, to me, is still a phone and it needed to make calls well...<br/>Have found that call quality is good and reception is equal to what I was used to with my Blackberry.<br/><br/>Was not excited about spending the money and very very leery about buying a Generation 1 anything..  Was on the edge of my seat waiting for something, anything to go wrong and it would have been back at the store within the hour. Didn't happen.. I'm very pleased. It does what I'd hoped and seems to do it well.<br/><br/>The only issue I had was with ringtones. Nothing on the phone suited me as I like a louder, more urgent tone. Purchased an MP3 and learned that it couldn't be used yet (Amazon is  adding a phone update).  But with the download of a ringtone maker from app store, it works beautifully.  Also, Mayday is fabulous!!  The person I spoke with was great and eager to solve my issue.<br/><br/>Will update if necessary.
Solid 4 stars. Based on what I read online before I got the phone, it's clearly not for everyone, but for me it's been great:<br/><br/>From an everyday use perspective, I've been really happy:<br/>* Good battery life (lasts at least a full day while syncing 5 e-mail accounts, facebook, twitter, WhatsApp, surfing the web, playing games every once in a while, etc)<br/>* Nice screen, big enough to be readable but not so big that the phone doesn't fit comfortably in my pocket. Readable in sunlight. The auto brightness seems to get confused sometimes in dark rooms but overall works OK<br/>* Comfortable to hold in one hand, usable with one hand. Swipe gestures definitely help with that. The rubber edge feels comfortable in the palm of your hand. I don't have a case for the phone.<br/>* Reception is very good, call quality is great. The phone is reasonably comfortable to hold up to your face to make actual phone calls with.<br/>* The OS is responsive, and despite being newish is pretty stable and functional.<br/>* I haven't used Firefly a lot but every time I've tried to use it, it has worked for me.<br/>* This is my first carrier locked phone in around 10 years and I thought that would really bug me but in fact AT&T; has shown remarkable restraint and there's only one visible bit of AT&T; software preloaded on the phone. No telling what will happen when I try to use the phone abroad, but it's got a nano-SIM anyway which is inconvenient for swapping out so I'll probably just take an old Nokia with my when I travel.<br/><br/>My only gripes so far:<br/>* It gets surprisingly warm during use. Not uncomfortably hot, but warm enough that I wonder how the heck the battery will last the day. So far it always has.<br/>* The Firefly button works even when the phone is locked. That's pitched as a feature, but what it means to me is that frequently when I take it out of my pocket, it's already active and trying desperately to identify something. This probably has a negative impact on battery life, and could lead to butt-dialing. It would be nice if this could be switched off.<br/>* The app store is ... almost adequate. There are definitely some things missing, though I can get 90% of what I want by sideloading. There are very few apps that just won't run when sideloaded, and those apps have alternatives. Sideloading is inconvenient but as of now I've got everything I need. This is the biggest area of improvement as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>I would recommend this phone to many people, but not everyone. If you're the sort of person who wants to hack your phone and use custom firmwares, you'll hate this phone. If you're the sort of person who wants to sample each one of the 1 million apps in the Play store, you won't like this phone.<br/><br/>If you want a phone that's not comically big, is comfortable and friendly to use, and works when you want it to, this is a nice phone. It's a perfect phone for normal people who aren't necessarily gadget freaks but want a modern, useful smartphone. If you're a Symbian refugee looking for an entry into the Android world that's not obnoxious, you can do worse than this one (but you'll miss your OLED screen).
Many reviews here initially turned me away from the fire, but after reading about the updates via firmware addressing battery issues I can honestly say I'm really happy with the phone.  The biggest complaint I hear is about the number of apps, but honestly Amazon is developing their app ecosystem, just as Apple's app store wasn't great at first, in time it will develop.  If you're leaning on the fence, check one out in person, the quality and feel are solid.  So far very happy!
I like my Fire Phone. I agree with some of the reviews here about some of the operational problems in the apps and the lack of availability of certain apps; however, I guess I am one of those folks that's willing to wait a little bit for software updates and growth of the app store to fix some of the problems.<br/><br/>The phone itself is well-made, and I, personally, really like the swipe features. You have to get used to them for sure, but they are great and really convenient after that.<br/><br/>I have had iPhones for FOREVER. I also have a large collection of Apple products (an iMac, Macbook Air, iPad). When my last iPhone went to phone heaven, I went to the ATT store looking to get another.<br/><br/>To be honest, the shear price difference was what started me looking at the Fire Phone. I love Amazon and Prime. I have had nothing but good experiences with them. For me, what's most important in a phone is storage space, the camera, and the screen. The Fire phone delivers in all of these areas for much cheaper than an iPhone. If I want to use Apple features, I'll just use one of my other Apple products. I did that before anyway.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this to anyone looking to get more phone and more perks for your money. I believe that the other problems with apps and such will be fixed as updates are released.
Dear Amazon,<br/><br/>Keep working on this phone because it has the potential to be great. I firmly believe, once the kinks are worked out, this will be a gamechanger.<br/><br/>As someone who has exclusively used iPhones for years, this phone naturally took a little bit of time to get used to. But not long.  Anyone who has used an iPhone will find that the functionality of this phone is very, very similar in many respects. Once you play and poke around for a bit - which in my case was for about a couple of hours or so - you will find, as did I, that this phone is extremely easy to navigate and the way the system is set up is intuitive and even easy.<br/><br/>Of course, getting things done on the phone differs in certain respects from other phones. I can only compare it to an iPhone and say thst certain features I enjoyed on the iPhone, like printing an email directly from my email app to an airprinter, isn't currently available on the fire phone.<br/><br/>But that will change, I believe. As will also the availability of more apps that we have been accustomed to using on other phones (ex. Bank Apps).<br/><br/>Just give it time.<br/><br/>If there is a company out there that really listens to its customers and takes suggestions seriously, it's Amazon. Several times already I've contacted them through the feedback link on the phone and have had a rep respond promptly, answer my question and then forward my comments on to the response team.<br/><br/>To anyone who is considering this phone, my suggestion is to tune out all the naysayers and go to your local store and try it out. That's what I did. I kept reading reviews on various websites and on this site, some positive and some extremely negative, and didn't know what to make of the phone. Was it as great as some people said or a complete dud like others were suggesting? The answer, I realized, wouldn't be found by browsing the web for reviews. I had to do my own review. So I went to the AT&T; store, got it in my hands and played with it.<br/><br/>Shortly thereafter, I bought it.<br/><br/>That's how much I liked it. And every person I asked who worked in that store, including those in a second store I visited on another day, loved the phone. Why? Because as employees they had the chance to use the phone hands-on and see how great it is. Therefore, if you are interested in this phone, don't rely on some review written by someone else. Get to a store, try it out and make your own judgment. Spend the time poking around and navigating and ask questions. If you do that I promise you will see the potential of this phone. I did.<br/><br/>So go ahead and give it a try. You might find you like the phone. Or even love it!
I went from an old iPhone 3 to this Fire phone and am pretty happy with it. The display is very nice, the phone is bigger than I expected, and the camera is quite impressive! I also find it nice to be able to use it for all the things I have on my Kindle Fire, including the same charger.<br/>I had to turn auto-scroll off because I move too much for it's sensitivity. I have also  found that the sensitivity for the swivel/tilt has decreased since I've been using the phone (about a month) and I find it nearly impossible now to get the left or right sided menus that way. The battery doesn't last but about two days max, I do leave it on 24/7 tho. Finally, I had to download a free calender app because it woldn't let me use the one that it came with, it would tell me that I needed to create an account, and when I went to do so, it told me one already existed  with my information.  So I've had some minor frustrations with it, but at least it rings everytime someone calls, which is more than the old iPhone 3 did.
I just bought this phone. It is a little different than my Android so I'm still learning where everything is, but WOW I'm impressed! It has all the apps I need and seeps really responsive. Feels substantial too, so that was a surprise. Has a quality feel to it, not like super lightweight phones I've had in the past.
Solid overall phone. I am not a heavy app user, so the absence of some apps really isn't noticeable to me. Everything I use is available -- social media, uber, AMC, etc., and for those that are not I found suitable replacements. I've been using the iPhone since Gen 1, and I simply wanted to try something new without forking over $700. I've not experienced the hardware issues and battery life challenges some of have reported, but I also am not on my phone 24-7.  I've been pleased with my purchase, although the software was a bit of an adjustment the first few days because I've been using Apple devices for so long.
UPDATE 11/5/14<br/>OK after a few months with this phone I can say what a piece of GARBAGE.  Its not the phones fault the phone itself is a good phone its the Horse S that amazon has dumped onto it that makes it garbage.  I hate that you can only get apps from Amazon(I understand its their phone)if they want to be in the phone market they need to be all in or not.  I have multiple apps that claim there is an update available and to download the update.  But when you go to the amazon store there is no update so those apps are useless.  Amazon takes their sweet time updating apps, also convert every app why should I be limited to what you feel is Amazon worthy.<br/><br/>That Fire camera app---WHAT USELESS JUNK unless you are scanning a barcode or url it has no feature except to be annoying.  It is the most sensitive button I have ever seen you graze it and wham Fire app.  So thats nice when its been on in your pocket for 20 mins and now your battery is dead.<br/><br/>Dont try and watch youtube videos or show someone an article because the phone is a clingy 2 year old baby.  As you pass the phone to show someone something it stays on your eyes and then scrolls to the bottom of the page.  This also happens when watching youtube and your turn the phone sideways.  Yea thats fun as you scream at the phone becaus eyou just want to watch a youtube video but the phone says screw you I want to show you the bottom of the page past 50000000 comments.  Have fun scrolling tot he top again.<br/><br/>Its CRAP do yourself a favor if you are under 85 years of age buy a different phone the features get old real fast.<br/><br/>The fire os is great for tablets lets leave it at that<br/><br/>I have had many phones being an IT professional, mostly iPhones and a few Windows phones.  I also have had a few tablets from ipads to windows Android and Kindles.  The phone is not that bad, I feel that some of these 1 Star reviews came out after Amazon lowered the price to .99.  The Fire Phones contacts do backup unlike what I read on another review, you have the option to save a new contact to an email account or to Amazon.  That being said there are some minor annoyances i have found<br/><br/>The Power button...Its in the wrong spot it should be in the middle on the top of the phone not to the left of it.  No human finger can bend that way when holding a phone in one hand swap the speaker and the power button.<br/><br/>The Camera button...I like that I can press the button and go right to the camera with the phone locked.  I dont like that if I graze the button I go to the camera its nice seeing 4000 pictures of the inside of my pocket.  Need to make it so holding down the button when locked activates the camera and pressing it does nothing.<br/><br/>Sensitivity... I feel like a Jedi Knight using my phone my finger is not even close to the screen and it opens an app.<br/><br/>Apps...either let me install the google play store or get a team to convert every app to Amazon app store.<br/><br/>Like I said minor stuff other than that so far a month in and I really like the phone.  I am not an apple fan boy I would have said with the Iphone 3s they make a good product but now they lost me.  Fire phone is a good competitor  lots of nice features easy to use and the best part you dont need some stupid software on your PC to sync it.<br/><br/>I would give 5 stars if they could fix the 2 buttons.
Dear GREENPEACE:<br/><br/>I just want you to know that as a supporter of Greenpeace for decades, I have had just about enough of your ignorance and juvenile actions.  You no longer represent me or my beliefs.<br/><br/>You are doing more harm than good by recruiting trolls exclaiming "rabble rabble rabble!" with no purpose, just to abuse the review and rating system of a cell phone.  You ignorant freaks send hundreds of these trolls to rate a product they do not own, and know nothing about WHY they are rating it as such. Talk about "dirty energy"!<br/><br/>It is a discussion.  Not a freaking game.  Amazon and it's head staff, founders and developers have done more for the environment than Greenpeace has ever done.  If you got your heads out of your arses you would be able to see that.<br/><br/>So continue your stupid slanderous campaign, as each day continues to devalue your organization and embarrass all that supported you in the past or present.  Clearly all these kids needed something to do with their time when not folding shirts at Hot Topic.<br/><br/>I believe this is the end of your organization and you deserve every backlash there is that will bring you down.<br/><br/>I regret every dollar and minute of my time ever devoted to your "organization".<br/><br/>Amazon is surely going to address this abuse, the allegations and accusations.  I trust this company and it's ultimate purpose and they do not deserve any of this ridiculous harassment.<br/><br/>Based on the plethora of negative reviews, I will now consider buying the Amazon Fire Phone, because I know Amazon stands behind their product.  I also know that if I am not happy in any way, they will always make it right.<br/><br/>PROOF that Greacepeace is the cause of the negative reviews, due to a flooding campaign by David Pomerantz "Greenpeace USA Senior Energy Campaigner":<br/><br/>us.greenpeace.org/site/TellAFriend?msgId=43061.2<br/><br/>In case Greenpeace removes the page, here is all of the text reply you get after submitting your letter to Jeff Bezos that they wrote for you:<br/><br/>-----------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Friend -<br/><br/>Thank you for telling Amazon's Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos to finally come clean about his company's energy performance and environmental impact. Making this information public is the first step to getting Amazon to clean up its act.<br/><br/>And the more the company hears from its customers, the quicker it will happen. Let's take this to the next level by talking to Amazon in the one language we absolutely know it understands: product reviews!<br/><br/>HELP flood Amazon.com with 1-star reviews for their first ever smartphone, the Amazon Fire.<br/><br/>Why the Fire? The recently released Fire phone's major boast is its unlimited cloud data storage ... but there's a BIG catch. Unlike Apple's iCloud which is powered by 100% renewable energy, Amazon's cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power.<br/><br/>Amazon's Fire's reliance on dirty energy isn't cutting edge, and it's completely unnecessary. Storing our photos, music and messages shouldn't mean we are forced to damage the health of our climate and communities. Apple, Facebook, and Google have figured out how to store our photos and music with renewable energy, and so can Amazon. These reviews will show Amazon that it's time to move to modern energy sources and make a "smarter phone" supported by clean, renewable energy.<br/><br/>Do you have an Amazon.com account? Great! Now, take these TWO easy steps to tell Amazon to shape up:<br/><br/>1) Copy the following review (or just write your own):<br/><br/>It's time to put out the Fire! It makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost. The Fire's reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud is not a strong selling point, especially when competitors like Apple are using 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon can commit to using modern energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.<br/><br/>2) Click HERE to leave a 1-star review on the Amazon Fire Phone product page:<br/><br/>Pssst ... don't forget to click "one" star when you paste your review. And you may need to log into your Amazon.com account first before accessing the review page.<br/><br/>Thank you again for taking action. Time and time again we've seen that your support makes a big difference in getting companies like Amazon to embrace better policies. As an Amazon.com customer, it's important they hear from you directly.<br/><br/>For a greener internet and future,<br/><br/>David Pomerantz<br/>Greenpeace USA Senior Energy Campaigner<br/><br/>-----------------------------------------------------------
Well, first thanks for delivering a day before the promised date.  Worked perfectly out of the box.  I have read a lot of the prerelease reviews of this phone and think that the reviewers have generally got it wrong,  This is a super phone,  Most reviewers complain that the Amazon aps are limited.  I have sideloaded, Waze, the Mircosoft Office Mobile Ap, Lync 2013, Parrot Audio,NY Times and others using backup and copy .apk files from Samsung note 3, to desktop to Firephone without any difficulty.  When I got the phone I fully charged it and easily installed office exchange email and calendar as well as a personal IMAP email and downloaded with USB connection 8 gigs of music.  Every thing works perfectly and I had about 9 hours of continuous use and it had 25% left.  The integration with Amazon functions is suburb and I did not have to do anything to get books, magazines and other content on to the pone.  Voice quality is terrific and Skype works perfectly. The messaging application is terrific and the integration with facebook and twitter is excellent. I think it is a winner and without all the bloatware of Samsung phones is more useful.  And some have said that the speech to text application is minimal.  I don't get it, I dictated three or four emails and the translation to text was instantaneous and accurate. I also tested upload and download speeds and it is faster than any phone I have had on both wifi and ATT. And finally the camera is excellent, and the firefly application really works. So, early days but I am really satisfied. Nice Job Amazon.
Best mobile device I own. Perfect for anyone invested in Amazon Prime, but it also has a truckload of features that all work together seamlessly.  I am a retired QA guy.. I test devices and software. I have read all the negative hype about the phone. I already have 4 other kindle devices, plus ios and windows tablets. I bought the phone for 199 with a 1 year prime deal, so effectively it cost me 99 dollars.  The more I used it , the less I used all my other devices. As I use all the primes services a lot ( music, movies , 2 day shipping) I liked how all these melded together well. The phone feels really well made, and everything gels .. more so than in prior kindle devices. It has a lot of unique features that just add to the experience. Dynamic Perspective is one. Now every screen feels alive. no more rows of little icon graphics. things tilt and move. Take Reading, You can now use all the known features, plus you can set it to autoscroll book pages based on your eye position and the tild of the device. It works well and just makes one feel you are using a very special device. Or one can use the flip option to see the left and right pages that are offscreen. Every app seems to have been rewritten to utilze all these features. It has 32gb of memory.. I never fill up the device.. and that alone would cost a few 100 more. It has Firefly a very cool function allowing one to scan anything and see price and where to get the item etc. Or on device Mayday support.. Free Prime music streaming is the best I have heard with the improved dolby audio, to a point where I can hear subtle sounds on this device ( like high hat sounds on the drummers brushes ) where I can not hear these on other devices. It has this way of loading everything really fast. You can zip in and out of different apps with a swipe. they load and run perfectly , no wait time .. In terms of getting google apps on there it couldnt be simpler. Go to settings., allow non amazon app installs. Go to any google store from the device and install maps  gmail or whatever ..easy peasy. no rooting , warranty issues . The camera is 13mp on back. takes really detailed images plus you can take vine like 'lenticular' images or generate really wide panoramic images automatically . Very impressed with it. Not sure what else.. The OS is just perfect really. great notifications systems and options. Even has miracast built in  ( a superior chromecast predecessor) which allows you to send your screen to an enabled device. I read novels on my large screen tv for example ;).. I am sure I have forgotten things, but 3 weeks in now,. I decided it had become the only device I use , it does everything I want in a superior way.. Not sure why it is getting such a bad press. but I highly recommend it for the prime user.
I am an avid Amazon "person." I have been a Prime member for years, my family purchases products from Amazon frequently, and we have multiple Kindles in our home. In short, we love Amazon. I REALLY wanted to love the Amazon Fire phone. My husband checked it out at AT&T; and came home and told me he was sure that I WOULD love it. I went the very next day to obtain the Fire. At first, I was giddy. The phone was a decent size and felt sturdy in my hands. The screen was vibrant and crisp - and BOY that Dynamic view was incredible. I showed it to everyone - even if they weren't interested!<br/><br/>The first few days were spent learning about my new awesome phone. Sure, there were some apps I wanted that weren't available (transitioning from a Nokia Lumia Windows 8 Phone, which I loved, and previously had the ole IPhone 4.) Strangely, there were no emoticons available for text messaging (an elementary feature these days, wouldn't you think?) The auto scroll feature was a bit iffy at times (way too fast most of the time but, to be fair, I didn't bother trying to figure out if I could slow it down through some setting somewhere.) The camera is ok - nothing to write home about after having had the Nokia Lumia 1020 - but it is fine. I was used to being able to click anywhere on the screen to snap a photo, so it would have taken a little bit to get used to having to click the button at the bottom of the screen instead. Where the heck is the back button? Oh, there is none. You have to swipe up to go back. Well, ok then. So far, the battery life has been my biggest concern because it's horrendous and I have had to keep it on a charger pretty much most of the time!<br/><br/>Flicking the phone to either side to bring up either the menu (left) or additional information (right) worked pretty flawlessly for me. Watching videos and listening to music was great. I loved being able to drag and drop from my PC to phone without having to sync it with a program! It paired effortlessly via bluetooth to my vehicle (although it would not automatically play my music when turning on my vehicle when my previous phone did - and that became an irritation for me) and wireless headphones. The Firefly feature was pretty neat too, but I don't really see the need to use that very often.<br/><br/>I think I could pretty much live with the flaws I had noticed so far...no smart phone has it all, right?<br/><br/>Then, after a few days of playing with and learning my new awesome phone, I realized the battery life wasn't getting any better. I had erroneously assumed that my using the phone so much was the culprit in the dismal battery life. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. Once I had my phone set up the way I wanted and was using it normally, the battery continued to rapidly lose it's charge, and take an extremely long time to charge back up. Now overnight, when I was sleeping and the room was dark - it charged fine. When I woke up it was at 100%. An hour and half later it was sitting at about 55%. You could literally watch it tick down percent by percent. I wasn't actively USING it. I may check my email quickly or hope on Facebook for 5 mins but then set it down. Well - we can't keep our phones on a charger all day, can we? Exactly one week after getting my beautiful new Fire, I went back to AT&T; thinking that I have just gotten a defective phone. It just won't hold a charge at all. They told me if you just turn off the dynamic view feature, the battery will hold the charge much better. Well - that is the biggest feature of this new fancy phone - right? The feature that is bringing in the crowds? I thought about it for about 5 seconds and said no thanks. Coupled with my other observations, just no. Sorry, Amazon. Maybe in a few years when you've worked out some kinks and upgraded that battery I might give it another try.
This review is coming from a first time smartphone owner, so take from this what you will. Before upgrading to the Fire Phone I had only been used to using slide and basic touch screen phones. The thing about my previous phone annoyed me was its lack of immediate response when I used the touch screen. Right off the bat upon opening up my Fire Phone I noticed how precise and responsive the touch screen and motion cameras were. The apps are very nice, but at least for right now there is not a "huge" selection compared to the amounts I saw at looking on other smartphones, but thats to be expected for a new device and there is definitely more than enough to find one that meets your needs.<br/><br/>The Dynamic Cameras: The built in motion cameras are just plain fun. They dynamic perspective is definitely an enjoyable feature that I hadn't witnessed in other smart phones currently out there.<br/><br/>13MP Camera: The photos I have taken are wonderful, crisp, and clear. Something that my previous 2MP camera phones were severely lacking.<br/><br/>The Audio/Speakers: Probably the best digital audio I have heard from any mobile device.<br/><br/>The Screen: The screen is crystal clear HD 1080p, and looks great especially when watching Netflix or Amazon Prime movies. The screen and phone are also fairly large, so watching any kind of tv show or movie is great.<br/><br/>Firefly: Definitely the most fun feature about the Fire Phone. I spent hours after opening it up, just scanning anything and everything around my house to see if it recognized phone numbers, barcodes, even things like movie posters and books. It recognized pretty much everything I threw at it.<br/><br/>Battery Life: It's not the best I've ever had but it's definitely not the worst. I leave my phone on all day, and play pandora in the car to and from my office. Use 4G to browse youtube, facebook, twitter, etc. After having it at 100% at 6am the battery would be at around 30-45% at around 10pm. Obviously if you are watching movies all day on it, the battery will drain much faster.<br/><br/>Negative: The only negative thing about the Fire Phone for me, was ringtone customization. It was very confusing on how to go about downloading ringtones onto the phone. After browsing the app store I found the apps I needed to make ringtone customization work. But I feel like this should have been a basic feature that should not have needed additional app downloads to make work.<br/><br/>Overall Opinion: I think this phone is a great new addition to the world of smartphones. It still has some growing up to do, but has great potential and innovation for future Fire Phone models. I give Fire Phone an 8/10, would Fire Phone again.
Ok. So I have been a faithful Apple customer and have had an iPhone since 2007 when they first came out. I have an apple TV, ipods, and ipads as well. I have all of these devices linked together, so when it came time to upgrade my phone, switching to something else was a big deal. I had been bored with the iPhone and I have been a huge fan of Amazon for some time which made me very eager to try the Fire Phone. I have had the phone for almost a month now and have been for the most part very pleased. Its a beautiful phone, very sleek and elegant. You can see how well its made, I am very impressed. The operating system to me was a good medium between the IOS I have been used to and the android system I had no idea how to use. I was also quite impressed how days after I had gotten the phone and was not happy with the battery life, a software update was released to help and improve this. It really made a difference for me. The only complaints I have with my Fire phone is that when I use the quick launch camera button there are times when the camera loads but you have no display. Why have a quick launch button to capture a moment and the camera fails. This "loading" issue has also happened with my keyboard. I had been typing in my search engine when a call came in, when I went back to the browser the keyboard was missing but if I pushed down it was still typing. I had to restart my phone for the keyboard to come back.<br/>Aside from these randomly glitches, the Fire phone is a very well made phone that has so much potential to be one of the best smart phones out there. I think a little more time sorting out the software bugs will make me stick with amazon. Also, google apps would be nice!
I'll be brief and simple. I'm loving the phone so far, unboxed the package just a few minutes ago.<br/><br/>I've also just used the Help feature and got through to a tech within seconds. That was an awesome tool.<br/><br/>Now, here's something that you - Amazon (or the developers, coders) may want to work on. And it's such a HUGE help and feature to have on the Calendar.<br/><br/>On the "Where" part, you know, where you put the location of the event, Please update/ patch the app to where it is clickable and automatically opens up the default Maps app, that way the user can automatically be navigated to the location.<br/><br/>Very simple addition, but extremely extremely extremely helpful (as I was explaining to Libertie - the tech rep). And it's not like the feature is not already existing.. Fire Phone just has to have it for business people with several lines of daily agenda, instead of copying and pasting that line to the Maps app. That's a loss of precious time and not to mention a safety concern when you're on the road.<br/><br/>There. Add that, and Fire will be more awesome.
I'm a fairly avid Android user, and I have to say this is by far one of the worst experiences I've had on android. Where to start?<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Dynamic perspective is interesting but pointless<br/><br/>Year of Amazon Prime!<br/><br/>Free application every day.<br/><br/>Maybe the firefly feature, never found a use for it though.<br/><br/>I can call someone on it.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Battery life is terrible when using the phone<br/><br/>Requires you to jump through hoops to install "regular" android applications<br/><br/>Has few worthwhile applications on Amazon App Store (This may or may never change)<br/><br/>Silk is a terrible and un-intuitive browser with limited functionality that I had on Chrome (hint: swipe right to get to an actual menu)<br/><br/>Application Management is terrible; Settings > Applications > Manage Applications > Running/Cached to be able to kill running applications. Which really sucks because some applications will apparently chew through mobile data. Even on WiFi I have been running significantly more data than I did with my previous phone with similar behavior.<br/><br/>Applications seem to eat mobile data (see above)<br/><br/>Music App is terrible; refused to sync to my amazon music library, had to transfer music manually from computer.<br/><br/>Can be difficult to get to your applications from "home screen." You have to swipe up, and it will sometimes not register, I've sat looking like an idiot for 3+ minutes trying to get this thing to get to the application I wanted to get to.<br/><br/>HDR mode takes forever to get a picture. Unless you are taking a picture of a painting, you're better off just using any other cellphone camera. Even taking a picture of a picture you will likely get some blur.<br/><br/>Lock Screen functionality is practically non-existent. No matter how any times I set my lockscreen to either a picture or another dynamic lock screen and select "never rotate" the screen will rotate about every 2-4 hours. Honestly, it's a small software bug, but I find this personally the most annoying part of this phone.<br/>The only lockscreen worthwhile, anyway, is the moon one, the rest look like garbage (personal opinion)<br/><br/>When I go to unlock, phone constantly goes into camera mode without me pressing the camera buttons<br/><br/>In Summary:<br/><br/>I really really wish I had never gotten this phone. Perhaps with a significant amount of software patching some of these issues can be addressed, but hey, the battery will always be terrible for my model, so don't expect to go anywhere for more than half a day if you are using this thing with any sort of regularity.<br/>I honestly thought Amazon could do well breaking into the tech market, considering their other successes. I was very wrong. Don't be me.
Really like this phone. No annoying AT&T; apps. Does everything I need it to do.<br/><br/>Update: Phones' game features are really nice with the dynamic perspective. Collections can be added to phone, in contrast to what others reviewers stated. Phone is fast and smooth and battery life is far better than my previous androids. Phone battery last much longer than my other phones in standby. Phone message function very nice and easy to use. Back button is handy and easy to use. I prefer not to use the swivel function, it is too sensitive. Phone does get warm during use, but not horrible. Not the app selection that android has but there is plenty useful apps available.<br/><br/>Update Battery @ 100%:<br/>Talk 7 hrs using 4G<br/>Internet 3.5 hrs, much longer when using wifi<br/>3D games 2.1 hours<br/>GPS 1.5 hours<br/>Radio 8 hrs<br/><br/>Nice feature Update: I believe most phones have this now but the emergency warning feature went off before the tornado sirens during a recent storm.
Cloud storage should be run with 100% renewable energy. This device does not meet this criteria, not even close, it is therefore going to contribute to massive increases in global warming and pollution through the burning of fossil fuels.<br/>For the sake of our planet and our children I would not recommend this gadget!
Although I put only four stars, it's closer to five: like 4.62. I'm used to the Fire technology because of Kindle, so I find it much more user friendly than an iPhone or Samsung. I only have two complaints: the music and the max volume. I have an Amazon cloud with several albums in it, but my phone won't allow me to listen to anything unless I'm connected to WiFi even after I've downloaded the songs to my device. This might be user error. I'm probably missing some crucial step. As for the volume, it doesn't go high enough, especially on speaker phone, unless you use the headphones that came with it. My son has to use speaker phone when calling his grandmother, so this can be a bit inconvenient. Still, everything else is amazing. I can carry my library in my pocket. (The Kindle is a wonderful device, but not pocket-friendly.) Also, I always receive my calls and texts -- nothing is getting dropped like with my old, non-smart phone.
Apple uses 100% renewable energy for their data centers??? Really??? In what planet???<br/><br/>PSA: they're committed to using 100% renewable "clean" energy, which is not the same as they using 0 (zero) dirty energy.<br/><br/>I'm only writing this because it's unfair to make uninformed judgments on a company like this on an issue separate from the product. Sure, Amazon should commit to using more renewable energy, but it's not fair to say companies like Apple use 100% renewable (or clean) energy.<br/><br/>Read the report to find out more about data centers and the energy they use. http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/Global/usa/planet3/PDFs/clickingclean.pdf
I love this phone. All the people out there with negative reviews seem to not understand how to use it. It took a day or two to learn how to flip it and such to get all the functionality down and now it is awesome. I don't know if people are just not trying to like it or what. Dynamic perspective seems to be something they gripe about, but of course it isn't going to be for every app because it is still an android-based phone. Right now it is mainly just the maps that use it but that isn't Amazon's fault. When more app developers make apps with dynamic perspective it will be really cool.<br/>The camera is great, the fact that it syncs with my other devices is really convenient, it loads things fast and features like auto-scroll come in handy. The only thing I would like is a longer battery life, but it charges so fast that that really isn't an issue.<br/>Seriously, give this phone a chance, don't listen to all the haters out there who give it a bad review and tout praises for the iPhone and Samsung whatevers. It's Amazon's first shot at something that could develop into something big. If you love you kindle fire like I do, you will love this phone!
Every phone has flaws.  Every one uses their phone differently.  These phones are designed for the masses, not for each of us individually.  Nice phone.<br/><br/>As for the 1 Star reviews...just read them.  Somebody or some group spammed the review section.  If you read enough of them, you will see they repeat themselves.  The activists who wrote them no doubt drive electric cars and recycle everything...including their reviews.  What's really funny is the number of people who found these fake reviews helpful.<br/><br/>This may not be the best phone out there, but kudos to Amazon for allowing the fake reviews to stay up.
WOW! got my new phone yesterday. After all the bad reviews here is one that will help everyone out. Do not compare it to any other phone because it is New refreshing and totally what I was looking for.<br/> Easy activation as far as the setup and customizations when I get a phone the book goes away and I go at it.<br/>Customizations:<br/>Preinstalled applications<br/>1.)Firefly is a great concept it works great with everything I have used it on so far. I am able to add business cards straight into my contacts as well as web pages you can not go wrong here better then the old way of give me a minute to add you to my contacts just snap and there is all the info needed. you can also find names of songs in a flash maybe you heard it before and can not remember the title with this easy to use app point and it does the work for you same for TV shows and movies. Oh yeah there was a separate app you had to install before that was harder to use but no need for that with the Fire Phone<br/>2.)The My notebook app is a great idea you don't need to add or install a note app because this is already there for you.You can keep notes ongoing and add them as favorite so you don't worry where it was or is they are right there. I can see only one improvement for this it would be great if it had check box so you could mark as completed. I have put Appointments a grocery list Movies to buy or watch. As well as a to do list and calls to make. I also can add a note for all current medications so they are with me always and up to date. There is no need for a separate app to do this  all these are accessible at the touch of a finger.<br/>3.) I use office suite pro to keep a working live Diabetes monitor to keep my numbers so it gets rid of the extra apps and very easily lost record books. I have it all right there for my doctors to review in a flash. I have tried other apps to keep track of this but they are not what I personally wanted so I created my own on my home pc and transferred it to a doc usable on my phone<br/>4.) You can put everything where you want it in groups that you name excellent idea to let the user name the groups they want Thanks Great job!<br/>5.) Lets talk about the wallet or loyalty card keeper app. WOW! I use to have  a separate app download to do this that cost money to store more then 10 cards if I needed to add more cards well I had to buy more space.<br/>6.)Games love the little buddy on the My Monkey buddy app/game just for goofing off with its cute as well as entertaining!<br/><br/>7.) As a prime user I am in love with the preinstalled apps Got rid of my Pandora app because Prime music is a much nicer way to listen to streaming music it has what I want to hear and when. No extra fees for no commercials. Seamlessly lets your calls come thru and it pauses your tunes for you till you are done with the call.<br/>8.)Email control, calendars ,notes docs and more. So easy no extra apps needed.<br/>9.)  Lock screen can be customized  the only improvement I could see here is more places that 3d screens could be found but this is no fault of the phones, just not many places have this so it makes this new phone ahead of the times!<br/>10.)Sound quality great and the ear buds that came with the phone are comfortable easy to hang around your head with out worry of loosing them. Phone calls are clear as if the person is in the same room as you.<br/>So all the bad reports you have heard well they really did not want a new phone they wanted a copy of the phone they had then it is the wrong choice they made. I can not wait to see what the next model does very excited just like having a tablet with you in this case a kindle.<br/> If you want something fresh and a great buy the Fire Phone is all for you!If you want what you are use to don't buy it just to give it negative reviews. LOVE MY PHONE! please feel free to comment and like or not like my review!!
Soon after I got this phone I was like meh.  But then I began to like it more and more.  Leaving out the $99 prime bonus and lack of Google Play (more later) and focusing on the amazon phone itself, here are pros and cons I see:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>1. Everything used in phone appears to be top quality.  No cutting corners on LCD display, cameras, etc.<br/>2. Dynamic Perspective is fun and they provide a new screen daily.  Some cheesy and some amazing.<br/>3. Nice included accessories.<br/>4. Firefly works well for most consumer products.<br/>5. Navigation is easy.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>1. Gestures and navigation is a bit messy.  I once had the flashlight be on and was getting all sorts of things openning without a way to turn it off.<br/>2. Bad battery life.  Mine is plugged into my computer often and I'm lucky I can do that. Or you have to make sure it is fully charged before starting the day.<br/>3. The Silk browser is great but some websites can trap you.  Biggest offender is Yahoo Answers website where it can keep removing the popup navigation buttons.<br/>4. The camera focuses well and works all the time, except when you take screenshots of another phone's screen.  It looks great until you take the pic and it blurs it right before the picture.  It is also slower to take pictures than other phones i've used.<br/>5.  The navigation software has issues.  For one think it seems like almost any touch you do cancels out navigation and you have to start it again, and it can happen silently, so you don't know it has stopped guiding you; something that you don't want while driving and being guided.<br/><br/>Now, I'm going with assumption 2 can be improved by changing settings and future software and Amazon will improve 3 and 4 and 5 as well in new releases.<br/><br/>The big deciding factor might be Google Play.  I kind of like having better selection (even if subset of) software when I search for some.  They've all been reviewed by Amazon and a lot of the junk you see in other stores aren't here.  And big games I was looking for were all there so for me Amazon app store was better choice than Google play app store on this phone.<br/><br/>All in all, good phone which I would only recommend if you can keep fully charged during work or over night.
Two week review:<br/>The Good: As a consumer of Amazon services and devices, this phone was the logical choice for me. I didn't expect access to Google play, as I've owned other Amazon devices and was already familiar with the interface. This phone fits well into the existing Amazon ecosystem with a familiar though enhanced interface.<br/><br/>I've been pleasantly surprised by my experience with the phone. The form factor is near perfect. The Amazon app store is excellent. Integration into existing Amazon services is beautiful. With the latest software update battery life is good. The features are surprisingly well executed and integrated into the interface. There should be good potential for developers to integrate dynamic perspective into apps, particularly games. The camera is very good and nicely integrated. Audio was up to my expectations for a device of this size. I've used Firefly most days, finding it most useful for identifying music. Taken as a whole, Amazon services and device, I doubt that there is a better deal.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/>Initially, battery life was unexceptional. The phone gets warm under high demand(not hot). The much complained about lack of Google services is a fact. The AT&T; service restrictions are annoying.<br/><br/>Resolution:<br/>Recent software updates have improved upon battery life. I've learned to use the features of the interface more efficiently, thus wasting fewer battery resources. The phone doesn't seem to warm up as much. Maybe I don't notice it or maybe software updates have reduced resource waste. I don't feel tied down by the need to charge the device. I've sideloaded the Google apps I really want(Chrome), there are good equivalents for others. There are other sources besides Google play for most apps that aren't available though the Amazon app store. So far, AT&T; service has been acceptable, time will tell.<br/><br/>Comparison: Device history, Samsung Galaxy S3, Samsung Galaxy Tablet, Kindle Fire HDX, Kindle Paperwhite with keyboard. Admittedly this is a limited set of devices, I don't usually early adopt. The interface is superior to either of the Samsung devices and comparable to the HDX with enhancements. The interface is uncluttered and has a nice layout. The reader is comparable to the HDX. I prefer to set up the reader on both devices to black background with white text, while the E-ink interface of the Paperwhite is preferable with white background to reduce eye strain.<br/><br/>Conclusion: If like me, you prefer Amazon services for Kindle over the  Google equivalents, this phone should be considered. If you use Amazon Prime Services for steaming, this phone should be considered. If you are in the market to upgrade from a flip phone to a smart phone, consider this phone. If you are highly tied into the Google ecosystem, you will be disappointed.
DISCLAIMER: I do not own this phone. I am only giving this 5 stars to balance out the spam reviews.<br/><br/>It is ironic and funny that these environmentals spamming the reviews of this phone with their environmentalist views are causing Amazon to consume more of the very same energy they are decrying. It DOES take more energy to host and serve these reviews. You do know that, right?<br/><br/>To the environmentalist spammers:<br/>Reduction of the impact of human activity on our planet is certainly an admirable goal, but spamming Amazon's reviews will probably do nothing more than get your reviews taken down. The review section of Amazon is not your personal soap box, and I really doubt Jeff Bezos is going to end up reading any of these.<br/>If you want to send a message to Jeff Bezos about dirty energy usage, I would recommend you actually find some contact information for the corporate office of Amazon and send messages there.
First of all, would you hipster morons from Apple stop posting one-star reviews because the phone is "environmentally unfriendly." You are not reviewing the phone at all..<br/><br/>On to the actual phone:<br/><br/>Pros<br/>1) New technology like firefly is very handy in identifying/pricing music, TV, etc.<br/>2) Great picture quality with camera<br/>3) Wonderful integration into the Amazon ecosystem<br/>4) Mayday offers great customer service<br/>5) Price = $.99!!!<br/>6) Works excellent as an actual phone<br/>7) Solid build.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>1) OS can be a little confusing coming from IOS or ANDROID<br/>2) Specs could be better for a new phone.<br/>3) Mediocre Battery life.<br/>4) Limited Amazon Appstore<br/><br/>Overall, i like this this phone a lot and have no regrets leaving my iPhone 4S behind. I do not work for Amazon, but love their convenience and customer service. I feel that most of the negative reviews are because of people being unfamiliar with their OS and the "environmentally unfriendly" claims. Excellent phone with the pros far outweighing the cons.
I brought my college freshman daughter in to the AT&T; store to upgrade her old phone (an iPhone 3GS, still going strong but lacking capabilities), and I was sure she'd beg for an iPhone 6. But no; after testing display phones for an eternity, it was the Fire Phone that captivated her. She found navigating through its features intuitive, she loved the camera, enjoyed the sample games, and was sold by the free unlimited cloud storage for photos.  The new price was right and we are on contract anyway. I was so afraid we'd get a troublesome unit, but so far so good! I wouldn't call her extremely tech-savvy, but she hasn't needed to use the May Day button yet.  Her current game obsession on the Fire is Monument Valley. Here's hoping it doesn't distract her from her coursework! :)  I'll update if she experiences problems with the phone, but at this point she would highly recommend it.
I wanted to like this phone, I really did. I have owned every Kindle from the original grayscale unit through the fire to the fire 7 inch HDX that I now own. I've never had a problem with any of them!  But this phone is too unpredictable for me. You see, I live on the road. I spend three weeks out of every month on the road plying my trade and I cannot do that with an unreliable telecommunications product.  This phone freezes up on me on almost a daily basis and I have had to perform five soft reset on this phone in the past two weeks! I do love the mayday system but it's not enough to make up for the Issues this phone has.  When I spoke to the AT&T; representative about getting a refund I compared this phone to my iPhone.  This is perhaps an unfair comparison given that the iPhone has been around for seven years and the fire phone has been around for less than a month. Given enough time, the fire phone might be somewhere near is good as the iPhone but not yet!<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/>  When I wrote the above review the phone was only exhibiting an annoying tendency toward unreliability.  However, since that time this phone has become an absolute nightmare!  This phone freezes up a MINIMUM of once a day and the only way to revive it is to reset the unit.  The Bluetooth connection keeps dropping out, no matter what device I have it paired with!  As I mentioned above, I am constantly on the road which means I never know how to get around and I need the GPS, but with it going silent without any warning I get lost all the time.  I cannot believe Amazon would put it's name on a product which is so painfully unprepared for the rigors of everyday use.  I feel it necessary to reiterate that I have owned every Kindle that has yet come out and I have NEVER had close to this number of problems with any of them!  The iPhone may not offer access to amazon prime (without a special app), feature a sexy 3D display, or expand the limits of consumer spending abilities with a nifty product identification feature, but it has the decency to work all the time!
Love the phone. Very user friendly.
Love this phone.  Great camera!!
I love this phone! I have had Nokia, Ericsson, Motorola, and iPhones. My last cell phone was a Samsung (and my favorite of the bunch) and I was really happy with it. I had it for three years and was about to upgrade to a newer Samsung model when Amazon announced their new cell phone. I have loved the Kindle products - readers and tablets - I have had and after reading about the new Kindle Fire cell phone, I pre-ordered one. I couldn't wait for it to arrive. From the moment I took it out of the box and charged it up, I was delighted and excited about my new phone.<br/><br/>The camera is stellar! The apps (which are abundant) for the phone have worked seamlessly. I have had no difficulties placing or receiving calls and the reception is as good as, if not better, than my Samsung. The signal strength varies, as it does on any cell phone, but it has been better than any cell phone I've had previously, including the Samsung. The screen is large and the display is top-quality - it is a pleasure to watch movies, videos, and TV shows. The Facebook, Mail, Instagram, Twitter and other social media apps are easy to use and their design is pleasing to the eye and the mind. The battery life is splendid! I have never had a phone with a battery life even comparable to this one. What a complete joy that has been! The operating system is very user friendly as well as mentally stimulating. The graphics are mind-blowing. The Dynamic Perspective is mesmerizing. The performance of the phone is powerful and fast. Firefly is a blast to use. And having the Mayday feature is reassuring should I ever need it. (The Mayday feature is an excellent way of contacting Amazon Support. I have not had to use it for the phone but I have used it on my tablet. The Mayday feature beats any other way of contacting support personnel - nothing compares.) The Dolby audio is phenomenal! I have no complaints. I'm not saying it is the perfect phone, but it has been the perfect phone for me, from the day I got it.<br/><br/>In looking through the reviews, I was blown away by the sheer number of one star reviews. I read many of them and can only conclude Apple devotees have gone to great measures to review-bomb the Amazon Fire Phone. I wonder how many of those individuals have created multiple Amazon accounts expressly for the purpose of review-bombing this product? How very sad that is. The reviews read like "copy and paste" material and I am surprised that Amazon even allows those people to post such "sour-grapes" and infantile reviews. Reviews, which, in fact, are not even reviews of the Amazon Fire Phone, but gripes referring to the environment and other non-product criticism.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend the Amazon Fire Phone to anyone who wants a great cell phone! And... it's just plain fun to use!<br/><br/>UPDATE 11-30-14:<br/>From reading reviews of the Amazon Fire Phone I discovered many of the 1 star reviews were a result of Greenpeace requesting people to post 1 star reviews, en masse. Here is the link to Greenpeace's webpage:<br/>http://us.greenpeace.org/site/MessageViewer?dlv_id=0&em;_id=43321.0
The overall Fire Phone is Great, which keeps my star rating at a Four in light of the Extreme price decrease. New purchasers should take advantage.<br/><br/>This phone is easy to use and I had no problems transferring my contacts, music and photos from my iPhone. I received detailed instructions for how to do this after purchasing the Fire Phone.<br/><br/>I agree with another reviewer that the power button is difficult to maneuver, especially with a bumper guard on. And it could be in a handier place.<br/><br/>Picture quality is Excellent. I don't even take my regular camera with me anymore. All pictures are stored in my Amazon cloud with unlimited storage. Sweet! Being able to access the camera even with a locked screen is very handy, however having the same button access Firefly, which opens at least half the time I'm trying to take a quick picture, can be a real hassle. At least it is easy to toggle between the camera and Firefly. To be noted, the camera drains the battery pretty quickly which can be a downer when using it on vacation. The upside is that you don't ever have to worry about running out of picture storage space.<br/><br/>Firefly is fast and handy, especially when I want to know what a song is, playing on the radio. It is a lot easier and a lot faster than my SoundHound searches with my iPhone 4s. Also, checking for the Amazon price on items I find in the store can be a real money saver. I Love the Firefly feature.<br/><br/>The fact you can only access the Amazon pool of apps is limiting. I hope this is something which will be fixed. I really miss my Sleep Time and Starbucks apps.<br/><br/>Mayday is easy, fast and helpful. Mayday = Customer service at it's best.<br/><br/>The Sound Quality is good and volume for phone calls and music is great. I do have a problem hearing my phone ring and almost never hear it when I receive a text, so these volumes could be improved upon. Transferring my old ringtone would be nice, but with the app issue I have yet to figure this out.<br/><br/>The 3D screen is awesome but how about some new home screens to choose from?<br/><br/>The Fire Phone vibrates ever so slightly in your hand while typing which I find extremely cool. It makes using my phone more fun. It's like playing a video game while I'm doing everyday things. You can turn this feature off if it bothers you.<br/><br/>I agree with others that the Fire phone does get pretty hot with use. But I'm not sure how unusual this is compared to other 4G smart phones.<br/><br/>Now for the kick-in-the-pants. The reason for not giving Five stars.<br/>Those of us who went ahead and bought the newfangled, un-tested Fire Phone right out of the gate, instead of waiting for the new iPhone 6, either paid or are paying full price for the Fire. If we'd just waited for the iPhone 6 release, we could now get  the same great Fire Phone for $0.99. REALLY???<br/>I suppose I may have just decided to stay with an iPhone since the Fire phone reviews have been subpar, but then I'd be missing out on a pretty great phone. At the time of purchase, I already knew Amazon would stand behind their product and would provide excellent customer service and felt good about the choice. And I like the Fire Phone more than my iPhone 4s, but the difference in price is Astronomical! Money is tight, so this price difference is more than a little aggravating. And the worst part is that I'll get to simmer about it for the next two years of my contract. Not cool.
Fire Phone is a big disappointment. Here are the main issues I’ve faced:<br/>- The device costs as iPhone 5S and Samsung Galaxy S5, but its technical parameters are 30% lower.<br/>- My initial  experience: I paid for it $649 taking it without a plan because I travel a lot and I need to change SIMs. Eventually, I discovered that "Without a plan" doesn't mean unlocked (which is the case with Apple iPhone). So, I had to ask a friend with AT&T; plan to request AT&T; for the unlock code. That was very, very annoying and why the hell I had to go through this if I can get the code for free?<br/>- FireOS. It is cool, BUT it doesn’t work with Google PlayStore and at the same time Amazon Appstore supports a lot less apps than PlayStore. So, if I need an app,  I have to download .apk from PlayStore on my PC, move it to my FirePhone and install it. Why do I have to do all this? It would be much easier simply Amazon to give access to PlayStore<br/>- Google Apps such as Drive, Youtube, gmail etc are restricted for FirePhone and I still don’t find a way to find a workaround. THIS IS VERY ANNOING. I use Google apps a lot and I don’t see reason Amazon to keep me away from them. Even Apple (who hate Google bit time) gave access to Google.<br/>- There is no notification for Viber and Whatsapp messages on the top of the screen. Thus, I can’t see if someone has written me a message.<br/><br/>- PROS: good battery life, very good camera and this 3D stuff is nice.<br/><br/>Overall, FirePhone is a flop and I  consider this purchase as a mistake. I will never ever buy Amazon FirePhone unless Amazon change it drastically. The only reason not to return the phone is that right now I am not in the States and the shipping cost is too high.
I think amazon should delete all reviews before Aug 1 to give the phone an even chance. It apperars those early reviewers did not investigate what they were getting.<br/>Folks, this is not an iphone. This is a different phone and I love it. Have had it several weeks now.<br/>Have been a long term iphone user. The iphone was new at one time and no one seems to remember the problems it had. They did not have all the apps that they have now, that takes time and I'm sure Amazon will build up it's apps over time.<br/>I have not had any issues with the battery life and only for the first 2 days did my fire phone get hot.<br/>Yes, I miss some of the apps that I had with my iphone but others things about this phone outweigh that.<br/>I thought long and hard and did investigate both (Fire and Iphone) before switching. There were many pros and cons for both.<br/>I guess the deciding factor was that I know Amazon is still very customer focused and I feel that Apple is now more money focused.<br/>I have a Kindle and have been very satisfied with it. Yes, I am a prime member also. The free year did not win me over because I would have paid for that anyway.<br/>I decided (much to my family and friend's shock) to take a chance on the Fire phone and I am very glad I did.
Let me start by saying that I work as an IT Manager and like to get my hands on the latest and greatest hardware.  My previous two phones were an iPhone and a Windows 8.1 phone.  I was originally very hesitant to even try out the Amazon Fire with the launch price being so high.  I assumed they would launch the phone at a low price to instantly compete with Apple like they have done with their Kindle tablet line, but that wasn't the case.  The price adjustment to 99 cents with a 2 year contract was what sold me on making the leap.  I'm an Amazon Prime user, so getting the year tacked on was a great benefit.  Now, on to the phone itself.<br/><br/>Coming from an iPhone and a Windows 8.1 phone, there was a bit of a learning curve.  I've supported Android phones at work, but this is so customized by Amazon that it doesn't look or function even remotely like any Android phone I've ever used.  One awesome feature that is great for users who have never seen an Amazon Fire Phone before is the video tutorial.  As I powered up the phone for the first time, I was greeted with an interactive video tutorial that walked me through all the features of the phone, the commands and gestures, basically everything someone would need to know to use the phone to the fullest.<br/><br/>I think people who review this phone negatively must have had expectations that it would be either very similar to an iPhone or very similar to an Android phone, but it is neither.  It's its own beast so you have to set those expectations with yourself before you dive in.  That being said, it is a very useful and satisfying beast.  After activation with ATT, I was able to easily setup work and person email accounts, download all the apps I would need from the Amazon App Store.  I was very impressed with the swipe commands on the phone and the added functionality that they give each view.  Dynamic Perspective is a very cool feature on this phone as well.  Aside from its awesome usefulness in the maps application and being able to navigate through cities with ease, I think this feature is more of a bragging rights feature for Amazon, as there aren't a ton of practical uses for it yet that I have seen.  The Firefly feature which is another highly touted feature by Amazon is actually really nice and functions quite well.  I scanned several products with it and was instantly provided with a link to the product information, Amazon links to purchase, options to save for later as well as a few other options.  There are similar apps to Firefly, but Firefly definitely serves its purpose with flair.<br/><br/>My one wish on this phone, as I am an avid user of Amazon Cloud Player (aka Amazon Music) is that it would be easier to look through large libraries of music and download what you want from the cloud.  If the Music app on the Fire Phone was more in line with the Amazon Music app on Windows, it would be wonderful.<br/><br/>All in all, this is the best phone I've used to date for the purposes I require (email, text, social media, music, video, light gaming, navigation).  I setup plenty of people in my office with iPhone 6 devices already, and I would take my Fire Phone over one of those any day.  I definitely prefer the Amazon Fire Phone layout and functionality to that standard Android devices as well.  Amazon has done of great job of customizing the OS.  The way I currently view the mobile devices that I've used:  Fire Phone > iPhone > Standard Android Phones > Windows 8.1 Phones
I love my Fire phone. I've had it for about 2 months now, it has been great and everything on it has operated perfectly so far. I found an easy way to sideload google apps so any app not available from amazon I am still able to get. Even if I couldn't do that, it's not a huge issue for me. The camera is great, and I've used Firefly many times.  Amazon customer service is awesome-- I bought it full price, and when the price dropped, an email to amazon got a me a refund. I don't think it's fair that so many people have posted bad reviews of it without even owning or trying the phone. A "review" is a place for someone who has tried the phone to tell about their experience using it, not for just anyone to post their opinion-- find a forum for that.  And these hundreds of 1 star reviews that suddenly popped up about the dirty energy must be from some kind of organization encouraging people to do so, many of them are almost identical wording. Again-- these are not reviews for the phone itself. Take up your issues with Amazon's business practices elsewhere.
My favorite thing it to push the Firefly button when I hear a song on the radio, and the phone tells me the song and artist. Too cool! I would give this phone 5 stars if I could get my banks app and a few others I miss, and the emojis for texting. This phone is better than the iphone by a longshot. Apple's energy policies are wonderful and I applaud them, but this is not the forum. Please rate the phone itself. I strongly recommend the Fire phone.
Updated review, modified from 1 to 4 stars, 10/24/14. Overall, I am very happy with my Amazon Fire Phone. As an avid Amazon customer and Kindle Fire tablet user, it was a no-brainer for me to try this phone out. Love that Amazon refunded the $200 price difference to me! When priced at $450 ($350, considering the year of the Amazon Prime), it's a good value, compared to the competition.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Easy to use<br/>- Love that I can access my Amazon products (books, music, movies, etc)<br/>- Added plus to receive an extra year membership for my Amazon Prime, $99 value<br/>- Good screen size, w/nice look and feel<br/>- Camera is great<br/>- Love the free Amazon photo cloud storage<br/>- Phone controls are good (like the bottom swipe feature for "back")<br/>- Email easy to install and use<br/>- Dynamic Perspective is cool for game players<br/>- Firefly is useful when I go shopping; just scan barcode for product info or to buy<br/>- Mayday Button to access Customer Service is super (Amazon Customer Service is top notch)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Battery drains a bit fast, but seems to be improving w/system upgrades.<br/>- I had problems w/my initial Fire Phone, about 5 weeks after purchase. It overheated, especially when charging (got HOT, not just warm). Screen started locking up, going black. Had to completely reboot every time it happened. Used Mayday Button/Customer Service 2x. Bought the $650 phone through AT&T; when they first came out, but Amazon stood behind the purchase. Sent me a brand new phone and also gave me a $200 credit (as Amazon gift card).<br/><br/>Note: Amazon first thought the screen protector was causing the screen blacking-out problem, that it was messing up the phone's sensors. I removed the $25 Moshi IVisor AG Screen Protector (which was specific for this phone), but same problem kept occurring. My new phone is working well so far, so I am happy with the Fire Phone purchase.
It's okay.<br/><br/>Pro- It came with several of the apps I use already installed and I was able to install a few others<br/>Con- There are quite a few apps that just aren't available, it seems every time I go to look for a specific app it's not there. Amazon recommends some that are similar, but I close is not close enough.<br/><br/>Pro- I can read books and listen to audio books.<br/>Con- Short of downloading every single book I own and going to the furthest point I've read in each book there is no way for me to mark them as read. On my Kindle I'm able to move the books into folders so I know where I'm at. The android app for audible allows you mark books as finished, I REALLY liked this option for the simple fact that I don't always remember right which books I have and have not read. The Fire Phone does not allow this at this time.<br/><br/>Pro- I can pin the apps I use the most to the Carousel.<br/>Con- It shows every app or book I've opened recently. My internet search history is available for anyone to read if I'm showing them my "cool new phone" which is annoying. I don't have any bad websites, I just would rather it not be "public" information.<br/><br/>Pro- I love being able to push the black button and say "Call (insert someone's name)" or "Text (insert someone's name)".<br/>Con- It doesn't work 100% of the time.<br/><br/>Pro- Fire tricks are cool<br/>Con- This is actually my second Fire Phone, after three weeks of tech support they finally figured out that my Dynamic Perspective wasn't working properly and sent me a new phone. Three weeks. Brand new out of the box phone. But it works on the new phone, it's cook I guess. The Firefly thing is a cool party trick for about 5 minutes.<br/><br/>Pro- Good phone quality, battery life, size<br/>Con- the camera is a little slow but is livable to me<br/><br/>Will I ever buy a Fire Phone again?<br/>I'm going to give this phone a year. It's new so I'm sure Amazon is still working out the kinks and will make some upgrades to the software along the way to improve the phone. Hopefully those improvements will include more and improved apps which is my biggest complaint with this phone so far.
I'm surprised at how much I like this phone. While previous Kindle Fire devices felt somewhat clunky or as though they were missing something, that's not at all the impression I get with the Fire Phone, which I got after giving up my old iPhone. The larger screen size is taking a little getting used to, but really at this point I have no complaints about the software, the battery life, or Internet access.<br/><br/>There are a few things I've figured out that might be useful to others. The first is for Facebook users who would prefer not to have their phone buzz every time or have your data eaten up by the phone constantly checking for updates. Tap the menu button on the right and scroll down to App Settings to turn those things off. That'll help the battery life as well. Next if you'd like to turn of the little recommendations you see underneath carousel items, you can go to Settings>Applications & Parental Controls and select the 4th option to toggle those off.<br/><br/>One last thing I'm really happy to see is that apps are already coming out that take advantage of the Fire's more ambitious features. If you want to have some real fun with Firefly, check out <br/>, which allows you to scan items around the house and keep track of them on your device.
First Disclaimer: I do not own this phone.<br/>I have tested it a few times for performance and design and I have to say, for the first phone, Amazon has done a great job.<br/>Though it could do some update and get more apps ( a similar problem Windows phones face).<br/><br/>Certain problems that occur are the glitches involving the firefly app and just overall small glitches involving the basic tasks from time to time.<br/><br/>Though the main point of the review is this<br/><br/>I find it absolutely absurd how many stupid idiotic one-star "reviews" have been put on this phone.<br/>I thought it was very odd how such a descent phone has been put with this image. So I did some investigation.<br/><br/>99.99999% of the one star reviews are some bulls*** about some stupid "environmentalist" nonsense.<br/>I do not know if Amazon may be using coal to power its servers, but that is not to be discussed about this phone.<br/>I am also certainly not saying "screw the environment" because I believe global warming is humanity's #1 concern.<br/>But, this is the ABSOLUTE most hideously disrespectful way of sending a message. Those of you who have done this,<br/>you are bigger, dirtier piles of waste.
Since this is my first smartphone, I have nothing else to compare it to.  I do realize that you cannot get Google apps, and that is a bummer, would be nice to be able to do so.  I originally "pre-purchased" this phone before it was able to be shipped.  I was so excited, my first smartphone.  Pre-purchase price $200 with 2 year AT&T; contract.  No problem, I already used AT&T; and my contract was up.  Free year of Prime. super.  I already used Prime and they extended my subscription for a year.  Now for the bad news.  After I had my phone for about 1 month, Amazon started advertising the Fire Phone for $.99 with a 2 yr. contract.  Not a happy camper.  Now the good news, I called Amazon ready to do battle over the price I paid.  Amazon was very gracious, credited my account for the $200 without a whimper.  Hooray for Amazon.  Bottom line, I love my phone.  But it is like being with a man for the first time, you have nothing to compare it to.
I love this phone.  If you are an amazon user, you will too.  I have noticed that there are some apps I'd like and can't get from time to time, such as the Hershey Park app, when I was in Hershey Park.  But, overall, this device is very easy to use, and more then covers all of my needs.  The battery life is better then I ever expected too.  I think I got a steal!
When a new iPhone comes out, lines go around the block at the phone store with folks clamoring to buy one. Then everyone likes to show off their new phones and everything they can do. In my own household, each of us couldn't wait for the contract to expire to upgrade to the new thing. Oddly enough, no one in my family ever uses the new features much. Siri is sometimes used for entertainment on long trips, but is about it. I was not happy with the size of the iPhone and had a lot of problems with iTunes. I bought a Samsung S Note2, a disaster for many reasons. Over the course of time, I transferred all of my (remaining) iTunes music to Amazon using the Amazon Importer. I currently have a second generation Kindle.<br/>When Amazon came out with a new phone, I did my homework. I saw the Amazon video, read as many reviews as I could, watched many reviews and tutorials on YouTube. When I bought the Amazon Fire Phone, all of the main things I love about the Amazon Kindle, Amazon Prime, and Amazon Music loaded seamlessly into the Fire Phone. The phone has the 3D effect which is kind of cool to tinker with, Firefly to make purchasing from Amazon easier (which I use as much as possible due to their customer service, reliability, and two day Prime service, and Mayday. I do not have Mayday on my current Kindle. I have already used the Mayday feature, (problem with my account, not phone) The service was exceptional. I think the Mayday feature and extending my Amazon Prime is worth the price of the phone right there.<br/>The Firefly is useful for shopping Amazon and the 3D Effects are fun, but as previous reviewers have stated, the phone really does nothing "new" and there was no reason for Amazon to make this phone. I don't need innovative features, I need a phone that make phone calls, text, play music, play videos, play games in my free time, and organize my life with its various apps. The Amazon Fire Phone does all of that brilliantly. The voice command is simple to use.<br/>Yet people complain. People complain of the heat. It got warm one day: when I kept the lock screen on to watch the 3D animations, but it never got warmer than the Samsun S Note. The battery seems fine (there as an update that supposedly helped), and since I did my homework, it wasn't difficult to master the phone's features.<br/>People complain of the lack of apps. All of my apps from my Samsung are there with a couple of exceptions: Teachers pay Teachers (since I am one), and Dropbox. If these don't get added later, I will certainly live. The wallet feature even made a bar code feature to use in the Star Bucks store since there is no Starbucks app yet. Either way, I would rather have a phone that works and works well.<br/>So far, I love this phone and I highly recommend it. If you want a reliable, dependable, and comfortable fun phone then this is the one for you. Will I show off and brag to my friends? Yes, I already brag and boast as to how well it works.<br/>I am an average person who uses his phone before and after work for entertainment, usefulness, and functionality. I cannot be more thrilled.
I'm not saying it's perfect but it works wonderfully well and the OS is easy to learn.  It's comfortable to hold, feels satisfying in the hand and performs exactly as promised.  I am sick to death of the reviewers who bemoan the so-called lack of apps.  Who needs 1 million apps anyway?  Most of us need only a relatively few.  I was able to find most of the apps I used on my IPhone in the Amazon store or find a comparable replacement.<br/><br/>This is a phone for regular people - especially those of us who shop unapologetically  on Amazon.  Again, I am tired of reviewers who complain about the easy access the Fire phone gives to Amazon, as though it were some sort of evil plot.  Those same reviewers don't seem the least bit worried about how Goggle is systematically stripping all their personal information and selling it to anyone willing to pay.<br/><br/>I have been a fan of Apple products for many years and hesitated to make the switch to the Fire phone.  After a few days with the phone, I have to laugh at my reservations.  I don't miss the IPhone at all!
I think people need to take a deep breath and stop trying to compare this phone to flagship phones from the likes of Samsung and Apple. Considering this is Amazon's first phone it's shockingly good. I've had WAY worse android phones, and in many ways this phone smokes the iphone 4s it replaced. For $199 it really was a stretch, at that price the galaxy would win just because amazon felt the need to stick their own OS on the fire phone. For $0.99 the fire phone is real contender.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- great screen<br/><br/>- more than enough power<br/><br/>- stable<br/><br/>- decent battery life (not too hot when you start watching movies though)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>FIRE OS<br/> - Maps can't search to save its life. IF you know the address, I actually prefer it to google maps, easier alternate routes and the voice guidance actually has nice features (I like it when gps guidance tells me "Exit on random street west and in two miles turn right on another road" rather than ONLY telling my the current step in the route).<br/><br/>- you'll either learn how to sideload or you'll learn to live without most useful apps.<br/><br/>- it feels cheap. If an iPhone 4s felt like a BMW, and the samsung feels more like an audi, this fire phone is a base model corolla... with cloth seats. The thin plastic ridge around the screen is 90% of the "cheap" in my opinion, I actually like the rubberized plastic back quite a bit. The plastic is hard, just tall enough to be obvious, but just small enough to feel like it's only noticeable because it was built to loose tolerances. Like the gap between a car body and the door. It's not so bad as to be uneven, but it IS larger than it should be. If it were metal and wider (or flush with the screen, either would work) this phone would feel twice as expensive.<br/><br/>- The speaker is useless. Seriously try watching a movie or listening to music without headphones, it's muddy and annoying.<br/><br/>Long story short, it nails most of the core functionality but lacks polish. I expect the second iteration to be a home run.
I've now had my phone for a little over 10 weeks and I'm truly pleased with it.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Geared towards Amazon products...I use Amazon for most everything so this works well for me.<br/>Integrated email - I have 6 accounts and the phone gives me the option to combine into one inbox instead of using multiple apps.<br/><br/>Excellent Display<br/>Fantastic Camera<br/>Great sound<br/>Firefly<br/>Outstanding Map and Directions<br/>Silk Browser<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Still a lot of android apps unavailable...a lot.<br/>Speed Dial is not a feature with the phone (I.e. Press and hold down #2 to dial someone)<br/>No voicemail notifier...very, very easy to miss the fact you have voicemails<br/><br/>I'm a fan and think Amazon has done a great job with this product!
I love my Amazon Fire.  I had been so loyal to Apple and I Phones in the past, but needed something updated and new.  I love it!  The fact that it uses Fossil Fuels, like coal and gas which keeps millions of people employed makes me love it even more.  Love the apps, camera, and all features.  So glad I purchased this device!
Don`t know what people a whining about. Best phone I have had in the close to 20 years I have been using cell phones. Great pictures and interesting opening pages. More apps than I will ever use. Price was great at .99 cents. And a year extra of prime. Alot of the features remind me of my kindle fire. So it was easy to get used to using. Transfer from my old iphone was a breeze. Rock on Amazon!
I just don't get all the negative reviews,  truly I don't.  I LOVE THIS THING.<br/><br/>It's a GREAT phone, I love the gadgets (you don't have to use 'em but they are easy).<br/><br/>I like the size, the heft, the speed, it's a great device and that's a fact.<br/><br/>Buy it for .99 when you upgrade your phone on ATT.  That's what I did and it worked out very well, thank you so much.<br/><br/>Pay little heed to the naysayers you phone folk.  You'll love it just as I do.
UPDATE 9/16/14:<br/>I was an excited early adopter of the Fire Phone and gave it 4 stars initially, but have updated my review to reflect my current opinion.  I will leave my initial review below.  The reasons I have changed my review is primarily frustration with missing functionality.  I really wanted to like this phone!  I have found I need to swipe often twice to bring up the quick menu, sometimes I need to click twice to send an email or text.  The phone slows down more often than my old phone.  It is not obvious how to save attachments to the cloud.  Furthermore, the phone is just not a pleasure to use.  I switched to LG G3 and that has been an excellent phone, so much more responsive and it just works.  The Fire phone's problem is that it just isn't there.  It needs significant updating and firmware improvements, but hasn't been updated in over a month.  For those that adopt I truly hope that Amazon contiues to support the product, but I don't think they've been up to snuff so far, unfortunately.<br/><br/>OLD REVIEW:<br/><br/>First off a little bit about me.  I am coming over from a Lumia 920, which was overall a very solid phone.  I have a dislike for the iPhone and apple and I have owned an android phone before in the form of an HTC incredible.  I very much liked my windows phone, but I got tired of the small app ecosystem and the degraded music/video experience in the 8.1 update.  I am tech savvy, but I don't like to use my phone for too many things.  I use it for email, texting, phone calls, music, news, taking pictures, restaurants reviews, note taking and directions primarily.  I am not heavily invested in instagram, facebook or the like.  Why did I buy this phone?  A: I like to be a bit of a contrarian and have something different, heavily invested in amazon ecosystem, a year more of prime, intrigued by firefly and dynamic perspective and felt it was a good quality piece of equipment.<br/><br/>Alright, so onto the phone.  I very much like the size and build of the phone it has a nice feel in the hands.  While the screens ppi, might not measure up with some newer phones I find it crisp and viewable in all degrees of brightness.  Transitions between apps and scrolling is very smooth.  I do like the interface that gives you a window into the app on the carousel rather than having to open the app.  I think this is very nice and efficient.  I found the amazon email client and map client to be more than sufficient.  The camera itself is also quite nice and I like the cloud back-up.  The bluetooth pairing was also fast and seemless with my bluetooth headset, spearkers and car. Overall, I think the basic stuff works well.<br/><br/>What about dynamic perspective?  I think this is a very neat feature and does make some of the games more immersive.  I think the jury is still out on how useful it will be overall, but I think it is an intriguing technology that I hope will mature over time.  Right now I think it is a bit of a gimmick, but will hopefully become more.  I think the facial tracking can be utilized in interesting ways in the future.<br/><br/>Firefly, as others have said is a shazam, qr, object scanner on steroids.  It is impressive and will likely only become more and more able to detect a higher degree of objects.  It is worthwhile for comparison shopping.  I think it will be a powerful feature to build into other apps and is a selling point in my mind, but again, while almost there, still needs some polish.<br/><br/>The battery.  The first few days I didn't count as I was downloading and playing with it more than normal.  Also I think these batteries need a few full charges before they get to a steady state in my experience.  Now that I am a few days in I would say the battery life is fine.  I was able to go the whole day with my usual use pattern.  It also is more energy efficient than my Lumia 920 was when I am out of cellular service (which happens in certain areas in my workplace) and did not run down as quickly.  So overall, I think some of the complaints are by people who haven't given it a few days to settle out.  By no means is this battery a world beater, but I think it is not a negative in any particular way.<br/><br/>The app ecosystem.  Some will complain, but I have always like the amazon app store.  I use it on my Nexus tablet more often than the play store.  I am becoming jaded with google and don't particularly miss their apps, though I know that is a huge negative for some.  I was able to download all the apps I use save for 3: onedrive, xbox music, and foursquare.  The only one I really miss is onedrive and I hope that comes over soon.  I have really enjoyed amazon's music app and this has replaced xbox music largely for me as it can sync with my whole cloud collection and does it seemlessly.  So overall, I think the app store will continue to grow, it will lag google play and ios store, but I think it will not lag by too much and honestly it has the main apps you need.<br/><br/>Some of the things that bother me:  The built in music app is very cool with lyrics, but the tiles for the albums are way too big and it is harder to browse your albums due to the inefficient use of screen sapce, also its search function doesn't routinely search all my cloud songs and it doesn't sync with amazon's prime content.  I think this is disappointing and an oversight on their part.  I suspect this will be updated, but it is a bad start for this app.<br/><br/>Also I think the syncing with amazon cloud needs to be more robust.  There is no way to send email attachments, be they images or documents to the cloud that I can discern and tech support wasn't able to help me there.  This is something that needs to be fixed.<br/><br/>a couple other random comments:<br/>*Mayday is very slick and impressive.  I think it is an innovation in tech support<br/>*the swivel gestures and others work for me nearly 100% of the time and I actually like them.  They are very useful for one hand use of phone<br/>*it syncs exceptionally well with all of amazon's ecosystem, of which I am a heavy user, one of the reasons I went with this phone<br/><br/>Overall, I think this is a well made and well designed phone that can become a great phone with some conscientious work by amazon over the coming months.  I get the impression they are invested in this phone and am looking forward in them continuing to improve it over the coming months.
Being a self described Amazon fan boy I love this device. Great battery life, and fast. Still needs a little polish on the OS but I am confident Amazon is working on that.
Prior to purchasing this phone I had been an iPhone user for five years, I simply wanted a different experience and so far I am pleased. It has been easy to navigate and fun to use. I have found the Amazon app store has all the apps I used prior with the exception of the app for my bank and Redbox.  Amazon customer service is great and  easy to contact through the Mayday button, which is a very nice feature.<br/><br/>The browser is fast and I have found movies load quicker and run smoother on Netflix on this phone vs. the iPhone.<br/><br/>The call quality is great and I have service in places that were spotty when using the iPhone.<br/><br/>I have found that after reading txt messages it takes a few seconds occasionally to clear them as being read on the message icon. Also, there are no emoticons.<br/><br/>The tilt and swivel gestures are responsive and handy. Dynamic perspective is neat, however not many apps have taken advantage of this yet.<br/><br/>The battery life isn't quite as long as it was on the iPhone and it seems to take longer to charge.<br/><br/>So far I have enjoyed this phone and what it has to offer. However, for those heavily tied into the Google or Apple ecosystem this may not be the phone for you.
$99 is the cost of a year of Amazon Prime, Even if the phone was DOA, I got the year of Amazon Prime and a pair of earbuds, that have great sound quality, by the way.  I had nothing to lose in purchasing this phone for $99 when I switched from Sprint to AT&T.;  Sidenote:  After 15+ years as a Sprint customer, I left for AT&T; because Sprint's network availability and speed in my home town has deteriorated.<br/><br/>Back to the Fire phone.  I wanted more than 32GB of storage (the 32GB version was selling for $0.99 - yes, ninety-nine cents - with a 2-year contract).  I've had a month to get used to the Fire phone and would offer this feedback to Amazon about what I like and how to make it better:<br/><br/>* The dedicated camera button is nice feature.  push the button, located just below the volume buttons, and the camera is ready to go, even if the phone is locked.<br/>* The "peek" feature, enabled by the dynamic perspective capabilities, is handy, and I suspect, saves a little bit of battery use by not having all of the "peek" information lit up on the screen all the time.<br/>* The apps for Amazon, Audible, Kindle and Prime Instant Video are well done and make shopping, listening, reading and watching almost effortless.<br/>* I can see why it would be frustrating for other Fire phone owners (see their scathing comments elsewhere) if they could not get a specific app for the Fire phone.  But I have been able to find adequate substitutes on the Amazon Appstore, if not the exact same apps, that I had previously on my Android phone.<br/>* The motion-sensitive features (rotate counter-clockwise for settings, tilt left for app-specific options, tilt right for recommendations) are very useful.<br/>* The Kindle-crossover "carousel" feature is a nice touch.<br/>* You are not able to adjust settings (font, etc.) in the native messaging app, so I replaced it with a third-party app, Handcent.  Much better.<br/>* Please eliminate the ANNOYING pop-up that appears every 5 minutes or so when the screen is on that "reminds" me that location-based services are not turned on.  I don't WANT location-based services turned on, so make that &%(*#$^ reminder go away.  If I change my mind, I know where to activate that setting.<br/>*My old Android phone allowed me to put speed-dial buttons on the home screen.  Please add this functionality to the next version of the Fire OS.  I would like to have a page of speed-dial buttons on the home screen, instead of have to flag someone as a "VIP" in Contacts.
This is a great value for a very good phone.  $.99 gets you the phone, $10.00 in Amazon app coins, and a free year of Prime.  My experiences with the phone, which I have had for about a week now, have been very positive.  I am not a smartphone addict.  I basically use my phone for calls, music, podcasts, and the camera.  This phone excels at all of these.<br/><br/>UI - Dynamic Perspective was cute, but I didn't find that it served much of a purpose, so I disabled it about halfway through my first day with the phone.  Otherwise, the apps and tools I use were easy to find and easy to use.<br/><br/>Battery - GREAT!!  After disabling Dynamic Perspective, the phone sucks up just about 20% of the juice per 24 hours.  In the week I have had it, so far I have only charged it one time (not counting the initial charge).<br/><br/>Camera - Brilliant!  Specifically the Camera button on the side is a stroke of genius.  No longer do I have to unlock the phone to take a quick pic of the kids.  And with unlimited photo storage on Cloud Drive, I don't have to worry about the phone filling up.  There are settings to only allow photo syncing to Cloud Drive over WiFi so not to use up your data plan.<br/><br/>Screen - Good enough for me.  Crisp clear images.  If there are flaws, my eyes can't perceive any.<br/><br/>Music - Amazon Music Player built in.  Easy to download some playlists for repetitive offline playing (for kids), plus access to much more music.  Pandora available as well.<br/><br/>Podcasts - DoggCatcher readily available to use on Amazon App Store.  Used about $2 of the $10 credit on the app store to purchase.  Works great.<br/><br/>Apps - I know this has been a thorn in most reviewers side... not for me.  Every app I've needed has been available or has had a counterpart that does the same job.  The phone comes with Docs installed... allows you to view/edit Microsoft files (Word, Excel).  It may not have Google apps available... but most Android phones don't have Amazon Instant Video... this one does.  It even acts as a remote for my Fire TV.<br/><br/>Overall, I am pretty impressed and very happy with the Fire Phone.
This is an update to my previous review (See below). Everything still applies from before; however, this phone is getting worse the longer I have it (which has only been 1.5 months at this point - Oct 18). And, unfortunately, since I bought it through ATT and did not call them to exchange it for something else until 21 days after receiving the phone (a week outside of the 14 day return) I am stuck with this POS for the next 2 years. I feel like I have just been had by one of the few large companies in whom I still had faith. Shame on you Amazon for putting out this glitchy POS before it was ready for market, shame on you for not pulling back and notifying your customers as soon as the writing was on the wall that this phone was a dud, and shame on you for not proactively compensating your loyal customers who followed you down this endeavor by refunding or replacing this infuriatingly useless device.<br/><br/>Initial review follows:<br/><br/>This phone feels like an okay beta version of something that may be a wonderful device to come. Otherwise, I am going to defer to the review by Amity Lee "Amity" because this reviewer spoke to everything I have been feeling as if they had a wire tap in my mind.<br/><br/>"I wanted to love my Fire Phone. I really love Amazon and my kindle software, and they made it a bargain. Who could resist a year of prime on top of the rest? When at last it arrived, that sleek black box was a pleasure to unwrap.<br/><br/>The phone felt good in my hand, sturdy, well made. I used it as a phone -- wow, good sound, much better than many of the cell phones I've used in the past. Score.<br/><br/>I played with the dynamic perspective -- how nifty. I tried changing the backgound and here was my first disapointment -- a lot of them are dim, even bordering on creepy. Clearly time and effort was spent on choosing them, but they felt like Uncle Fester's last minute IT assignment. I finally chose one that bugged me the least. As my 9 year old said the first time he saw one, "Cool!" and then the next day, "that gets kind of annoying."<br/><br/>I moved forward, and loaded my email app, gmail, without a problem. I thought "Smartphones are pretty useful!" and felt reassured in my decision.<br/><br/>Then I started looking for other apps I've used on my android tablet, and I came up empty on the Amazon app store. Huh. I thought "no big deal, I can live without that app" and I searched for something else and thought "and that app too." Finally I realized a lot of google apps were off limits, and I had to rethink what I could do. It felt like a big step backward.<br/><br/>I found solace in streaming a song from my Amazon Music and opening up my current book using the kindle software. Better. Yes, reading was lovely. I took a picture and identified something instantly with Firefly -- nothing tricky, but it was fast. That was kind of fun. I never plan on using my phone to buy anything, however, so not that much fun.<br/><br/>I used the apps i was able to install, and I found myself befuddled a number of times. There's no software back button support. Some apps have a working back button within them, but not all, and there were times I felt trapped in whatever I was using, like Gretel after the breadcrumbs were eaten.<br/><br/>Swiping was supposed to help, as was flicking your wrist, but the responses were inconsistent. I thought I was fumbly and inept until I shared my phone with an IT pro and he also found that there were times where he'd flick his wrist 3 or 4 times without success. You'd feel so frustrated you'd want to start shaking it uncontrollably, then fling it into the wall. I loved catching him in those moments, our frustration shared. Navigation that was effortless on an android tablet became convoluted and difficult. MANY things that felt effortless on a full blown android were obscured or disabled.<br/><br/>A phrase swirled in my head, "you can't get there from here."<br/><br/>The low point came when I was showing off my new phone at work to extol the virtues of my new Amazon Fire. Flick fail. Swipe fail. Firefly fail. I could at least show the dynamic perspective with my lock screen, and they gazed politely. They tried the swipes and flicks, and sometimes they worked. Overall though, I think I solidified their loyalty to their current iPhone or Android. Sigh.<br/><br/>I had my Fire Phone two more demoralizing days, and gave up. What I thought at first was unhappiness due to unrealistic expections of having a smartphone, I came to realize was unhappiness based upon the comparison of my phone to my android tablet. It's just not as good. The Fire Phone is pretty and well made, but the software is crippled and the experience disappointing."
This phone is ALMOST there. I was a solid iPhone user since 2008 and was waiting until iPhone 6 to upgrade from my 4s. When the Fire phone price was lowered to $1, I figured ... well, I'm going to give it a try. I have 2 weeks to return it - so far I'm on day 10, and this phone is getter better.<br/><br/>I know there are some concerns - so I will address them.<br/><br/>BATTERY LIFE:<br/>Yes. For the first 3 days, the better life sucks. But, I think it just needed to be woke up. Let the battery completely die, then recharge it. Give it about 2 times this way. As of now, I can go all day, and ended up at 6pm with 23% battery still. And this is with consistent usage of email, texting, Bluetooth connection to my car (about 2-4 hours everyday since I travel a lot for work), streaming music, downloading new music from Amazon Prime, Candy Crush Saga, and obviously talking on the phone. So, my conclusion is - the battery gets better after a few warm up. Don't get too freak out :-)<br/><br/>APP STORE:<br/>Obviously, not as many apps available as the Apple or Android store. The only thing the held me back from keeping my Fire phone was the lack of a good check registry book, which I can't live without. They have several, but I found them not very good. HOWEVER, after days of searching, I finally found one call Cashflow, and it's better than the previous app I used on my iPhone. So, since that problem is now solved, I am now a happy camper. Many popular games are available, similar to what I had on my iPhone. There are MS Office apps, a lot of financial institution (but not AMEX ... that is disappointing), and handful of other things. If you are curious, search on Amazon website for Fire phone app - that's what I did to make sure that they had an app for my bank, otherwise I would have never bought it at all. It is probably good to note that - no, they don't work with Google play stuff; however, I don't use Google play, so I'm not impacted by it.<br/><br/>USER INTERFACE:<br/>Holy Easy! Took a bit to get use to as I am so familiar with the iOS, but I love the ability to function completely one-handed 99.99% of the time. I love the scrolling feature where the pages scroll as you tile your phone, the swipe up back motion, and the tilting left and right function built in in many apps. Many people say they find themselves "stuck" in many apps with no back button - that is because to go back, you swipe UP from a little below the screen. Took me a bit to get used to - and I think this should have been a part of the intro video. But now that I figure it out, this is pretty awesome.<br/><br/>I do have some recommendation - the left tilted screen that have pre-set menu (Apps, Games, Web, etc...) should be customizable. A preview of the text or facebook message when the screen is locked (like that an iPhone had) would be great, too. Music and Prime Music app should be combined somehow. It's annoying. Also, the feature that give me lyrics to song only work on songs in the music app, not prime music app - very disappointing. But these are just easy software upgrade, so I am hoping to see an upgrade that address these issues soon.<br/><br/>MAYDAY:<br/>Amazon get an A for customer service. The first day when I purchased this phone, I tried to connect to Mayday but I was not able to - the phone appear to have had a bad reception and could not connect to my Wi-fi. Once the connection to Mayday got disconnected, seconds later I received a phone call directly from the same Amazon rep that I was speaking to. She mentioned that during the seconds that we were connected through to Mayday program, she noted that I had the old OS and that it needed to be upgraded. This was at 10pm in the evening btw. All other Mayday calls I placed were answered within 5 seconds, and all my problems have been resolved with no issues.<br/><br/>FIREFLY:<br/>It works, but mostly with barcode rather than the product itself. I am being optimistic and hoping that they are upgrading their system to make this even better. I've used Amazon app on my iPhone to identify products and prices on regular basis anyway, this is pretty much the same. The ability to recognize phone number and email is pretty handy tho, especially when I'm in the car passing by an ads.<br/><br/>DYNAMIC PERSPECTIVE:<br/>It's pretty cool - but useless to me. My little sister love it, and there are some apps with built in dynamic perspective so that's pretty cool. The app icons are 3D as well, not just the lock screen.<br/><br/>WHAT I AM REALLY MISSING:<br/>Voice control is too basic - but I think I read somewhere that an upgrade is coming. I'd love to have Cortana on this phone ... she's much better than Siri. Plus, you can't use voice control while your phone is locked - so that take away the ability to quickly access something. Right now the voice control only allow you to make call, send messages, send emails, and search the web. A bit too basic for a smartphone released in 2014. I really hope Amazon address this very soon, along with my other recommendation above.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION:<br/>Give it a chance. For 99cent, I think this is a very solid phone and that it will get much better and can become a fierce competitor for the iPhone 6 and the Samsung Galexy S5. However, until several of the concerns that I pointed out is addressed, Amazon won't be able to increase the phone price above 99cent. But once it is addressed, I would happily pay $200 for this phone instead of $400 for an iPhone with similar specs.
Received the phone on 7/24 and drove to AT&T; to have old phone deactivated and Fire Phone activated. Went smoothly and no problems. They could not transfer files and contacts yet, but advised me to stop back in a few days. The next visit at AT&T; required an hour and multiple attempts by the Sales Asst/Tech guy but he got it done.<br/>The learning curve was steep and I bought three written articles/books to assist this retired HS teacher.<br/>The battery life has "sold me" if nothing else. I went from four to six hours on the old phone to over 40 hours with even more use on the Fire Cell. It is easy to read docs, news, emails, texts and watch videos. Of course, I wish the screen was larger and then I would not need my Kindle HDX nor my Nook. Unfortunately, this new Amazon Fire Phone will not run apps that run on my Kindle! For example the ($24.99 monthly) MLB.Com app (which runs on my Kindle but not my Nook) to watch baseball games; nor will the Amazon Fire Phone run our "Dish Anywhere" app designed for our home satellite TV that I watch on my Kindle and my Nook. Guess what, Amazon Fire Phone has the DirecTV app, which may be interpreted that Amazon's AFP engineers will get this corrected and have these two apps available, hopefully, in the near future. A few additional comments, the reception and clarity of phone calls are exceptional. The camera app takes great pictures, even at night of our beautiful California starry night skies. I do have one more thing. I have NOT found a safe, workable case to protect my Amazon Fire Phone investment. I received a (full-body hybrid case) from BrilloTech that I am returning today because it made my phone completely useless and the (case) even blacked out my screen during a phone call, I freaked out and could not get the blasted case off fast enough!. There was a complete lack of sensitivity to operate the four keys and the actual screen would not react for touch use or typing.
It is irresponsible to power your new product with fossil fueled energy.  By doing so you offer a low cost to buyers but pass the increased cost of air pollution on to the public where the American tax payers will foot the bill.  You also endanger the entire planet and life as we know it.  Get your act together; it's the 21st century and global climate change is a clear and present danger.  Do your part and become part of the solution instead of part of the problem
I love this phone. For Kindle owners, using this phone is a breeze! I am still learning about all the nifty little things this phone will do. I was a loyal Blackberry owner for 10+ years. I had a hard time making the switch to a more modern smart phone. I did a lot of research and decided this would be the one for me. I am glad that I did! I would definitely buy this phone again. I want to add that my first Fire phone had to be returned due to an issue with that specific phone. In no way was it an issue with the Fire phone in general. The issues I was having with my first phone are not issues with my second one. Amazon's May Day customer service was excellent and took care of replacing my phone hassle-free! They rock! You can't beat the Amazon May Day - unbeatable. I love all the apps available for this phone. It has been a lot fun getting to know this phone. As I said earlier, if you are a Kindle owner, this phone will be very easy for you to use, if you aren't, be patient. You will soon grow to love all the options. The camera works well and takes great pictures. The dynamic perspective is VERY cool. The ease of uploading and communicating with social media is second to none. I can see, for those who are not used to a Kindle's operating platform, being able to access your apps from several different areas (carousel, side swipe, apps list, etc) it might be a little confusing. Just relax and enjoy that Amazon has made it easy for you to access your "stuff" from anywhere you are in your phone. It's a keeper for sure!
I love my fire phone. I brought it on a cruise last week and the pictures and videos are awesome! The side button to activate camera came in handy, used it a lot. I had the same problem with the screen protector, I just customized it to not cover the camera lens and everything was fine ( small issue). I did my research before deciding to buy phone, so I knew that google play was not included. All of these complaints about google play is uncalled for. All the tech experts said if you are a google play fan this phone is not for you. It amazes me how people have short term memory concerning problems that arise with a new cell phone technology, one big time cell company had several major glitches.  I love that my kindle paperwhite and fire phone are in sync with each other I can resume reading where I left off. I will take the next few days to learn more about my fire phone, because I received my phone a day before my vacation. Mayday button is wonderful. Amazon is a great company and will solve any problems that arises with the fire phone.
How was someone able to spam hundreds of 1-star reviews for this phone?<br/><br/>Look at the 1-star reviews. With minor variations, the wording for all of them is the same. Something about the environment and "dirty" energy or this and that. It's hogwash. Total hogwash. Amazon is no "dirtier" environmentally than Apple or Samsung or any other corporation. "Fossil fuels"? What company doesn't use "fossil fuels" in its day-to-day operations?<br/><br/>Either somebody figured out a way to spam reviews and manipulate the rating for a product (which is a scary thought on a number of levels; not least of which is that it means we can't trust Amazon's review system), or else some activist organization urged hundreds and hundreds of people to post the same drivel to impact Amazon and drive down its rating to cause the company to lose money.<br/><br/>I think it's the latter. Look at the reviewers who posted these 1-star reviews. Most of them have only posted one review - against the Amazon Fire Phone. That tells me they were urged (paid?) to do so by person or persons unknown.<br/><br/>Now it's going to be nearly impossible to tell if the Amazon Fire Phone is worth buying or not.<br/><br/>I don't own it. And the reason why is NOT because of the phony 1-star reviews. It's because of the well-written, well-balanced 4- and 5-star reviews. the "cons" column revealed reasons that caused me to hold off on this product until the quirks, bugs, and limitations are worked out.<br/><br/>Why the 3-star review? Because I - like many of you who already own several Kindles - would LIKE TO own it. But according to reviews I trust, it's just not ready yet.<br/><br/>Whatever the Amazon Fire Phone's limitations or quirks, it doesn't deserve to be ratings-bombed by people who were either paid to post dishonest reviews, or who aren't really people at all, but sophisticated bots.<br/><br/>Either way, I'd urge people who might be considering this phone to NOT look at the average rating, but at the 4- and 5-star reviews, as I did. Decide based on those, not on the phony 1-star reviews.
I went to the At&t; store knowing exactly what i wanted. Luckily I did, because the AT&T; customer service didn't know anything about the Fire phone; its features, selling points, or its positive attributes as a good working phone. In fact, they didn't have any in stock because as I was told, no one buys them. Because I am an Amazon customer i was drawn to the phone because Amazon has always done me right. I'm glad I listened to my sixth sense. I took what i needed to know from all the reviews, and knew exactly why I wanted this phone. I have not been disappointed. I absolutely love this phone. Its easy to learn (I have been a flip phone user since the dawn of cell phones), So easy to maneuver. The camera is great, no lag between pushing the button and clicking of the camera. Crisp clear pictures as soon as it focuses. Uploading to email or facebook is a snap. I can hear my calls now, and they can hear me. Texting is easy also. I can find everything I need on my home screen.  This point is the coolest reason for this phone-all my books, music, games and information is already on the phone. Cause I have a Kindle, everything I have and own is at my finger tips. As far as the battery life, I have turned off some features which allows me to stretch my battery life twice as long. The fire phone allows you to turn off or modify most any setting. The Fire phone is truly set up how you want it. I feel safe and secure with all my information because I know Amazon isn't spreading it around. But I will say, the dynamic perspective is a battery hog and I had to choose between it and battery life. I chose battery life and everything dynamic perspective does, I just do manually. Like flip pages or going back to my last page. Now, my battery lasts a day and half before i plug it in again, depending on my use. You can't beat May Day, and Amazon Customer Service. They are always there, always friendly and always comforting. Now I'm an At&t; customer. Yahoo!!! Cause I finally can enjoy 4G in my small town. My call never drops and I have service everywhere.Their customer service is just as bright and smiley as Amazon's.  This phone is a win/win....love/love. And it was 99 cents. Thank you Amazon for having this vision.
This is my first smart phone and I truly love it!  I love everything Amazon and have been a customer for many years.  Because, this is my first smart phone the "mayday" feature helped me tremendously to learn how to use the phone.  I LOVE IT and have no complaints!!!
I want to point out that I do not have a Kindle Fire Phone but I am considering purchasing one. While reading customer reviews I noticed that virtually all of the one star reviews appear be written by the same individual.  Just take a look at them and see for yourself.  One star is given countless times because Amazon uses "dirty energy" while Apple and Google uses "clean energy."  The syntax and verbiage is virtually identical.  I urge anyone to take that into consideration when considering a Fire Phone purchase.
The 1,818 reviews all complaining that Amazon doesn't utilize clean energy for their cloud server doesn't tell me how the phone itself performs.  I could give a rat's a$$ what energy Amazon uses to power it's cloud.  For that matter all of my relatives work in coal mines so get off your high horses and give an honest review of this phone.  I bet none of the 1,818 who gave it 1 star even owns one.
Was checking reviews of the p;hone and saw a huge number of one star ratings.<br/>My first thought was that Amazon really produced a lousy phone.<br/>My second thought was to read the reviews and see what the problem was.<br/>After reading the low rated reviews I saw that the rating had been hijacked by some self absorbed 'environmentalists'. Obviously it was an organized effort with review after review that followed a scripted pattern.<br/>The negative posts had nothing to do with the phone itself. It was about the power sources used for 'cloud' functionality.<br/>I guess they prefer those hideous wind turbines that not only are a huge distraction while driving but also kill birds<br/>Before the hate mail floods in let me say I am environmentally responsible. I grow fruit and vegetables in my yard. I drive a fuel efficient car.<br/>I recycle everything. Get the picture?<br/>Bottom line - read the real reviews and vote down these garbage reviews.
Bought my 32GB Fire Phone in person from an authorized AT&T; dealer. I've used an iPhone 4S for the last two years and I must say I had no problems with it, it was reliable and there wasn't anything in particular that I didn't like about it. After using some of my friend's iPhones from generations 5 and 6 I just felt bored with them...let it be known that I'm not that big into using a ton of apps. I have a core group of five or six applications that I like to have on my phone and beyond that as long as calling, texting, and email functionality are good then I'm for the most part satisfied.<br/><br/>My old mobile device was nearly 6 months past due for an upgrade when the $0.99 price point for the $650 Fire Phone finally convinced me it was time. I had read through what seemed like hundreds of reviews of the Fire Phone from people who either hated it or loved it, really nothing in between so they weren't very helpful...but I decided that for $0.99 what did I really have to lose, I was just going to go for it!<br/><br/>I have had the Fire Phone for two weeks now and I am very pleased. Many of the complaints from other reviews I came across like difficult navigation, poor battery life, and lack of control over how to organize your apps seem to have been fixed with Amazon's first FireOS update which came very soon after hearing the feedback which tells me that the company is committed to continually improving the phone through updates (definitely a plus!)<br/><br/>The phone is a very comfortable size, it feels sturdy, and it is very quick and responsive so far. Call quality is good, texting feels natural and very comparable to many of the devices in the market today with the added option to use Swipe if you like. Some of the one-handed gesture navigation tools take some getting used to but they make using your phone with only one hand easy and appealing.<br/><br/>App selection through Amazon's Appstore is limited compared to Google and Apple undoubtedly but you have the option to turn on a setting which allows you to "Download Apps From Unknown Sources" which then gives you to access the rest of the Android market. I like all of the apps that came pre-loaded on the phone, and for stuff I couldn't find (like the app for my bank) I was able to use Silk web browser to go to the mobile website so really no loss in accessibility for me.<br/><br/>The Dynamic Perspective and Firefly features are really what set this phone apart, and while they are still new and somewhat raw I can definitely see exciting potential for future development and I fully expect Amazon to stand behind it's product and push those technologies towards new and innovative uses. The dynamic perspective can become annoying after a while if you are not playing any of the games that use it, but there is an option to turn it off if it starts to make you feel seasick.<br/><br/>Oh, and of course I have to mention that you get a full year of Amazon Prime for free so you essentially get paid $100 to buy this phone if you go with the $0.99 promotion, can't beat that.<br/><br/>All in all I think this is a very cool phone with tons of upside and I would definitely recommend trying it if you are someone willing to break away from the norm.
Before buying this fire phone I read the reviews, both negative and positive.  I was surprised at the number of negative reviews, some of whom seemed to want to say every possible negative thing about this phone with seemingly venemous hatred.<br/><br/>Having had a number of Amazon Kindle products before, I doubted that the negative reviews could possibly be true.  Nevertheless, I have an engineering background, so I tested it very carefully when I got it.  And I am happy to report that so far NOTHING in the negative reviews has come true for me.  I can only conclude those negative reviewers either had an anti-Amazon axe to grind, or didn't take the time to familiarize themselves with the phone through actual intelligent use of it.<br/><br/>ECO SYSTEM<br/>I've had three Kindle Fire tablets, and this Fire phone hooks seamlessly to their ecosystem of books and videos, which I use heavily in my professional work so that's important to me.  I've had the phone now for two weeks, and had no problems.  I think the quality of engineering is excellent, and that those who posted bad reviews never gave it a chance or didn't seek help for whatever problems they were having.<br/><br/>BATTERY LIFE.<br/>First of all, a lot of people complained about battery life.  The phone comes with everything turned on, which makes for a great demonstration, but you wouldn't leave every light in your house turned on all day long would you?  Every portable computer I've ever purchased had to be configured for optimum battery life, and the Fire Phone was no exception.<br/><br/>Once I got the phone, I ran through the demonstration, then turned off anything I wasn't using at the time, and I can honestly say the battery life has been excellent.  I haven't attempted to replicate Amazon's claims, but when I configured it to run just the phone, after 15 hours, the battery was only down to 96%, that is, it only lost 4% in a day on phone standby, which is MISERLY in my book and better than my previous phone.  Absolutely nothing to complain about here!<br/><br/>I've been on vacation, so I had more time than usual to fuss with the phone, and I've deliberately used it heavily to test the battery life.  On the heaviest days, by the end of a typical day's worth of downloading, being on the web, trip planning, maps, listening to music, and reading Kindle books, it was down to something around 49% by the time I was done for the day and ready to put the phone back on the charger before bed, which considering all the things I was doing during that day, again I have no problem with whatsoever.<br/><br/>The only time the phone ran down was when I left an app running when I thought I had turned it off.  We were driving at the time, and the phone warned me when it ran low, I put it on the car charger, and it charged up promptly.  Also, if you're going to be doing something very heavy like video streaming for hours and hours all day long, that would run down any portable device.  Just bring the charger with you and run it on the charger for that.<br/><br/>CONFIGURATION<br/>My one recommendation, turn off wifi if you're not using it, especially if you're driving, as it will keep trying to find wifi as you drive which means the wifi radio is running at full blast, which is a total waste of battery power.  Similarly, turn off the data plan if you're not using it so you don't have any surprises at the end of the month.  You can also turn off Location Services if you're not traveling, and turn off the 3D motion sensing if you don't need it for what you're doing.  Firefly only runs when you hold down the photo key, so that's not running if you haven't asked for it..<br/><br/>MAPS<br/>I've been driving around New England, and the maps application has performed flawlessly in trip planning, and then after I picked the route, keeping me on track on the maze of roads around the beach areas and other tourist attractions.  It's intuitive and never skipped a beat.  Even when I missed turns, it had the route recalculated in just a few seconds and was getting me back in the right direction. I have only good things to say about this app.<br/><br/>DATA PLAN<br/>The data plan has been considerably more miserly than I expected.  It's been two weeks and I've only used 168 MB.  The phone helps out in this regard, as it warns you if you're about to do a big download while the data plan is on, and it also has switches to completely suppress streaming and downloading unless you're on wifi, to keep you from using the data plan unexpectedly.<br/><br/>LAYOUT<br/>The phone is laid out intuitively.  I've never had to use the MayDay feature to ask for help, altho I hear that people who have done that were satisfied with the result.<br/><br/>USAGE INDICATORS<br/>It's very easy and only takes a few seconds to check battery life, data plan usage, and whether wifi or data plan are turned on.  There are lots of other things you can track as well.  No complaints here.<br/><br/>MESSAGING<br/>The messaging is intuitive and it works.  Nothing negative to say about it.<br/><br/>BROWSER<br/>The Silk browser is actually faster than on my Kindle.  Everything runs fine except YouTube, which hangs frequently, as it does on my other Kindles.  I solved that by using TubeMate 2.4 on my Kindles, and that is available on the Fire Phone app store and solves the problem there too.  It also allows you to download YouTube videos if you want.<br/><br/>WEATHER<br/>gives you instant weather for your area for today, and has a 10-day forecast on a side panel.  It doesn't have detail like the www.weather.com, so I find myself using the Fire weather app for a quick check, but the weather.com for doing trip planning to a distant area<br/><br/>SIGNING UP<br/>I bought my Fire Phone at my local AT&T; store.  The sales rep had me put in my Amazon account, and immediately all my hundreds of books and CDs were available on the phone for downloading.  That is what I have come to expect from Amazon, and no complaints about that.<br/><br/>DOWNLOADING<br/>Downloading a book takes seconds, CD tracks a bit longer, and large audio-books and full-length videos take awhile, showing times comparable to my Kindle tablets.  No hangs, no glitches, no complaints.<br/><br/>E READING<br/>Features similar to my Kindle tablets, that is to say, very satisfactory, with the ability to adjust fonts, line spacing, background shade, have the book read to me on audio (text to speech, very handy), highlight, make notes.  It's all synchronized, so if I read in a book on my Kindle, the next time I look at that book on the phone, the phone knows I've read ahead, and offers to advance the pages to that point.  No problem there!<br/><br/>VIDEOS<br/>I downloaded a full-length movie via wifi, and the quality of sound and picture quality are excellent.  You can of course stream instead of downloading.  Amazon Prime means there are thousands of free movies and TV shows available.  We've been using Prime free videos ever since it came out, and think it's a great feature.  I'm a Star Trek fan, and one of the first things I did was stream a Star Trek episode on the phone for free, and the quality was fine, no buffering glitches.<br/><br/>PHONE<br/>I've had AT&T; for years, so I'm very familiar with their service, which is basically troublefree.  The audio quality of the Fire phone is superior to my previous phone in voice clarity, so I'm happy there.<br/><br/>CAMERA<br/>Haven't used the camera extensively as I have a video camera I take with me, but the sample photos and videos I took with the phone were fine.<br/><br/>FIREFLY<br/>I LOVE this feature.  I collect old books, and even books that have been out of print for many years are quickly identified by pointing the phone at them, so if someone shows me an old book which is recommended, a few seconds later, all the used book dealers in the Amazon network show up so I can order a copy if I wish just by pushing a button.<br/><br/>AUDIO BOOKS<br/>I use audio books extensively, and all the audio books in my Amazon cloud account were immediately available to download, and the ones I have downloaded have worked flawlessly, no complaints<br/><br/>AUDIO QUALITY<br/>I have hooked the phone to my theater system, and played complex sources like pipe organ and they reproduced excellently<br/><br/>EAR BUDS<br/>These are the BEST earbuds I have ever used.  I compared them to a high quality Bose over the ear headphone for complex sources like the pipe organ, and of course the Bose was better, but it also cost several hundred dollars more.  What amazed me was how good the Amazon phone earbuds were, they were far better than any of my other earbuds, and the fact that they were almost as good as the Bose unit blew my mind.(they are large for earbuds and have an extra conductor in the plug for a subwoofer element in each bud).  I think this is a selling point for this phone which has been overlooked)<br/><br/>APP STORE<br/>I downloaded several of the apps I use on my Kindle Fire tablets for newspaper and TV news show playback, and they all worked fine as expected.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/>This unit performed flawlessly for the two weeks I've had it, it's never skipped a beat, never hung or crashed.  Everything has been high quality and worked as expected.  I'm very happy.  My suggestion, ignore the negative reviews and give the phone a try.
I actually own this phone, I also have a Galaxy S5. The picture quality on the Fire is by far better than the Galaxy. It has every app that I use on my Galaxy. The difference is that the apps on the Fire don't burn up battery throughout the day even when you're not playing them.<br/><br/>Amazon's gotten a bad wrap on this phone mainly because they've allowed people who don't own this phone to give reviews. The Fire is so much more creatively advanced then any other phone out there, even the iPhone 6 (bracing for verbal assault from the Apple loyalists).<br/><br/>If you aren't married to one manufacturer then I would highly recommend this phone. You won't be disappointed. Keep fighting the fight Amazon, just like with the Kindle.<br/><br/>***Update****<br/>I've now owned this hone for almost 3 months now and it continues to be a great phone. I use it all day and the battery never gets below 50%. The apps may not be everything google has but they have a lot and most are really good. I haven't had any issues with it at all. Again, if you're not partial to a specific manufacturer or to google play or iTunes then you won't be disappointed with this phone. Overall it's a great phone 3 months in. It's just disappointing that the reviews were hacked by green peace over an article from an under-informed journalist about energy choices of Amazon for there cloud storage.
The Amazon Fire phone is impressive given that it is Amazon's first iteration in the smartphone market.  The voice recognition beats the Galaxy S3 that I had easily.  The navigation is excellent in that it tells me to keep to the right or keep to the left much earlier than the S3 did.  The Firefly feature is pretty amazing as well with it's recognition of bar codes, QR codes, phone numbers, etc.  It has most of the apps I would want available in the appstore. The Prime benefit is truly icing on the cake.  I also love the synchronization with my Kindle Fire and with Audible.  The biggest drawback for me coming from having had an Android phone is the lack of a dedicated back button.  To go back, you swipe up which can take some getting used to.  The biggest problem with that is when you zoom in a Facebook photo, because you may have to swipe up two or three times to get it to go back.  Using fingernails seems to work best.  Other than that in future versions, I would like to see a bigger display and a removable battery.  Overall though, it's a great smartphone.
I actually liked this phone, and felt that the depth perception could, over time, be used to create a unique experience. I also liked the overall feel of the phone. I had some trouble with stability of certain apps, but I expect these to get fixed over time. After I posted my dissatisfaction with Whatsapp, I actually got a response form Amazon saying that the problem was fixed - and it was ! What bothered me was how hot the phone got at times - twice in the very first week it got so hot that I could not even keep it in my pocket - had to power it off and lay it down. I ended up returning the phone. I hope Amazon fixes this.
I was looking forward to this phone.  [removed] The phone looks cool and has some "cool" features, but not that useful.  For instance the 3D screen tricks are neat, for about 30 seconds.<br/><br/>The big drawbacks are not being able to get apps from google play.  Apps that worked great on my old Razr are either not available, or broken in the amazon app store.  Also there have been several glitches with the phone.  Sometimes the keyboard does not work.  A couple times I could not answer the phone because the device response was so slow.<br/><br/>The UI is pretty, for sure.  And the one handed scrolling is nice, but I'm a little surprised that the built in kindle reader does not respond to it!<br/><br/>I thought this would be great because I love my kindle fire.  I assumed amazon would knock this out of the park, but they didn't.<br/><br/>[edit - I had been upset about the price drop after me paying full price.  But support helped me get a refund for the difference.  I bumped this review by one star. Gotta say thanks to the very efficient support team! ]
This phone is a Kindle Fire that does calls and text.  If you love your Kindle you will love this phone.  If you know how to use your Kindle Fire this phone will be intuitively simple for you to understand and operate. If you already own a smartphone or you're not yet part of the Amazon universe then you may find this phone too Amazonian.  Many of the honest negative reviews criticize that the phone is too narrowly focused on the Amazon market, excluding cross-platform content available on other smartphones. This is not a bad thing if you are invested in Amazon apps and media because everything from the cloud is available for download into your phone.  If you've been buying from the Google Play Store or ITunes for years you may be upset at first.<br/><br/> Amazon has made a huge advertising push for the Firefly, Mayday, and Dynamic Perspective features.  These things are neat, but not selling points.  So I feel that the hype makes these really cool features seem underwhelming.  Comparison by specs puts this phone above other phones of its class.
Great phone!  Cool graphics.  Mayday rocks.
I just love my Fire phone! I previously had the iphone 4.  The battery lasts and lasts and lasts! The only downside I have experienced is not being able to get google apps.  I liked this phone so much that I bought one for my son! Compared to the iPhone 4 I really love the Fire so much more and I didn't think I would as I was an iPhone loyal person!
My opinion of the Firephone has improved a great deal, from when I first received it.  It's very well engineered and the screen resolution is excellent.  The Firefly feature is very useful and innovative.  I enjoy the Dynamic Perspective feature too, though I'm not really keen on how its going to be useful.  The app library is pretty good, better than I first experienced.  Once I was able to view the number of available apps on the Fire OS, I discovered the selection was more than adequate for my needs.  The only drawback is AT&T.;  Their service is dismal, particularly when you realize how much you pay for it.  Amazon's customer support is excellent and helped me, when AT&T; could not or would not.
I probably did not bought it at the right time. But once you get Google up and running, we've got to do this phone justice. This is an amazing phone for the price. After installing Google Play as a alternative app store, I have like ZERO complain regarding this phone. At a proper price point, the hardware is outstanding especially the camera. Great quality, dropped it a few times during jogging, still works fine.<br/>BTW, in case you don't know how to install google service and change this into a regular android phone. Here's how. No root necessary.<br/>http://winterinseattle.blogspot.com/2015/02/change-amazon-fire-phone-into-almost.html
Awesome phone! however it gets hot very fast. Battery life not reliable. Many of the apps that I had on my old phone can not put them on the fire phone. Have not been able to transfer my contacts. Using Facebook, when you open a picture there's no way back out.<br/><br/>Update:<br/>Still trying to love my phone. I can't return it, I got stuck with AT&T.; I have a Kindle and they connect pretty good. The camera is awesome. What I'm getting very disappointed is on the lack of App  ability. There are many apps that I used on my old Android and I can't get them on my Fire phone. Also, I'm getting a little bit irritated with AT&T; coverage. I constantly loose connection even at home.
I absolutely love this phone. I read several reviews, before I bought it, not all good, but decided I was going to buy it anyway and give it a try.<br/>I read reviews, saying you get in apps and cannot get out. When this happened to me I remembered seeing in the tutorial (which I did not watch all of, because I'm just like that) that if you swipe up from below the screen, the picture or whatever you are looking at will close.<br/>Lesson learned! Watch the tutorial, when you get the phone!
After receiving the phone, I couldn't wait to open it. I was looking for something new to try and boy did I ever get that.<br/><br/> First off, the box that it came in was simple in design and yet beautiful. An outer textured pattern sleeve with the fire logo on front, and an image of the phone and simple description of what was inside on back. The real box slid out from either the top or bottom of the sleeve. A basic black exterior with a vivid reddish orange inside. the first thing you'll see is the phone. And it's beautiful. Smooth glass on front and back, and not being use to all this smoothness had me grabbing this phone with extra caution at first. I plugged it in, gave it a full charge and was ready to go.<br/><br/> It also came with ear buds which have a nice tangle free cord, and interestingly shaped ear pieces. The nice part about the ear buds is that you will never lose the rubber ear plugs because these ear buds don't have any. It's a "one size fits all" deal here. They have a smooth black plastic shape which make them easy to clean, when not in use they click together by magnetic ends which help in keeping them from getting all tangled up. They do fit my ear, and they sound great, but because of the smoothness of the plastic, they would tend to slip out of my ears at times.<br/><br/>Turning on the phone you'll see the Fire logo, and a helpful intro to get you started with your new phone. So before you do turn on your phone make sure you set some time aside. There will be an update to download which was painless. And activating the phone was also painless.<br/><br/>Graphics wise, I like the Carousel option, and it is customizable thru the act of pinning certain Apps to it.<br/>This is not the Android phone your use too. I'll admit I was confused by some of the gestures I needed to learn in order to navigate this new phones interface, and in some areas it aggravated me briefly, but once I got use to things I wondered why nobody ever thought of this style of navigation before, it's so natural, so easy.<br/>I also learned that none of my Google App purchases carried over to this Android phone. And Amazon does not have the selection of apps that Google or Apple have... yet. But AT&T; gave me a free LG Tablet with the purchase of my phone, so my Google Apps were not that far away. Apps like Bank Of America, or the Firefox Browser are not available on Amazon, and I do have a list of other common apps that I use and are also not available on Amazon... YET! They are working it, I found this out by talking to the people of Amazon using the "Mayday" feature.<br/><br/>Mayday intimidated me at first, because I'm not use to taking with somebody like this on my phone, seeing their face, live, in front of me was definitely going to be something new to me. But I did have some concerns about my phone as well as what I thought were legit questions, so I decided to give it a try. And let me tell you, this has to be the most AWESOME feature ever put on a phone. The people of Amazon are some of the coolest people you will ever talk to. You can Mayday them with just about anything. And they are so patient with you, and fun to talk too. No question is too big, to small, to dumb, they treat you like family. A great feature to Mayday is that they can control your phone (with your permission) showing you exactly where to go on your phone to fix or do whatever it is you are trying to accomplish. They can even draw on your screen little arrows, they can circle things, one of the Mayday people even drew a cat on my screen just to show off.. it made customer support such a pleasant and fun experience. Also note, you can see them, but they can not see you. So don't worry about pressing Mayday with that pimple on your face... your good.<br/><br/>The Dynamic Perspective is cool to show off some 3D effects, and Amazon has some cool games that utilize this feature, but those extra cameras on that phone do so much more, they help with the gestures you'll need to learn to navigate the phone, they accurately track your head position to add features in making things easier to browsing pages on websites and when reading Kindle Books and digital magazines, there is a cool Peeking feature which is used on the phone itself and on the Amazon Website, and more.<br/><br/>13 Megapixel Camera gives me some amazing pictures. The phone has a dedicated button for the Camera and its very responsive. Taking pictures is fast and easy. I use the Camera a lot a work. It's nice to grab, press and click... picture taken. And these pictures are very clear.<br/><br/>And then there is Firefly... I love Firefly. It hears Music, tells me all about the song and artist. Reads Barcodes of all types, tells me what TV shows are playing by pointing my camera at the TV screen, and reads text from documents or postings very accurately and converts it to editable text to add to a document App of my choice, or email or text message.<br/><br/>This phone takes time to get use too. I myself am really enjoying this phone. I listen to my Prime music, 64GB gives me plenty of room for all my music, my photos, I can watch my Prime movies and Tv shows, I have access to my Prime account and shopping. Keep track of all my shipping,  It's Amazon's first attempt at a phone and I really believe they are on to something big here.<br/>Fits nice in my hand, has a premium weight, feel, and look to it. Has a great battery life which I'm actually quite shocked about considering it only has a 2400mAh battery. My previous phone had a much larger mAh amount and this Fire phone lasts just as long, and yet has 4 Cameras, plus infrared, plus a Selfie Camera, plus a 13 Megapixel rear camera with flash and Dual stereo speakers?... Not sure how they pulled this one out of their hat. But I am impressed.<br/><br/>Bad part about the battery is that it's not removable. However, Amazon Basics sells a 10,000 mAh portable battery charger for $30.00 which you can bring with you to give you that extra sense of security in regards to battery life issues. But I haven't needed to use mine so far. But I'm sure as this phone gets older, so will the battery, and we all know what happens to batteries then.... only time will tell.<br/><br/>I'm only giving this phone 4 Stars mainly because of the poor App selection. And the phone needs some work, for example; The default text App is hard to read (light blue text on white background) and you can not adjust the size of the text, but they have other Texting Apps to choose from (I like Textra) so I'm getting by. And they also have a feedback area in the Settings section of the phone where you can submit your complaints, experiences, ideas, and in my case "App Choices" that I would like to see on this phone.<br/>Otherwise I see no reason not to give this phone a full 5 Stars.<br/><br/>Looking forward to the future and can't wait to see what the next Fire Phone will look like. And by then I'll assume they will have a better selection of Apps as well made some more improvements to this current Amazon Phone.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I'm very pleased and proud to own this phone.
I have now had my Fire Phone up and running for the past three months, so I decided now was a good time to get a review in.<br/><br/>I got my phone through the AT&T; store in my town. I already had AT&T; before I switched phones and they were doing their nice trade in on iPhones so I decided it was time for an upgrade. I was very into the Amazon ecosystem before I switched phones. My go to music app on my iPhone was the Amazon Prime Music app. I used the Amazon Instant Video app often. It seemed like a no-brainer to go to the Amazon Fire Phone.<br/><br/>So let's get into what I thought of the phone when I first got it. I was switching from an iPhone 4, so the Fire Phone was a bit bigger and actually a little bit lighter. Buttons were in all different places, so that took some getting used to. But overall it had a very nice feel in my hand. Not too big, not too small. Not too light, not too heavy. Before I had gotten the phone, I'd done my research into it and I'd seen everybody's complaints about the back button swipe thing, so that wasn't a surprise to me and I had it working correctly the moment I turned it on. I don't remember all of my first impressions, but I do remember being very impressed with the audio and the camera. They may not be the best out there, but compared to an iPhone 4, they're amazing.<br/><br/>Getting into things only this phone can give you: I know that a lot of people say that Dynamic Perspective is a gimmick, but there are actually some very useful things with it. I like the little bit with the status bar at the top of the screen. You can have it set that the status bar isn't there unless you tilt your phone a bit. I wasn't sure what to think of that when I first got the phone, but after trying it out both ways, I went with using the tilt-to-see method. It just makes the phone look better. I can't describe it well, but that little bar is just not very glamorous when it's stuck to the top of your screen. Other things like peek to see more details can keep the screen from getting cluttered.<br/><br/>I use Firefly mostly to identify movies and tv shows since it connects with IMdB. It's very good at identifying what you're watching and it will also pull open a list of actors who are in the scene you're watching if you're trying to remember where you've seen that actor, like I usually am. I've had things get identified solely by their music because I happen to have it listening when no one is talking and Firefly still gets it right. I don't use it to buy things. I may be into the Amazon ecosystem, but I don't need to use Amazon that much.<br/><br/>Speaking of Firefly, there's a dedicated camera button on the side of the phone which when long-pressed goes to Firefly. This button is directly beneath the volume control buttons. For the first few weeks I had my phone, I would always mistakenly press the camera button instead of the volume down. But I rarely do that nowadays unless I'm fighting against the pockets on my jeans and just happen to press the camera button in the process.<br/><br/>I knew that the Amazon Appstore didn't have any of the Google apps. I didn't really care. I didn't use them anyway. However, there were a few apps that I did use that I couldn't find in the app store. Things like Snapchat. However, you can sideload apps on this phone and some apps may give you a pop up error every now and again for not having some Google service, but they work just fine other than that.<br/><br/>The 1000 Amazon coins that came with this phone were a great deal. I think the idea behind them was that you could buy back the apps that you had on your old phone or something, but I used them to buy things that I never wanted to pay for on my old phone. Not only that, but the year of free Prime was a great deal as well. With how much I used Prime before I got this phone, and how much that has increased, it's definitely been worth my while.<br/><br/>From the time that I bought the phone, there have been some software updates. The latest one included things that I felt were missing from the phone when I first got it. Things like the ability to block calls and having the screen wake when you get a notification. I've had the latest software update for about and week now and my phone has been working great. There were some bugs that I had before involving the lock screen when I would unlock the phone, but I haven't had that problem so I believe it was fixed with the latest round of updates.<br/><br/>I'm not super techy, so I don't really care about pixel density and processors and all that jazz. All I care about is that it's nice to look at and that it doesn't lag. Everything works like it should. But one thing I have noticed is that for whatever reason, this phone can have a super bright screen. Like insanely bright. The only time I have my phone at full brightness is when it's in direct sunlight, and I can still see the screen just fine. My phone is usually on the very dim side of things and it's still fairly bright, but it can dim quite low for low-light situations when you don't want a flashlight for a screen.<br/><br/>The only bad thing that I can really say about this phone is that it occasionally has a bug that makes some of the icons black until they reload a few seconds later. But that's not exactly a deal breaker for me.<br/><br/>I've really come to love this phone. I'm sure that's it's not right for some people. Definitely not right for people that are very into Google and their system. But for someone like me or someone just looking for a change, I feel this phone is a great choice.
I'll start of by saying I'm really new to the Amazon universe. I've been an iPhone user since the iPhone 3g days, so it was with much hesitation that I decided to give the Fire Phone a try.<br/>I got off to a really rocky start with the device. The day after I got it, I had to go back to the AT&T; store because the phone froze and I could not reboot it. Over the next week or so, I started to really regret switching from the iPhone to this thing. I started missing the simple user interface of the iPhone, my emojis, my apps-- like Runkeeper, Bank of America, Drop box, Google maps.... etc. Then the phone quit notifying me of missed calls constantly... I called AT&T; and they pawned me off on Amazon. Customer service is amazing with Amazon and they did not disappoint, they sent me a new unit which had a glitch with the proximity sensor or screen protector, not sure which. Fire Phone #3 arrived and it too had a bunch of glitches, including the fact that I could not access any pictures that I took with it...the picture folder was literally misssing.. well, after fighting with AT&T; and basically being told by Amazon Mayday that there was something definitely wrong with the unit. I bit the bullet and did a factory full reset. Haven't had a major problem since. I'm pretty much used to the ui and I learned to download some apk's of the apps I absolutely need..oooh,  also added the handcent mms app for texting, it has emojis, skins, popup notifications like my old iPhone but better. I'm a happy camper with this phone now. Still a little glitchy, but hoping an update us released soon addressing its small issues.<br/>Weird, I hate not being like the majority of people  who have an iPhone or a Samsung, but I love being one of the few sucke....er ah ... I mean consumers to be a test dummy for this new device in the market.<br/>Good luck Amazon, I'm hoping you perfect the Fire Phone and I can say I was a visionary and a pioneer .. haha.
I bought the Fire Phone because it was time to upgrade my wife's Nokia and the price was irresistible.  Overall, I like the phone very much except for one or two things.<br/><br/>1.  The email is, to me, missing a very important feature:  That is, it removes the email from the server when it collects the email, therefore keeping other devices from collecting the email.  My Iphone has a setting to allow it to stay on the server (which is what I need the Fire to do.  Because of this I am not (cannot) use the Fire email.  Amazon has indicated they will submit this problem to their developers.<br/>2. Many apps do not seem fully functional.  By this, I mean, the path through the app is not well laid out.  Specifically, some of the apps do not have back buttons when needed and you can only get to a prior page by using the home button.  Some of the apps get in a state where you cannot proceed except by deleting them and starting over.  There needs to be more back buttons.<br/><br/>Also, the Kindle app for reading newspaper does not have an Article List so you cannot scan the newspaper without going through every article.  This is implemented in the Fire Kindle and works well, it also works on the Iphone Kindle app but Amazon has recently changed the location of the list so it is not very convenient to use.<br/><br/>I also miss the Bank of America App which works on the Kindle Fire but not on the phone.  This I do not understand.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I like the phone very much.  The sound quality is excellent, the screen is wonderful, the device size seems perfect, the sound qualify through the headphones is excellent.  I am very happy with the device, I use it almost daily, but, as of yet, it does not replace my Iphone.<br/><br/>RW<br/><br/>10/4/14<br/><br/>I've had my FirePhone for about 2 weeks.<br/>The voice (phone) quality is excellent.  In San Francisco it (sometimes) signs on to the ATT LTE network.  With or without the LTE, the download and upload cellular speed is excellent, in the range of 25meg, much better than my Wi-Fi access.  Nonetheless, I don't routinely use cellular data as it is not necessary (and will cost more money, of course).<br/><br/>The phone is nice to use, the screen is easy to read.<br/><br/>The (music) sound quality is excellent, much better than the white  buds with my Iphone.  I think it is probably more than just the buds, but I can't be sure.<br/><br/>I have used the Amazon music service which includes many of my own recordings plus the prime Amazon music.  These programs work seamlessly well.<br/>Rhapsody mostly works well.  I have very long play lists which are slow loading, sometimes the sounds breaks a bit.  I do have Rhapsody set on its highest quality level, however.  Rhapsody app needs improving as it has to reload the playlists each time you access them.<br/><br/>Pandora works very well as does TuneIN Radio.  Both work perfectly.<br/><br/>Unbelievably, there is no Bank of America App even though there is one for the Kindle Fire.<br/><br/>Playing solitare is fun, but there are the horrible, horrible commercials with every deal.  I have the same program, same company for my Iphone and it does not have commercials.  (I think I paid to have them removed some time in the past, there is no such option for the FirePhone app.<br/><br/>This is a very nice phone, I very much recommend it to anyone except for:<br/><br/>The email app is still deficient.  It does not have the ability to adjust how the message is handled on the mail server.  It always erases the message from the server.  This is not what I need and I will be glad when they add this ability (as Iphone has).  I recognize this probably makes no difference to many users.<br/><br/>One more thing, the device is extremely responsive to touch controls and so forth.  This is a real relief as my original Kindle Fire device is balky, slow and so forth.<br/><br/>RJW
I love the phone. Comfortable headset with volume control too. The screen resolution is good at about 315dpi and better battery life than my old HTC One and great sounding stereo speakers.  I'm enjoying using it.  I really like the "swipe up" navigation to go "back".  The swipe "in" from the left and right also offer easy access to common functions.  Really well thought out.  The built in "flash light" option available when I swipe down is thoughtful.<br/><br/>The unique Kindle feature that this phone can read out loud my daily newspaper subscription to me is awesome and super handy when I'm in the car or eating breakfast.  Since this Kindle Phone is a real "kindle" it can read almost any book out loud as well even if professional narration is not available.  This is a killer feature and works really really well.<br/><br/>The Amazon wallet app stores all of my loyalty cards such as my Starbucks card to pay when I get coffee and even my local library card and automatically generates barcodes and QR codes as needed. It's great!  I also noticed that battery life is much better than on my old phone.  One of the most pleasant surprises are the stereo speakers! They sound great on top and bottom.<br/><br/>BTW, the voice recognition on the Kindle Fire Phone is amazing.  It works well and even recognized my wife's unusual name and spelled it correctly.  Again, Amazing!  I've never had a phone I like more (and I've had a few phone!).  "Mayday" service from the phone works great to to obtain immediate live customer assistance with any question even when away from home out of a WiFi area.
I've waited a couple of weeks before writing my review.  My husband and I have had work cell phones for years and never wanted to change out my land line for a cell phone and carry two phones until now.  We are big iPhone fans, but the Amazon Fire Phone is the perfect phone for us to end the land line with since we are big Amazon users.  It has taken me awhile to get used to the phone and I'm still looking for the perfect case for it.  I love how fast I can access my email and apps.  Haven't even begun to use or play with all the features.  Since I have my iPhone for work I can access apps that are not available on the Fire phone, if the Fire phone was my only phone I probably would be taking it back for these reasons:<br/><br/>1.  Really need Google Play, cannot download my bank's mobile app which I use a lot on my iPhone, plus other apps I would like to get<br/>2.  Battery life is an issue, I have all notifications turned off, if I do not play games, the phone lasts all day, if I play a game, the battery drains really fast.<br/>3.  I do think the phone heats up too much when playing games,  I should not have to turn off the Dynamic Perspective to keep the battery life alive, and keep the phone from heating up.  This is the feature I really like.<br/><br/>9/8/2014<br/>Not a cool move, Amazon, offering the phone for $.99 with a two year contract without contacting existing customers that paid $99.00 for it and offering us something.  Makes me question my decision.  I still love the phone.  Contacted customer service to submit my complaint about this.
After my title, I must explain that the app store is nothing like the iPhone or Galaxy app stores, however, (for me) it is more than sufficient and they have already begun adding additional apps. I was pleasantly surprised to find an app that just recently came to the iPhone but was already on the Amazon app store. I received my phone two days after the initial launch date and it originally did not have the LinkedIn app and now does. It will be a growth process but I am willing to wait, because I know it will be worth it. For someone who is REALLY into apps and games and that is their key usage, you may want to wait.<br/><br/>All of that being said, I LOVE this phone. Unlike initial reviews, prior to the launch, I find it easy to use and not "gimmicky" as a lot had reported. In fact, I think it's nothing of the sort. It is clean, easy to learn and quick to respond. The ability to swipe up from the bottom to return to whatever the previous thing you were doing, is really nice.<br/><br/>It doesn't show a preview of your tests unless you swipe down from the top but it does at least notify you at the top and again by showing a symbol on the screen, when you have an email or text. Having come from an iphone, this was a bit of a change but I've gotten very used to it.<br/><br/>Firefly is superb for someone who really likes to be able to see reviews of products and pricing at a glance. I've found it to be helpful rather than "a pushy shopping phone" as some have suggested.<br/><br/>Mayday has also proved to be helpful. I love being able to quickly and easily access a customer service agent when needed, without a long wait time on the phone.<br/><br/>The right menu on the phone is helpful. It is nice to be able to easily access the weather and calendar notifications as well as texts. The ease and multple options to add photos into texts is also smooth and well thought out.<br/><br/>The battery life is better than some are stating. I have had no issues with the batter life on this phone. In fact, I have to charge it less than I charged my iPhone.<br/><br/>Give this phone a chance. Take a risk and have real expectations going in and you'll enjoy the product. I do believe they put a lot of thought and effort into building the device and it's worth the switch to try the Fire.
What an awesome phone, especially for the price! The graphics are second to none, it is fast and responsive, and sleek and sharp.  Compared to even the iPhone 6, this phone blows away the competition.  I cannot understand why someone would pay for an iPhone when they are so sub par to this phone.<br/><br/>We already owned the Kindle HD and the Fire TV, so getting Fire phones was the natural progression for us, and we also received another year of Prime for free.  you just cannot beat that value!
UPDATED 10/27/14<br/>I wanted to point out that we have had a software update recently and it, in my opinion, has helped the battery life.<br/>Also, I neglected to relate that from the moment I started using this phone it seemed to me that it had a learning curve of it's own. It seems to be kind of intuitive. I suppose it is really the burn in period for the software/hardware but it is pretty cool.<br/><br/>I want to thank all those who don't own the phone and are spamming the Fire Phone reviews with their foolishness. You actually pushed me closer to Amazon. I really don't care that at this moment Amazon uses fossil fuels to run the cloud. I think it will be cool when Amazon does go solar or wind cuz they probably will, eventually. Thanks again, your smear campaign back fired, at least in my case.<br/><br/>I own the phone. So, I wanted to make sure I gave this phone a good workout before I made my review. I want to cover as much about the phone as possible, as these reviews were monumental in my decision to switch from IPhone 4S to the new Fire Phone.  I am so glad I did.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>I am a fan of Amazon and all they do to give value and great customer service. They don't disappoint with this phone. this phone is very high tech. Mayday is phenomenal. I have used it a few times and those reps are very knowledgeable, friendly and always available. Great feature. Dynamic Perspective is just plain cool. The phone itself is well built and feels great in my hand.  I wanted to go to a bigger phone but not too big. This is perfect size. The screen and display are awesome. A year of Prime(enough said). $10.00 credit in the App store. $.99 for the phone are you kidding? Hard to beat! Customer service is always improving.  Firefly is another "just plain cool" feature. Camera takes great pix. Unlimited photo storage is very cool and well thought out. The sound is top notch and dual speakers make it premium.  The headphones are awesome. The company is constantly wanting feedback and implementing updates and improvements based on that feedback. I like that they listen to the customer.<br/><br/>Neutral:<br/>There is a learning curve with this phone. There are a lot of features and nuances. I had to be patient with learning the phone. I really don't mind. This is not an IPhone and it isn't supposed to be. This is my first Android based phone. Locked into to At&t.; I was with them anyway and they have pretty good service and coverage.  The battery life is better than my 4S was at the end but wish it was better, but not a deal breaker.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Apps. I see a lot of Apps in the Amazon store but not many I would buy or download. There have been a lot of users who mention Google Play access and I hope that happens. Or more development for the Amazon Apps. I miss my banking app and church app. Ringtones and notification sounds are weak, making my own with ringtone maker app. I got dependent on the event notifications(that little number that tells you how many notifications are waiting for you to look at) with my IPhone. The apps in the App Store don't seem to have that feature for some reason. I'd like to see that be available(listen up App Techs and developers).  The base texting app doesn't have emojis!!! Really??!! That needs to change.  I was able to move most of my ITunes library over to the Cloud. Most. Amazon doesn't have permissions for all my music. This isn't a phone issue but an issue. Also, I wish the cost to store my music in the cloud was less expensive($24.99 a year for 250,000 songs).<br/><br/>Miscellaneous:<br/>Side Loading is risky. Well maybe not side loading itself but the sites  you get the apps from are. I made the mistake of side loading some apps and it wreaked havoc on the phone. I had to do a Factory Reset on the phone to correct it. The reps at Mayday were awesome in helping me figure it out and correct it. Also, found out that Anti Glare screen protectors don't work well with the sensors. Use Clear screen protectors. There were a lot of reviews complaining about the phone getting hot. I have only experienced that when I have been using the phone outside in the direct sunlight.<br/><br/>I am very glad I switched to the Fire Phone. I highly recommend it. Take advantage of the price and the service. I am confident that Amazon will continue to improve it and they are dedicated to making it better and making their clients happy. That makes me loyal. Their customer service is legendary. That also makes me loyal.  I hope this review helps
It's rare that I 'buy into' a company like I have Amazon.  I have the Kindle, Fire TV and now the phone.  What's not to love about Amazon Prime?  I'd rather have my skin ripped off and be dunked in salt and vinegar than to live without Prime.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>Dedicated camera button<br/>Excellent Sound Qaulity<br/>Good screen resolution<br/>Excellent performance with anything<br/>Awesome processing power.<br/>Love the amount of RAM<br/>Easy Integration with other kindle products<br/>Contact and Calendar sync across devices is amazing<br/>Excellent voice recognition (see blow)<br/>Excellent wifi and cell data connectivity<br/>Excellent camera quality (love the cloud storage)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>For the amount I paid for this device, I really expected it to be 'polished'<br/><br/>The interface is inconsistently themed.  The beautiful 'dark' theme for the home screen (like the Kindle) is amazing, however when you start digging into the default apps (dialer, email, contacts... everything else is a very bright background, as opposed to the dark.  I really wanted this to be a consistently themed interface... at least for the default apps... the result being, your eyes adjust to the main dark theme, and you go to call someone, send a text, email, etc. and Bruce Springstein invades my thought process (blinded by the light)... for the cost and hype I really thought this phone would be more polished and consistent with Amazon's otherwise wonderful design elements.  The perfect interface design would be to allow the user to choose between a dark and light theme, rather than being stuck with some dark and some light.  Very annoying; I almost returned it.<br/><br/>Voice commands:<br/><br/>The directions are not clear for voice commands.  I struggled with it for days, and support just wasn't prepared to answer questions.<br/><br/>I tried 'send text to name', (name being a name in my contact list)... tried all variations.  It would recognize the name and show the proper text on the screen, but kept saying the name was not in my contact list.<br/><br/>I discovered that in the contact list, there are 'fields' (e.g. Text Mobile, Call Mobile, etc.)... so when you hold the home button in for a couple seconds and you're ready to give your command, you have to say those words, "Text Mobile name" (name being the name in the contact list... or "Call Mobile"... and it works perfectly.<br/><br/>The voice recognition while composing texts or email or anything you'd normally do from the keyboard is nearly flawless.. excellent speech to text processing....<br/><br/>Other than those cons, I'm very happy with the phone and kept it... and I'm confident they'll get up to speed with support and firmware updates to improve things...<br/><br/>I'd love to be able to use the default apps, but I had to load the phone down with 3rd party apps to get some consistent theming going on... which, for the price, just shoudl nto be necessary.  I installed a dialer app, k9 email for the dark themed emails... I'm hoping they'll polish these themes on the default apps... to release it without it being really done was not wise... if it wasn't for my well rooted love for Amazon, I would have returned it.<br/><br/>Overall I still rate it all stars and look forward to updates.<br/><br/>Thank you for taking time to read.
Trying out new fire phone but now new to android os. I liked my fire phone but I hope one day I can installs Mozilla Firefox from app store when available. I know google chrome and i.e. may never happen since Microsoft and Google has there own phone. I handle all my shopping and personal business on my phone. Silk browser is fine for now.
I am a previous iPhone user, and my second line is a Samsung Note 3. With that being said, I am all things Kindle so I have waited patiently for a Kindle phone. I debated over waiting for a second iteration to be on the safe side. Obviously, I decided not to wait.<br/>The Fire worked right out of the box and I only had to wait 2 hours for it to charge to 100%.<br/>I liked the tutorial that started right away. Gave me a quick overview of the features.<br/>The only problem I had was texting to those that had an iPhone. It still recognized the number as an iMessage so all replies went to my iPad and iPhone (now working as in iPod basically) Finally after hours of searching for a viable solution, I removed the phone number from ITunes, and the iPad. Hopefully, this will help others who make the switch.<br/>As for the phone, it fits comfortably in my hand. Since it is smaller than the Note 3 but bigger than the iPhone, I am missing digits when I am typing but that is not the phone's fault.<br/>The phone I made was clear on my end and the receiver.<br/>For setting up emails, it is very clear which account the email is from because they are color coded. I really like that.<br/>Dynamic perspective is impressive! even the screen saver utilizes it. I place the phone on the table and just glance at it to see information.<br/>I am testing the battery length and so far so good. I had it off the charger all day yesterday and messed with it. At 9 pm, I still had 45%. In three hours of use, it is still at 88%.<br/>As for apps: the only issue I have is there isn't a Vivint app. I knew what I was getting into since I have two kindles. There is nothing that I feel I must have on the fire that the iPhone or Note 3 has.<br/>One of the things I love is that I use it to send my Amazon Instant Video to the Fire TV.<br/>I will continue to update since this is only day two of having the Fire Phone.<br/>Actually used Mayday for the first time: having trouble setting up voice mail. After he ran me through what I had already, he called ATT to help me. He was very courteous and professional!
I switched from iPhone to Fire because 1) I'm already with AT&T;, 2) I don't have many purchased apps, 3) wanted to try something new like dynamic perspective. It took me one day to get used to the gestures and Andorid system. But once I get used to it, the more I use the phone, the more I like it. I've been a two-year prime member and have been shopping almost everything on Amazon. This phone makes my life easier for reading, watching movies, and of course, shopping. I like the maps over google maps, and I like the idea of inventing three-panel interface. I also like the icons and the display. I feel it's a very premium device.<br/><br/>I understand it's the first generation phone, so I wouldn't expect it to beat Apple and Samsung's 5th generation devices. But I do like the design and the feeling when I hold the phone. The camera is awesome. I imported all the pictures from iPhone to Fire and could easily tell the difference in quality. Some of the suggestions I would give to the Fire OS:<br/><br/>1) I'm not able to create a folder/collection in the grid.<br/>2) Battery life is relatively shorter than other smartphones.<br/>3) I truly hope you guys to improve the carousel. I like the small touches brought by Carousel, but please either replace the recommendations with small touches in all the apps (not only the native built-in apps), or make the Carousel customized by customers. I don't like swiping through the carousel all the way down to the app I needed. Sometimes I just want to use some small touches but unfortunately the app I'm looking for is at rightmost. Or could we peek to scroll the carousel?<br/>4) Enable auto-scroll in Kindle books.<br/>5) Display the preview of emails/txt messages/details of notifications on the lockscreen. Right now I have to swivel to view them.<br/>6) I hope Fire could allow us to customize the right panel notification panel. I personally would want to add contacts and favortite sites to the right panel so that I could easily get access to those resources.<br/><br/>I hope to see this promising device and OS improve all the way to the next generation.
This is my first ever smart phone, and I have to say, despite some reviews, it is everything I need and more. The biggest thing it has going for it is - it is NOT an Apple product. Sound quality, picture quality, all are top notch. For someone who doesn't really like "smart phones" anyway, this is the perfect one.
I rarely reply to Amazon's request to review items but this time I had to do it.  I had decided to purchase the Fire Phone in spite of some of the scary reviews that have been posted but I'll admit some of the comments had me worried.  Let me first say that I have had no technical problems with this phone nor any problem adjusting to it.  My phone background is a bit varied.  The Fire Phone is replacing my Moto X and previous to that I had a couple IPhones.  Maybe because I'm used to both Apple and Android I adjusted more quickly who knows.  Here is a summary of what ISN'T wrong with the phone.<br/><br/>1.  It has not gotten unusually hot.<br/>2. The battery life is fine.  When I got to work today it was at 98% now at 3:44 it is at 82%.  Granted I dont use my phone that much at work.  I made a couple of calls, sent several texts and checked my gmail a couple of times.<br/>3. I've had no problem figuring out how to text/email/search web etc.<br/>4. I do not find flicking my wrist to be a horrific ordeal. (It you do I'd just swipe left or right because that works too.)<br/>5. I do not find sliding up to close apps any more difficult than a back button.  (This might be because I got used to it with apple.)<br/>6. I had no problem connecting the blue tooth to my car.<br/>7. I quickly found the mayday button; although I haven't had to use it.<br/><br/>Over all I think this phone is great and if you are considering one I would go for it.  Thanks!
I just took a trip to London and Edinburg with my new Fire phone and have had nothing but headaches with the camera. It continually crashes and freezes up. After taking photos, I can't access all my photos from the photo icon--just the ones taken within the last few minutes. I frequently get an error message while using the camera and have to restart my phone.<br/><br/>After seeing what my daughter's Samsung Galaxy does, I'm so very disappointed in the Fire. What does it have? A few "new" but not exciting features: Perspective is a great big "so what." It's not useful.  Firefly isn't needed often. Ummmm...well, it's just an archaic phone. I thought I'd be getting the best of the best when I decided on this phone, and now I'm hugely disappointed.<br/><br/>App availability is ultra limited. Of course as rivals, it's clear we'll never have the benefit of Google apps on the Fire phone. I should have realized that before I bought the Fire. And then there's just a bunch of other common apps that aren't available. For example, I can't get on snapchat with my adult children who all use it as the app isn't available.<br/><br/>I love Amazon for everything else... we shop almost exclusively through them because we live in Alaska, and the free shipping is awesome. We love our Kindles. We have Amazon TV now too, and like it. But the phone - well, it just sucks.
OK - you have reviews from true techies and I see today there was a major spate of reviews from people reviewing the cloud storage use of coal rather than the phone itself.  My review is just from a person who previously did not have a smart phone - and was pretty happy that way.  In fact, all those apps kind of scared me - I just wanted something to use as a - gasp - phone.  Then I decided I really would like to be able to check my email from my phone when I was traveling - and sure, there are a few apps (calendaring, weather, etc) that could be useful.  So I looked at the Fire Phone, fell instantly in love with its ease of use for dummies like me and bought one (directly from AT&T;, so I could look and touch the phone before purchase).  My husband decided he wanted one also.  I bought him one of the 'New User Guides'.  Haven't looked at it myself, because I actually haven't needed to do that.  I was pretty instantly able to do the basics and haven't needed the MayDay Button yet - although it is really nice to have it.  So no, I'm not pining over missing thousands of Goggle Apps; but after 3 weeks, I am still saying "I love you" to my Fire Phone.  It would be difficult to beat the ease of use and intuitive way you can figure out how to do what you want to do.  The camera is excellent, too,  I'm happy.
I'm pretty used to iphone and my galaxy tablet so it looked like this would be fun and exciting. I've had it a week now and I'm still glad I bought it. I admit, the free year of prime was the clincher for me. I work long hours and if I need a kitty litter box or a new blender, I don't want to waste my precious time fighting the crowds at the local big box store. I place my order and..Bam! Two days later it's waiting for me on the porch! Not to mention all the shows I can watch for free. The phone pretty much does what my 5s did but I had to download a call blocker and I didn't get to bring my itunes with me. There is supposed to be a way to change the format so you can play them on the fire but we couldn't get it to work for us (still got em on my iPad). The app thing that everybody complains about is not a problem for me because I'm not a big app hound. My bank app, my favorite weather app and others I like to have were available in the Amazon store when I checked during my research before I went and bought it. The firefly is impressive and I like the 3d. The monkey buddy is really cute! Your kids will like it when you need to keep them busy. Get it!
I love everything Amazon, so thought their phone would be the perfect integration of everything. The phone has some really good features, but in the end has more negatives than positives. The "Prime" music has very few albums and songs. They do not have an app for UBER, and as everyone in cities with UBER knows you just have to have that app. The interface is not user friendly at all, you have to flip out sub-menus to do anything. I liked the screen, camera, and Apple should seriously consider buying Amazon's maps because it was my favorite feature. The main reason I returned the phone was because the battery is drained so quickly. I am not a person who uses my phone very much. I had to charge it twice per day. I changed the screen settings and that helped a little bit, but I knew that if it was draining so much brand new that in two years it probably won't even hold a charge for longer than 5 minutes.<br/><br/>I had a horrible time switching out phones, because you have to return the Fire phone to Amazon, but you only have 14 days to return the phone to AT&T.; Since I had switched over from Verizion, I would have lost my phone number if I didn't buy a new phone and have AT&T; port it over to the new phone.
I've been waiting to write a review about the new Amazon Fire phone until I really had a chance to try it out for a while and see how I like it. I've had this phone for a little over a month now, and I have to say I've never liked another phone better! I switched from an iPhone 4, but other than liking iTunes setup on my computer, I was never really thrilled with that phone. Now I will also gladly admit that I'm not someone that have dozens of apps. I never have as I'm just not into that sort of thing. I mostly use my phone for email, internet browsing, facebook, and some texting. What I LOVE about the Fire phone is that it is JUST like my Kindle Fire - and I've grown to really like and enjoy that as I've used it as well. So if you are dead set on what you use from the apple store or you're hardcore about google play, then no, you probably won't care too much for this phone. As all Kindle users know, Amazon's available apps are not from either of those - they have their own. I easily replaced the few apps I used the most with comparable (or better) ones on my Fire phone. I also really like the dynamic screen - it's the one thing my kids really like messing with too!
I purchased the new Fire phone as a loyal Amazon customer.  I've been very happy with my Kindle Fire and I wanted the same first class technology.  Also, the Fire phone allows me to bring my Amazon entertainment content with me (movies, music, games).  As a disclaimer, I also have the Fire TV, Kindle ereader and Fire tablet.<br/>The 3D technology is pretty cool and I've been playing the Saber's Edge game constantly (I'm addicted to this game).  My favorite feature is the camera.  I have a new baby and the pics have been amazing.<br/>The Prime Music benefit has been a surprised highlight as well.  I'm able to play classical or children's playlist for my son and rock music for my workouts.<br/>I typically just use my phone for camera, GPS, e-mail, web searches, music, games, calls and texts so I've been very happy with my purchase.  As a side note, I was already an AT&T; customer so I purchased the phone instead of upgrading or "NEXT" or 2 yr contract.  My phone bill stayed the same.
I have been an Amazon customer and prime member for over two years now and when I heard about their phone coming out, I was not hesitant to get it. I read negative reviews on every site but being an iPhone and iPad guy for 6 years I figured I'd try something different. So far with two weeks of owning this phone, Amazon hasn't disappointed yet. It has many cool features such as an interactive 3d lock screen, firefly which recognizes a lot of shows, music and objects that takes you to Amazon to buy (very smart on their end), tap and drag keyboard which is very quick and convenient to type and works very well for texting, calls and good sound quality. Yes, it overheats if you're charging it and it's under a pillow or something (learned that last night) but it cooled down after I turned it off, and apps aren't as abundant as they are for Apple. But overall Id give this phone a 4.5 stars. It's not perfect but I am very glad with this purchase. Can't wait for Amazon to come out with their next.
Smooth running system, took a little time to get used to because it doesn't operate like previous Android systems. I think I like the differences though. I Like that it also came with a year subscription to Amazon Prime.
I love the phone, no clue why everyone is hating on it except maybe the battery life. The OS is refreshing, different than the boring and old jelly bean and ios. Awesome speakers, great mids and decent highs and lows, but for a phone, amazing. If you use amazon regularly then this thing is even more helpful, it tells you when your package is shipped and when its delivered, I like dynamic perspective. Although the one action required to bring down the toolbar can be a pain in the ass to get but all together this phone is new, not the same recycled bs from apple. Can't speak for Android but apple's iphones are a joke. I switched to this and love it. I will say getting Imessage to drop my phone number was a pain. All around great phone.
I'll start by saying that I am a very picky smartphone user, and that I have previously owned Samsung S4 and IPhones 1 thru 4. After two weeks of use, I like my Fire Phone better than any of my previous devices. I can't speak to how it compares to other recently released phones (S5, LG) or the upcoming iPhone 6. The phone is especially impressive when considering it is Amazon's first foray into smartphones. While I loved my first iPhone, it had quite a few annoyances that are to be expected when a company creates a new device. The Fire Phone doesn't have those same annoyances (of course I recognize that Amazon has had the benefit many years to let the smartphone market and experience develop). I would highly recommend this device, for those inside or outside the Amazon ecosystem.<br/><br/>Operating system - Amazon nailed it. So intuitive and easy to use. It seems like commands are always accessible and where I need them to be. If you own other Amazon devices (Kindle Fire or Fire TV), the seamless integration with the phone will be very useful to you. It is better than any OS I have used on a smartphone.<br/><br/>HW - Unlike other reviewers, I have had no problem with the battery. I typically end the day with ~30% charge and don't charge throughout the day. And while the phone does get a bit warmer than my old iPhones, it is definitely cooler than the S4. I don't understand all the talk about the heat produced by this phone. And while there have been negative comments about the screen, I have no complaints, but maybe this is an area I'm just not picky about. The processing speed of the phone is great. I never find that I have to wait for the phone to catch up with what I want to do. With all my previous devices, I HAVE had to wait. To me, this is especially impressive considering that this phone does MORE with dynamic perspective (that functionality has to take a lot of computing power). Finally, the industrial design is nice. It is a good looking device, feels very good in my hand (it is somewhat heavy, but I like it's weight...makes it feel more substantial than my S4 and more like an iPhone). Frankly, when I put my Fire phone next to my S4, I finally realized what an ugly device the S4 is. Of course, it will be hard to beat the upcoming iPhone 6...that thing will be beautiful.<br/><br/>Dynamic Perspective - it is amazing and it really works...well. This is a compelling feature, and a totally new technology. It will change the way we interact with our phones. Since apps haven't developed for it for the most part, it's not fully taken advantage of, but I believe it is only a matter of time. There have been reviews and articles calling it a gimmick. Either these folks have not used the device, or they have no vision. There is so much potential here...it's just not fully tapped.<br/><br/>Firefly - sure, it doesn't work some of the time. But, I expect that to improve as Amazon builds it's database. When it does work, it is magical. I have found it somewhat useful in the store or when I need to capture an email address or phone number.<br/><br/>ATT - not so bad. I was with AT&T; 3-4 years ago when their network was from the middle ages. Things appear to have improved dramatically, and there customer service seems to be quite good as well. I'm not missing Verizon as I thought I might.<br/><br/>Price - you get 32GB of memory and a full year of prime. Add those factors in, and this device IS cheaper than iPhone, S5, etc. For a device of this quality, this is a very good value.<br/><br/>App Selection - yes, this is a clear downside. No google apps. But, I frankly haven't missed them. My gmail/google calendar still sync seamlessly, and the Amazon maps app works just like google maps (though I have noticed that the traffic accuracy is inferior to google maps)
To state the obvious, this phone has gotten some really horrible reviews. I've never used an Apple iPhone or Samsung, which are the companies most reviewers are comparing to the new Amazon Phone. However, I have always used an Android operating system, which is the system most often desired by the other reviewers. As far as the comparison to the iPhone or a Samsung phone goes, both are companies that have had years to build up to the phones they now mass-produce. Amazon has just now started stepping into the phone business; it will only get better from here. You're comparing apples to oranges. As far as the Android operating system goes, I have yet to see any problems in that regard. I really have no idea what it is that the other reviewers are missing when they say this. I've been using this phone for a couple months now and have had easy access to anything and everything I've wanted from it.<br/>This is a great phone. The negative reviews on here, and on the AT&T; website, almost discouraged me from buying it. Now, I can't really say I paid full price...or at all...for this phone...I didn't. I got the two year contract with AT&T; so the phone would be $0.99, then I got $5 off because I also have my internet through AT&T...so; the phone was free. I'm all for that type of customer service. I'm thrilled that Amazon has started dabbling in the phone business, and I can't wait to see what comes next.<br/>The bottom line is that this phone is basically the Kindle Fire. Now it's smaller and you can make phone calls. When I first heard about the Amazon Fire Phone, my hope was that it would be exactly like my Kindle, but in "phone version." And that's exactly what it is; it met my expectations.<br/>A lot of negative reviewers say that they cant work the operating system on the Fire Phone...I'm curious as to whether or not they are Kindle Fire users. Any kindle user should find this phone to be enjoyable.
I really like how the Fire phone feels in hand, and did not have any trouble syncing apps and content from my HTC One.  Yes, non-compatible apps I had on my HTC could not be transferred, but anyone who has owned a Kindle Fire (or has done a bit of research on available apps before ordering) would expect that.  I'll readily acknowledge that I'm a long-time Prime customer and am definitely embedded in the Amazon ecosystem, so the overall experience would surely be different for those who are not.<br/><br/>Apps: Most of my "must haves" were available right away, and a few others were easily side-loaded.  However, not having a functional "One Bus Away" will definitely put a thorn in my side in the short term (developers, it's open source, please help a fella out!).  I've tried side-loading multiple versions of the .apk, but they all crashed right away (same happened with Dolphin, though Chrome works okay).<br/><br/>Music sounds great, and while I like the included earbuds (especially the flat cord and magnetic earpieces), they simply don't fit in my ears well... they are too large, or maybe just not a good fit for my relatively small ears.  They are not noise-isolating, nor are they advertised to be.  That is one of the reasons I typically opt for a different set of buds.  I've also used Bluetooth and the Fire paired up quickly w/o any issues.<br/><br/>Screen Resolution: C'mon, on a screen this small most of us would never know the difference.  I don't spend a lot of time doing "serious watching" on my phone, so the difference between 1920 x 1080 and 1280 x 720 is not meaningful to me.  You might notice this on your big screen, but compared to other phones I'd be surprised.  As a test, I watched the same scene from Game of Thrones using HBO GO on Fire phone and my HTC One (with volume and screen brightness on the same setting).  I must say I preferred both the sound - and believe it or not the picture - on the Fire.  The sound was louder and fuller at the same volume, and colors seemed brighter.  Again, I tried to set up the devices exactly the same prior to testing in terms of picture/volume settings, using the same version of the app.  I can't say my test is w/o flaws, but at least I tried!<br/><br/>I do miss the widgets from my HTC One - which compiled different news, sports, tech, entertainment, etc. articles from various sources, though I have not done any research to know if there is something similar for Fire phone.<br/><br/>Battery Life (in perspective): Okay, I must admit I was surprised when my Fire phone seemed to be hemorrhaging battery power the day I got it - but I think this was based partly on atypical usage (i.e. constantly messing with it bc I got a new gadget).  Through a routine day, including streaming music ~2hrs and browsing/texting, streaming occasional video as usual, I ended up with ~60% of battery life after 11 hrs.  My HTC One, which I got 14 months ago, would leave me at 40% for the same daily routine.  Keep in mind that this was with all of the Fire's "dynamic perspective" stuff enabled all day.<br/><br/>I have not used Mayday or Firefly, but I do find some of the "low motion" features pretty useful, though not perfect.  Being able to access certain menus by tilting the device right/left is pretty nifty, especially for commuters holding on with one hand and using their other to operate their phone; a quick thumb press and you're there.  This is also a situation where the tilting forward and back to auto-scroll comes in handy.  The bad news is that not a lot of apps (that I know of) take advantage of these features, and the auto-scroll can be a little finicky (too fast/slow - though that could be part of the learning curve for using a new device).<br/><br/>After nearly a week's use I'm definitely a satisfied customer, and am not pining for my HTC One.  For a first-time foray into the smartphone sector, Amazon has come up with an easy-to-use device with some unique features.  If you're looking for a clone of your current phone, you should probably just wait for the next upgrade to/release of your existing device... but if you're a Prime Customer and have uploaded music, etc. to Amazon's cloud I think you'll be super happy with the Fire phone, especially as the number of available apps increases.
ETA: After a half dozen soft resets, a bunch of dropped calls, blank screens out of nowhere, screen going crazy and going blank when I swipe it, and having to reboot my "software" twice (it's a phone, wasn't expecting to see that!)...this is not the phone for me. I will be calling AT&T; in the morning and getting a phone that doesn't make me want to throw it out of the window on a daily basis. Hopefully I can get a refund. Or some credit for having to put up with this nonsense. I lived and learned my lesson and went near-crazy with this POS "smartphone". It isn't reliable at all!! Oh and thank you, for when I was talking to my boss and had to restart it twice during the conversation. Thanks a bunch. Oh and I have had AT&T; for years, this is the phone not the network.<br/><br/>Original Review: I am still on the fence. I like it. With my review keep in mind I am not a huge electronics person, I buy them when I need to and that's that.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>~ I got a free year of Prime. Which I would have gotten anyway. So it basically made the phone $99 cheaper.<br/><br/>~ Graphics are great.<br/><br/>~ App Store is good - the games look amazing!<br/><br/>~ Camera is great, love the editing features<br/><br/>~ Call clarity is wonderful<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>~ Confusing. It took me a few days to get it down. Even then I had to Google a "manual" to figure things out. I am pretty tech savvy but this one stumped me. Even after I watched the demo a few times.<br/><br/>~ The phone can get REALLY hot sometimes. Especially while playing a game.<br/><br/>~ It is a bit tiring that my phone keeps recommending books, etc. from Amazon. I get it, it is from Amazon, you need to advertise, but really? Recommending every book I looked at/browsed through/thought of on my phone?? It's overkill. And annoying.<br/><br/>~ Too much going on. Some features are unnecessary. It needs to be streamlined a bit, be more user friendly. The concept is great but the outcome is so-so.<br/><br/>Bottom line, I like it. I don't love it. I thought I would but it is too much, too confusing and just doesn't 100% work for me. And I'm stuck in a new 2 year contract. Silly me.
I am Kindle fan and my whole family owns Kindles. Except for the newest Kindle we have had every generation. Being that as it is I am aware of the differences in the devices. I have owned Iphones, Androids and Blackberrys. This phone is a great disappointment. I can honestly say I regretted buying no more than a hour after laying my hands on it. I will list Pro's and Cons to be fair.<br/><br/>Pros: -Cool 3D display but really isn't all that helpful. Good for showing off to your friends.<br/>-Great camera. Allows for panoramic shots and the clarity is very nice.<br/>-Descent Battery life.<br/>-Firefly is cool but gets boring quick. Failed to identify easy media selections.<br/><br/>Cons:- Muddled interface. Quick launch icons on top instead of bottom like every other phone I have used.<br/>-Ringtones are a pain and it's 50/50 chance imported ringtones will work. Poor default collection.<br/>-Poor App support. No BoA app, No Zedge, Crappy Craigslist app. Most of the apps I used on my Galaxy are not available. No support for any Google products or services.  Hell apps I used on my Kindle are not available either. Fire OS is a Android based OS. Common sense would dictate open that market to their customers, not happening they just don't care. The only way would be to Root the device, not a good idea. The Fire OS is just different enough to screw with some apps and updating will be a pain if even possible. Maybe someone like the guys who created Cydia will help.<br/>-Music search doesn't work well.<br/>-Very little customizing available.<br/>-Inconsistent call volume<br/><br/>Before I get hate messages, I purchased this with realistic expectations, so far the phone fails to meet any of them. I have never been so underwhelmed in my life with technology.
I really actually DO like my new phone. I've read tons of terrible ratings on this phone and decided i would give it a try anyway. Before this, I was an iPhone user and BORED. No new updates really from each model to each model. I wanted to try something new since I'm not a religious Apple user. Here's what I have to say:<br/><br/>I think if Amazon continues to release software updates etc JUST LIKE THEY HAVE FOR THE iPHONE, this phone could get to a place where everyone will be happy.<br/><br/>When I first got the phone out of the box, the new software wasn't downloaded (as what happens with Apple still, etc.), but I couldn't double click to close open apps like in my iPhone even though the Help section said I could and I couldn't get out of Apps (since there it no back button), BUT after the update, I can do all of that. To back out of something, I just had to swipe down.<br/><br/>No, not every app is available but the guys at the AT&T; store said you can get any app if you just type the app name and .apk after it and download it on your device. I'm not an avid app user so that doesn't really matter to me : I have Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, GoodReads, Flickster, Firefly, (some games I had on my iPhone), YouTube, Flashlight, Netflix, WWE, Spotify, and most importantly my KINDLE (eBooks).<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>Screen Shots are still available, just hold the Volume down button and power button.<br/><br/>The Lock Screen backgrounds are captivating. Really awesome.<br/><br/>Having Firefly is amazing : You can scan music playing and it pops up with lyrics, the sing to buy, album, concerts and for movies, imdb info, actors, etc.<br/><br/>When reading an eBook you can swipe to the right to bring up window that shows Who Characters Are which is awesome and an easy swipe back.<br/><br/>The cameras are nice and I take A LOT of pictures<br/><br/>Mayday help is really convenient.. someone just pops up on your screen (they can't see you) to help you with phone functionality.<br/><br/>Stylish sleek phone with super crisp screens.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>The battery life could be improved (the software update helped), it's just a very vivid phone so if you're using everything it has to offer, you're going to eat up battery. I always charge my phone midday at work so it doesn't bother me, but I would like to see it improved.<br/><br/>I would like the option of a back button or an app back button on things so I could either swipe down or back button things.<br/><br/>Changing my background photo on my phone (not lock screen). Can that be done? Haven't figured it out yet.<br/><br/>Not all apps are here yet. It's new, so they should work on it. The main ones though are so it's fine for me for now.<br/><br/>Take this review for what it is, but I'm keeping my phone. I'm tired of my iPhone and this seems like a really good fit for me being an avid reader.
I've had my fire phone just over a month now. For the first few days I was convinced I'd be trading it for another android. I fumbled through normal operations and the phone didn't seem to offer basic features and conveniences. With a little perseverance, I discovered it did have the features I was missing, I just hadn't figured them out. For instance, back. Took me a week to figure out how to go back a screen. Had I taken the time to watch the intro video, I'd have learned sooner. Same with time stamps and other things the 'peek' feature shows.<br/><br/>I wasn't happy with the existing email app, but found a good one in the app store. I think it was $3, but the free coins I got with my purchase paid for it -- as well as a few other apps. I'm not a big phone app user, so I haven't found many things I miss, but I'm sure many will be disappointed with the selection. I do miss Snapchat. :(<br/><br/>The DP I can take or leave. Beyond the 'wow' factor, it's pretty useless. Firefly is handy. I also like the visual voicemail feature.<br/><br/>I find the carousel clunky, but I don't like it on my Kindle, either. Instead I use the home screens, so no biggie there.<br/><br/>The phone is on the heavy side. If I'm wearing loose pants and have the phone in my pocket, I have to keep hitching up my trousers. I affixed a screen protector and have had no issues interacting with the screen since then.<br/><br/>The tilt screen is a little goofy. It works for some screens, but not others, like Kindle (where it would be most useful). Occasionally the home button doesn't work and I have to restart the phone, but I had the same problem with several androids -- they'd run out of steam, memory, something, and needed a little nudge in the form of a reboot. Same problem. My Kindle does the same thing, so I guess I should have expected this.<br/><br/>The keyboard and texting are a strong feature. I swipe text and use the microphone and both are comfortable and work well.<br/><br/>The camera takes fantastic pictures. The 'pinch' zoom takes some getting used to. My Sony used the volume buttons. I haven't taken any videos yet.<br/><br/>I use the music player quite a bit and the sound quality is excellent. Not totally thrilled with the music player, but I haven't gone looking for a different one. I've watched a few videos and the picture quality is very good.<br/><br/>AT&T; sent me to their website to transfer my contacts, but they weren't set up to accommodate the Fire. I don't know if that's changed. I still haven't transferred all my contacts, but maybe it was just time to clean house.<br/><br/>Battery hasn't been an issue so far, but then I'm not on the phone all the time.<br/><br/>What I miss most: Snapchat (as I mentioned); notification light (if I miss a call or message I won't know until I wake the phone up *this is what cost the Fire a star); emoticons within messages; can't block any numbers or automatically send them to voicemail; no main screen background. For those complaining about no Youtube, there is now a Youtube app, and I'm sure more apps will find their way to the store over time. Amazon is pretty good about responding to the demands of their users.<br/><br/>I was already locked into AT&T;, so no arguments there. The way they have it set up, the Fire didn't cost me any more than most of their other phones would have. WiFi works well, which is more than I can say for my Kindle lately.<br/><br/>So, after a month of use, I am satisfied and glad I kept the phone. I have no doubts that Amazon will continue to improve the device and offer users more helpful features. It's probably not for everyone, but it will work just fine for me.
This phone is awesome. Don't listen to the 1 star reviews, 90% of them are just spam attacks on the manner in which Amazon's cloud data center is powered. I doubt they even own this phone.<br/><br/>The dynamic perspective feature is very useful. As a note, I've heard some people complaining about the lack of a back button. To go back, just swipe up on the bottom edge of the screen.
I have enjoyed the fire phone and recommend it. This phone has some good things going for it. One of my favorite features is the camera and picture sharing. When I take a picture and connected to WiFi all those pictures are loaded to cloud storage (for free) which if you have a kindle HD it can view and download effortlessly. My wife plans to get a fire phone for her self so we can share pictures over the phone with out having to send them over text. If you have a kindle HD your app's that you downloaded can also be shared to your phone including paid app's, if it's the same account. A perk is when the phone is locked, with a push of a button I can fire up the camera quickly and painlessly as opposed to unlocking the phone the loading the camera. The pictures the camera takes are great. There is a feature if you hold down the camera button it will take a hundred pictures in a minute, great for action shots. With free cloud unlimited storage for pictures I can delete and edit later. (Caution, it's not unlimited for video)<br/><br/>The fire phone has a battery life. Anyone should know that batteries lose their effectiveness over time, Regardless of what phone. I have seen all my friends, relatives and co-workers bring a phone charger with their phone. I think this has a decent to good battery life. From dead phone to charge takes less then a hour on the 5w charger.  A three foot long cord is also supplied with the phone making it easy to attach to a plug in.<br/><br/>App's. If your coming from another another app store like Apple or google, your not going to have the same selection in the kindle app store. If there is a app that you can't live with out, check out the amazon app store to see if it's there before getting phone. I'm happy with what app's amazon has. If their was a app that did my dishes for me I'd be incredibly happy but there's not. I'll keep checking though.<br/><br/>The phone feels good in my hand. It feels solid, sturdy even. The display is crisp, sharp and fantastic.<br/><br/>Phone calls made with the phone sound great. The speaker on the phone is solid. I can blast music in my living room comfortably.<br/><br/>The firefly app is very useful. Not only can you identify music and movies but record names and numbers into your phone. Think business cards and hand written numbers. When shopping I can comparison shop when I think I can get a better deal online. It's only a touch of a button even if your phone is locked. This is a great feature for me.<br/><br/>If you have a amazon kindle, the fire phone go hand in hand. I was not expecting this when I purchased the fire phone. I do not own a fire tv or fire stick but if I do purchase one my phone could be used as a advanced remote.<br/><br/>A few complaints.<br/>1. Internet browsing is not as effective as it can be. When I change web pages, I sometimes have problems getting the address bar to come up or closing a web page to open a new tab. This is annoying. There is a feature which I had to turn off that with a tilt of my phone up or down I could scroll up or down. There is no way to control the sensitivity of this. If reading a article I put my phone down and pick it back up its scrolled to the bottom losing my place.<br/><br/>2. Swiping. I have a two and three year old. They enjoy playing their games on my phone. Problem comes from when you swipe from the bottom of screen to up it takes you back a menu or previous running app. even in a game. So they get frustrated when they play and swipe all to often and I rescue my phone before they throw it. They love drawing and coloring app's.<br/><br/>3. AT&T.; Amazon prime is heavily integrated into this phone so a decent data plan is needed if you don't have WiFi. I would use amazon prime music at work but AT&T; data plan is expensive. Even watching prime tv away from home is next to worthless with out a good data plan. Unless you spend a lot of money on a data plan, prime on the go is almost worthless.<br/><br/>4. Dynamic view. Until they come up with more app's this simply feels like a marketing gimmick. It's a fun concept but has little value at the moment.<br/><br/>Overall I would recommend this phone. I plan on buying another fire phone. I would urge you to consider this if your shopping for a new phone.<br/><br/> Why I gave it only four out of five stars is all this power is limited by your data plan a WiFi connection is a must. The swiping can be fine tuned but not a deal breaker. This is a great first attempt from Amazon and I hope they do another attempt at making a phone.
I actually really like this phone.  I had an iPhone 4s before this one, so maybe I'm not on the electronic cutting edge.<br/>Things I like:<br/>Carousel - it is easy to skim email, text messages, and phone calls without having to open the app.  More useful than it sounds.<br/>Tilt - was a bit awkward at first but very useful, especially for flashlight, blue tooth, wi-fi, and alerts.<br/>Lock screen - is this lame?  I love them. The graphics are beautiful and the 3-d is cool.<br/>Camera button on the side.  More intuitive for me than going to the camera app.<br/>Amazon Instant Video - I can watch movies/tv, or my kids can watch tv episodes when we are caught out and about.  Plus it must be some kind of fancy video app, since I can touch the screen at any time and the actors names or trivia will pop up from imdb.<br/><br/>Things I don't like:<br/>Lack of apps.  This does not seem to be improving.  I use the wallet for my coffee cards so I can still pay by phone, but I miss my starbucks app.<br/>Phone heat - this doesn't happen anymore, or I stopped noticing.  I have a cover, so maybe that helps?  But it was something that bugged me at first.<br/>Battery - better than the 4s but still not great.  Oddly, it's better now, but I still like to plug it in every day.<br/>Buggy - sometimes my phone gets slow, or my email doesn't respond as quickly as I expect it to.<br/>Firefly - what is it?  Sort of useless to me at the moment.  I tried to disable it but you can't.  Some apps you can't delete either.<br/><br/>Overall it's a great phone.  I definitely prefer to my iPhone.  However, I am not a gamer or tech junkie, just a regular mom and I use very few apps.  This phone fits my needs.  I like to browse the Internet, check and write email, text, call people, use Facebook, pinterest, read books, and listen to music.  It has plenty of storage so I can take lots of photos and videos of my kids.
I gave my wife my Samsung Galaxy 3 phone so I could buy the Fire Phone for myself. I am still getting used to the interface and I am becoming comfortable with the Fire Phone. It does most of the things my Galaxy 3 phone could do but the Fire phone does not support easy use of Drop Box or Google Drive which I use for cloud storage. I like the Firefly feature but on several occasions it did not recognize a product or a song I was researching. The map app is not as robust as Galaxy's or Google's but fairly usable. Overall I am satisfied with the Fire Phone. And as far as the whole DIRTY ENERGY controversy brought up by the environmental crowd, they can GO KISS ASS.
As a rabid Amazon fan, I've been waiting excitedly since the phone's announcement date and was like a kid on Christmas morning when the UPS truck arrived. It didn't take long to realize that the Bezos Santa Claus hadn't read my list this year and I tested it for about a day before giving up and returning it. I come from using a Samsung Galaxy 3 on Sprint and have a long history of Android usage, just for comparison but boy did I really want to like this phone.<br/><br/>The good:<br/>- The dynamic perspective is a truly interesting feature that works extremely well when one person is looking at the phone. It's weird and fascinating at the same time. Unfortunately, it's a great feature in search of a need since it's only used cosmetically throughout the interface other than Maps which we'll get into soon.<br/>- Mayday has near-perfect performance and will be familiar to anyone with a newer Kindle. It's a very functional support concept though you will need it a lot on this phone.<br/>- Firefly is fun to watch, if a little slow, though the biggest issue is reminding yourself to switch it on. It identified many of things I snapped, from a pack of gum to a copy of The Week, but it was less successful for TV and video. The photo piece works just like Amazon's scanning app on Android and the music piece is less reliable than Shazam. Still, this feature is good and should be packaged as a separate Android app to other phones if Amazon wants to ship something salable.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/>- After a brief tutorial on the user interface, I felt like I was using a Windows phone. There's too much scrolling and activity for the very limited options available in the carousel. Customization is also severely lacking. Basically, both Apple and Android have the navigation systems nailed so as a third entrant you'd have to be very innovative to improve those systems and the Fire Fly isn't in this respect.<br/>- The Amazon app store is like the Dollar Store next to the Costco - everything is sort of there but cheap and not very good compared to the real thing. I can live with that since I don't use many apps except - and here it is - the Google apps are all completely missing. If you use Gmail, YouTube, Drive, Google+ or any other services, this are completely 100% missing from this phone. The people who designed this phone must be out of their minds.<br/>- Additionally, the substitute Google apps are lousy. Once you sign in with your Gmail account, the native Amazon apps access attempt to replace Google functionality. Apart from UI being vastly inferior, these were all buggy - I had invisible emails, too many calendars and endless bogus alerts.<br/>- The native Maps app is a repeat of Apple's disastrous map fiasco. Yes, it has 3D views of tall cities, of which there are a handful in the US and hardly any in the rest of the world. More importantly, it's not Google Maps and the navigation is not Google. Somebody should have called Apple before committing to building their own maps since they just repeated all of the same problems.<br/>- The battery life is terrible. After 15 minutes of usage, the phone was hot to the touch. My wife's phone was the same, and then we watched the battery meters just plummet. Like the early days of the smartphone, this device won't go for 12 hours straight without a charge and that's when the battery is brand new. I can't go back to that.<br/>- It's very Amazon-centric. I order everything on Amazon, I'm their ultimate fan-boy and *I'm* saying there's too much Amazon on this phone. It's basically a Kindle with calling capability, but whereas I buy a Kindle specifically for the Amazon content, a phone needs to be a central point for a range of different services. I need my Gmail, I don't need to watch Caprica season one on Prime Video.<br/>- The design, as my wife put it succintly, is ugly. Really pretty ugly actually and I'm not even that fussy.<br/>- It's only available on AT&T.; Yep, that's right.<br/><br/>I'm bitterly disappointed that Amazon obsessed over a couple of admittedly cool technical features and then completely forgot about what customers expect from a smartphone. For most existing users, the lack of Google apps is a complete showstopper and the single catastrophic failure of this phone. For others, the clunky UI and poor battery will be major annoyances. I can't imagine anyone loving this device after using it for a while and certainly the moment I switched back to the Nexus 5, I felt instantly happier.<br/><br/>I think this is a disastrously missed opportunity for Amazon and first major misstep in their product line-up. The cell phone space needs more players but not another "walled garden" environment. Although I'm sure they're learn from this soon-to-be-announced epic failure, the big question now is whether the Fire Phone 2 can get people back.
You can't go wrong with an Amazon Fire Phone especially if you already own a Kindle Fire. It has speed, power, variety, connection to Amazon's cloud for storing books, pictures and music - not to mention a smart space age appearance that has drawn positive comments from iPhone and Samsung enthusiasts. Buy it with the Spigen Fire Phone Case to show it at its best!
I have to say I was a hesitant to purchase the phone, but since I am a heavy user of the Amazon ecosystem, it seemed like the right move.<br/><br/>After two days I can honestly say this is great phone...and I have had many including an iPhone 4, 5s and Galaxy s3. The build quality is nice...very similar to an iPhone. Processor is fast and the camera is fantastic. In regards to the battery life, I am going on day 2 and still have a 50% charge with multiple emails and a calender being updated regularly so I don't understand the negative comments as this is far superior to the 5s. The quality of calls is very good, something that my Galaxy really lacked.<br/><br/>Now where it really pops is the OS. Again I am an Amazon power user and understand the ecosystem so this is just an extension for me. It truly is like having my Kindle Fire in my pocket with constant access to my videos, music, pictures, books and newsstand. I also like the left and right swiping to give you more information.<br/><br/>The only frustration is that not all the Amazon Appstore apps are available, which seems strange, but am sure they will show up soon enough.  All this said, I think people forget that when you buy a smartphone you are buying into the ecosystem so if you are into Apple or Android, then keep using them.<br/><br/>However for my fellow Amazon and Kindle Fire users, this is the phone for you.
Bought this phone for my husband, who is hearing impared and wears a hearing aide.  This cell phone is rated the best for hearing aides and it is.  My husband was quite sure it wouldn't work, but it does.  As or daughter says, "It's amazing.  He can hear me!"  Highly recommended for folks with hearing problems.
I have had this phone for 5 days.I'm glad I did my research and didn't heed the advice of the nay sayers. This is the best smart phone I have owned. You can use Google and Gmail. You can not use the Google play store but the Amazon App store has apps galore. If there was some thing on Google you liked you will probably find some thing comparable. The camera takes crystal clear pictures even while you're moving. The designated camera button is a great feature, press once to activate the camera, long press to activate Firefly. This phone has a Fire os, so there is a bit of a learning curve but if you put some time and patience into it you will appreciate this phone. If you love Amazon you will like this phone. It has 32 gigs of memory. I have no problem with the length of battery charge or with it heating up. Being able to add a pic to your text just by flicking the phone to open the photo gallery is great.  Getting a free year of Prime makes this phone an incredible deal. Now you can buy it unlocked so you can use it with an alternate carrier. I think the fact that Amazon is donating 1000 of these phones loaded with an Ebola app to Drs to help fight Ebola in W. Africa is amazing. The Fire is quick and responsive. The home button lets you use voice commands like search the web, open a text, make a call. I'm really pleased with this phone. This phone has a lot of features and I'm finding new ones every day.
Very good phone and user friendly! Amazon rocks!!!
I'm a big fan of Kindle Fire, Amazon, and Audible, and being fed up with the lack of customer service from the almighty Apple, I jumped on the chance to try the Fire Phone.  Unfortunately there are some bugs Amazon needs to work out.  While I do like the larger screen size (for reading, of course), access to Amazon Prime videos, etc. all on my phone, there are a few major things lacking in this phone.  If those are the only things that are important to you, you will love this phone.  For me, there are a couple of really important things I miss from my previous (traded in) iPhone.  One of the deal breakers for me is the capability of it working with my car.  I was able to simply plug in my iPhone in the usb port of my Equinox and listen to my music or audible books through my car's radio.  While that happened the first day I got the phone, it stopped working the 2nd day and I haven't been able to get it to work yet.  A call to Mayfair resulted in a tech ticket being submitted for the problem they couldn't resolve and a promise to call me back that Friday with an answer to where they were on the problem.  I never received the promised call back.  I will be contacting Mayfair again about this issue, but so far it seems it has not been resolved.  (Apparently they are having this issue on some, but not all, other vehicles as well.)<br/><br/>Another HUGE issue I have with this phone is the calendar.  I loved being able to enter dates easily on my iPhone calendar and to simply invite by telephone number (or email) members of my family or others to those calendar dates.  I also liked being able to add reminders 1 or 2 days or so before the calendar date.  Image my surprise when I went to set up my calendar and found that I couldn't, because it currently only worked with certain calendar types.  So if your email service and calendar isn't one of them, you are out of luck.  You are directed by Mayfair to download one of the free calendar apps of your choice.  I did, and the app did not have settings that were easy to see on the phone (they appear easily on other phones, but apparently the settings screen doesn't stay visible for this app on the Fire Phone).  I ended up entering all my dates in Google's calendar through my computer (since the app syncs with Google calendar), which allows for inviting someone by email, but not by phone number, which would be my preference.  Also, not that great, since I'm having to do all of it from my computer instead of my phone.  At any rate, I'm less than happy with this subpar alternative to a calendar from what I was used to on the iPhone calendar.  The calendar should be a stand-alone item like the iPhone calendar.  You should have to sync it with ANYTHING, and it should be awesome.  Come on, this is AMAZON, and this phone wasn't cheap either.<br/><br/>Another drawback for me is the Android apps.  Perhaps there are a lot of people that love them, I don't know, and I'm glad there are people who do, but it's just not for me.  Perhaps if I never had an iphone I wouldn't know the difference and would love them, but compared to the number of and quality of the apps for iPhone, what I've seen so far (and previously even on my Kindle Fire), I'm not real thrilled with the Android apps.  Oh yes, there are a handful or 2 that are just like the major apps you find on iPhone, but that's about it.  After that, there's a lot of the Android apps that just aren't that great.  They do not offer the variety, and more importantly, the quality you get in many of the iPhone apps.<br/><br/>Also, one thing Amazon Fire phone needs is a comprehensive online tutorial for the Fire phone (not the little short one that comes with it that doesn't tell you much).  It should also tell you how to set up basic things on some of the apps that come with the phone.  Going through all the little subparts of the guide to try to find what you are looking for is very inefficient.  It took me quite a while to learn how to use this phone, and there are still parts of it I'm trying to learn.  The self-read guide that comes with the phone also is not well indexed as to how to find certain things.  The topical names do not always seem to match what in particular you are looking for, especially in some of the advanced features, and it takes forever to find some of the things in it.  Yes, Mayfair is handy, at times, but sometimes you are in public areas or otherwise where you can't be speaking to someone on your phone, but need to know how to work some aspect of it, thus accessing Mayfair is not always the best solution.<br/><br/>That said, I still have faith in Amazon.  One thing Amazon has been good about for the most part is listening to its customers.  I can only hope they will do so with this phone and make the changes needed, because it could really be a SUPER phone with just a few changes like that.  The amount of space you get with it is phenomenal compared to the iPhone.  But unfortunately for me, the space is not making up for the above issues.  I never thought I would be, but I'm really sad that I traded in my iPhone now.  I really miss my iPhone calendar and the ability to listen to my books in my car's radio where I can hear it easily while I'm driving.<br/><br/>Update:  Amazon called me to talk to me about the review and the specific issues I was having with the phone, and seemed genuinely interested in feedback regarding what was great and what might need some tweaks.  My guess is they will work on it, and like the Kindle, it will just keep getting better.
First, let me say that I am an Amazon fan all around. Ever since I bought my Kindle Fire HDX 7 I've been hooked on the Amazon ecosystem. I would say that I am exactly the type  customer that Amazon intended to market this phone for.<br/><br/>The Fire Phone is one of the best phones I've ever owned. With the quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM, it's a snappy, quick, phone. Very responsive. The video quality is excellent and it always feels fresh on the 4.7 inch screen.<br/><br/>Personally, it feels like  5 inch Kindle Fire with a little more diversity. It's meant for those who are familiar Amazon's OS and ecosystem and works best with a prime Membership.<br/><br/>The one flaw I've experienced was with one of the Fire Phone's main selling points. "Dynamic Perspective," while being very cool conceptually, isn't practical and slows the operation of the phone down significantly. So, I just chose to turn it off.. no skin off my back!<br/><br/>So, buy it!  You won't regret it!
It is the first smart phone that I had that didn't make me feel like a totally idiot!!!!  I love it.
Out of the box I loved this phone immediately.  Let me say for the record I'm not a fancy phone feature person, in other words I just want a phone that makes it easy to call and send texts.  The Fire Phone has changed my mind.  Previously I owned the Samsung Galaxy and honestly I wanted to throw it against the wall because I couldn't figure it out.  Within minutes I figured out how to put the Netflix app on, set up my email and send out my first text message.  For someone who has never seen the need for a fancy phone this was mind blowing.  I love taking pictures and the Fire Phone makes them amazing!  Again back to my Samsung, it never had that type of quality!  An obvious plus to me (since I'm an author and a book worm) is having the phone double as my second Kindle. So far I LOVE THIS PHONE!
Amazing and as easy as the iPhone to use except with superior features.<br/>The firefly feature is fun, and the camera takes fabulous pictures and videos.  Was going after the galaxy 5s until I saw the fires options in action the I was sold.
Amazing phone!  For all you 1 star gamers complaining, go buy the iPhone gaming system.  I travel international every week in Latin America and the connectivity blows away my old Samsung Galaxy.  I need a business phone and not a hand held gaming system.  My Galaxy wouldn't even sync my email when I was traveling abroad but the Fire Phone is syncing without fail in Mexico, Central America and Brazil.  Easy to use and email is perfect.  Stick with it Amazon.  You have a WINNER but it will take time to penetrate the market. Don't let me down and bring it!!
There have been a lot of ridiculous reviews for the Fire Phone, which I find pretty disappointing.  I feel like a lot of the bad reviews (aside from the hundreds of spam reviews about renewable energy) are coming from people who are just not taking the time to really use the phone.  If you go into using the Fire Phone expecting an iPhone or a Nexus or something, you won't be getting that.  To me, though, that is the point of the Fire Phone...it's not meant to be an iPhone or a Nexus.  It's its own phone.  I've had mine for about a month now, and I love it.  While it's clear that this is Amazon's first phone, it has opened up the door for some really amazing features in the future.  Personally, I have loved every aspect of dealing with Amazon thus far, and this phone is no exception.  The new features are pretty cool, especially Firefly.  Here are some of my observations that hopefully will help some people in their decisions about whether or not to go with the Fire Phone:<br/><br/>1.  Some people have said that the dynamic perspective is just a gimmick, but this simply isn't true.  It's used for some of the scrolling features, and helps the phone adjust to how you're looking at the phone.  Some of the stuff is just for fun, such as the home screens and the apps tilting, but there are useful ways that dynamic perspective comes into play.  For instance, the Amazon app allows you to just tilt the phone slightly toward you to zoom in and out on a product image.<br/><br/>2.  People have complained about the lack of apps, but this is clearly because people don't know how to use the phone.  While you can't use Google Play apps, it's true, you are able to still get apps outside of the Amazon App store.  You can look up how to do it online; it's fairly simple.<br/><br/>3.  I have not had issues with the battery life.  I read a review today claiming that some phones last for two days with heavy use, but that sounds like bull to me.  I'm able to go an entire day, using my phone regularly, and still have a charge at the end of the day.  While I do charge it everyday, I don't agree that it is any worse than other smartphones that get heavy use.<br/><br/>4.  I was able to transfer my music, videos, photos, etc. from my iPhone in like three minutes.  It was very simple, so I don't know why people are acting like it's impossible.  There are instructions right on the Fire Phone product page!<br/><br/>5.  The one complaint that I have is that the notifications for apps are not the greatest.  I think this harkens back to my iPhone days where notifications would pop up everywhere.  The notifications on the Fire Phone are a bit too subtle sometimes, and I will often not realize I have a new message or Facebook notification right away.  I am going to do more digging to see if I can remedy that.<br/><br/>6.  Lastly, the tilt/swipe functions are not as finicky as everyone says.  I've realized that it takes a bit more of a gentle touch to get them to work properly.  You don't need to shake the phone much at all to get the side menus to pop up.  If you do it too hard, then that's where the problems arise.<br/><br/>So, overall, I have had a great experience with my new phone so far.  Don't let the bad reviews turn you off to this phone.  It takes some getting used to after switching from an iPhone, like I did, but I feel like I've picked up the tricks after playing with it for a while.  I would recommend it, if you're looking to branch out...especially if you're an avid Amazon user!
Wow I thought what a great deal on the Amazon Fire phone boy was I wrong. I just received the phone Wednesday night September 10th. Im not happy with the purchase. It gets extremely hot for no reason I had the phone on for maybe 25 mins and it was burning my hand. Also if you are use to Android phones this is definitely not the phone for you. Maybe I will check it out again in the future if its still around. I'm definitely sending it back its so not worth the $0.99 I used to purchase it. I should have read the reviews first so my mistake I know better next time. Oh by the way I love Amazon just not a fan of this phone :(
I don't understand why there is so many negative reviews for this phone.  I love this phone.  I would buy it for my family and friends.  It is so easy to use, has loads of features.  I love the Firefly, especially when I am in my car listening to a song and it doesn't list it depending on the station.  It has recognized the songs every time.  This is easily the best phone I have ever used.  I don't ever want to change back.  The camera is amazing.  So many apps and many that are not available on other phones.  I have not found a single game or app that I used on my old smartphone that has not been available on this one.  Plus the benefit of a new app being available for free each day is wonderful.  Love, love, love, this phone.
Wasn't really interested in swapping apple for this yet even though I have a Kindle Fire HD, and normally I would feel guilty rating something iIhad not bought but the clowns who made it impossible to use the rating system to help judge the product changed my mine. Amazon you need to delete the form letter 1 star reviews. It's not censorship to keep people from screwing the system anymore than it is to stop voter fraud. It's an extreme disservice to your customer's to allow the system to be abused.
I've had my phone a week and a half. It was really easy to get used to. It's ease of use is something I've come to expect from Amazon tech. They didn't let me down. I love my phone!!
I wanted to adore this phone. I've been an amazon customer for the past 10 years or so. In addition to the fire phone, I have two kindles, use Audible and Prime.<br/><br/>I got my first fire phone with AT&T; Next. After 5 days, the phone started crashing (re-starting out-of-the-blue) and didn't turn itself back on. I returned it before the 14-day limit and got a second one. The second one had a camera issue (the back camera didn't work) and after a week of troubleshooting, Amazon sent a third fire phone as replacement- that's three in less than one month. The third one has now crashed in the same manner as the first one I got, it just turned itself off and won't turn back on. I just got off the phone with AT&T;, and they said that because the phone is under warranty, they cannot get me a new model, only Amazon could. Amazon then in turns says that they could only refund me before 30 days and now they won't refund the phone, they will simple just sent me another one (that's four, four since Dec 15 to now!). If that fourth one crashes: I just keep getting replacements, because the original 30 days have passed.<br/><br/>DO NOT GET THIS PHONE. If anything wait until: 1) It's been in the market longer and it's reviews have gotten much better and 2) They expanded their appstore (something I was willing to overlook, but now everything seems a little too much!).<br/><br/>The only reason it has a star (other than it's the lowest I can give), it's because the customer service personel was extremely apologetic and it seems like I'm not the only person with a crappy fire phone experience. I will never again sponsor a launch of Amazon hardware. The only reason I'm still a customer it's because I'm a big kindle user.<br/><br/>The return policy/ refund policy is completely ridiculous and unfair to the customer. It's completely unwarranted that I've had to go through FOUR. FOUR FIRE PHONE IN A MONTH A HALF and I won't get any replacement for another device. WHY!? WHY?! WHY!? My only mistake was not calling Amazon before today since the phone crashed a week ago (way before the 30-day limit) and now I'm stuck with a piece-of-crap device that better serves a paperweight. Extreme dissapointment doesn't even come close to what I feel or was left feeling after all this ordeal.<br/><br/>Worst device ever.
I wanted to like this phone, because I genuinely like Amazon; I buy most of my books and music from them. But it just wasn't to be. This phone is a first generation, and it shows with its multiple problems.<br/>There are several things I really enjoyed about this phone, including the mayday feature; Even though it ate my data. I loved the headphones. I love that I was finally able to download my movies I had purchased on Amazon, because they STILL don't have an option for that on anything other than a PC or Apple products.<br/>The alerts for my deliveries was handy. And the  fact that it came with a free year of Amazon Prime was a real draw in, considering they've recently upped the price by more than twenty dollars. But when I found out that the free music selection was limited and I could only borrow one free kindle book a month when at first they made it sound as if I got unlimited access, I was upset.<br/>The things I was solidly dissatisfied with are numerous.<br/>I wanted to use the ten dollars in free coins they gave me on music, but the only option was for games and apps.<br/>The autocorrect is an absolute pain in the ass. Usually auto corrects are annoying, but this one was a step up. I couldn't even use actual words without it correcting them to random things. I had a problem with I alot specifically for some reason.<br/>It only comes with about 25 gbs out of the box, when it says it's a 32 gb phone. When I called wondering where the rest of my storage was, they told me it was the system memory that was taking up space. I told them the system memory is in fact listed as only taking up approximately 300 odd mb; They were confused. I think perhaps if a phone's system memory takes up that much space, they shouldn't count it as the usable storage on the device when they market it. It makes it seem like they're not very smart, and are trying to short the customer. Seems like common sense to me. To be fair, the guy I talked to did file a ticket and call me back to say it was probably showing wrong and I could re-something-or-other-it. But I've since read other reviews with the same issues, so I don't really think it would have worked anyway. I told him I was returning the phone so I didn't matter and thanked him for his assistance.<br/>The phone is incredibly annoying and hard to navigate, and since I'm use to Samsung it's a rather large draw back that I don't even get a background image, let alone the option for picture frames on the screen.<br/>They have their own app store, which doesn't support Hulu, Youtube, or anything Google. Pretty much everything I use is tied to my Google account. They said that if I was really integrated in Amazon that in really wouldn't matter... that wasn't very accurate.<br/>They also have their own browser, which features Bing, and is truly not as good as Google or any other search engines or browsers I've come across. But maybe I'm biased.<br/>The phone overheats to an EXTREME degree, so the fact that the entire back is glass makes it extra uncomfortable to handle.<br/>It charges fast, and the standing battery life isn't bad... but I'd actually like to use my phone, that's why I bought it. The usable battery life is absurd. I've had to charge my phone at least three times a day. It drops a significant amount in just a few minutes. I had seen reviews saying that the battery life was subpar, but this is ridiculous. It says that I can turn off dynamic perspective to perhaps achieve a longer battery life, but considering that was one of the main reasons I was interested in the phone....<br/>There is no clipboard, so you can't go back and see anything you've cut or copied; It's all lost text. I looked up how to find the browser history on my phone, but only found out how to do that on a Kindle Fire. So it appears as if there is no browser history on this phone.<br/>It continually freezes and drops my webpages and apps.<br/><br/>This phone simply isn't for me. If it's the phone for you, fabulous, but be forwarned about the issues. Luckily I'm still within my fourteen day return period, so I will returning it today for the Samsung Galaxy 5. Perhaps I'm just a Galaxy girl at heart.
OK, seeing a lot of stuff that is negative so I thought I would take a minute.<br/>Simple to use.<br/>Mayday is AWESOME<br/>Amazon prime for a year? FANTASTIC- I am paying for my phone by watching free video and getting free shipping...oh and free music. Worth the cost.<br/>Phone has worked great and when it doesn't, support fixes it quick. Try calling Verizon and getting good tech support quickly, Oh yeah that is why I fired them.<br/>Best phone for me. I don't need apps that my Kindle Fire doesn't run and I don't need all the goo gas that the I phone thinks are needed. Love it.
i bought mine from AT&T;, not amazon.  love it love it.  i am a former trac-phone smartphone user.  i am an "old fart", never got into apps or anything like that.<br/><br/>all i know is everything i use my kindle for, plus email, calendar, text, phone, is right here in my hand.<br/><br/>if you know how to utilize your kindle then this is the phone for you.  I am totally in the amazon universe (all my music and movies are and have been  in the amazon world) and use my kindle exclusively. I was not entrenched in the Apple or Google world.
I usually am very dependent on online reviews when making purchases.  I was going to get an S5, but then I saw the announcement for this phone and because I have all my music in the Amazon cloud and I was interested in the free year of Amazon prime I decided to buy this phone.<br/><br/>After that I saw a lot the negative reviews online.  I was a little worried, but after owning it for a week I consider this the best smart phone I have ever owned.  My previous phones were Iphone 3GS and HTC OneX.  The concerns that I saw online and I still see from some of the reviews here are:<br/><br/>1. Poor battery life.  This phone has a better battery life than my previous phones.  With normal usage, emails, news, texting, words with friends, phone calls etc, I can make it through the day without charging with about 20% left.  I am guessing the reviews were made by people who use graphically intensive games.  If you play alot of games throughout the day you probably will have to charge up before the normal night time charge.  So I think the battery life is better than expected.<br/>2. Amazon appstore only.  All the apps I use except for TWC TV, and DallasCowboys.com are available.  The Bleacher report app that I found is actually better than the Cowboys official app.  Also the prices are cheaper with Amazon appstore.  When you buy apps they actually give you points back on many apps.  With the 1000 points that I got with the phone, I have yet to spend my own money on apps.  So far I really like the Amazon appstore.  I do hope they get the TWC tv app soon though, but it is early.<br/>3. AT&T; only.  AT&T; is what I use and it has the best signal here so this is fine by me.  I do hope they expand.<br/>4. Amazon OS.  This is my favorite part of the phone.  It is very simple to use.  I love the left and right panes and 2 top panes that you can make appear.  The very top pain is the Settings, Mayday etc and a flashlight and the lower top pain is the app carousel.  I do not know how to explain it but the look and feel of the OS is very intuitive and relaxing to look at.  Amazon has great UI developers.  I like the Amazon OS better than the Iphone and Android OS that I have used in the past.<br/>5. Hotness.  I saw one review that the phone gets really hot.  I use the Amazon Polyurethane case and I have not noticed it, but as I said in part 1, I am not a heavy or even a moderate gamer so this does not appear to be a problem for me.  My Iphone and Android would get hot too if I were using it really heavy.  This is definitely a non issue.<br/>6. No Siri alternative.  If you hold down the home key, you have voice commands.  I am not a big voice command user, but all of the ones that I have used in the past are available on this phone and the voice commands work well.<br/>7. Turn by Turn?  I did not know when I got this phone if this was available and I am glad to say it is available.  There is also an option to use a voice command in the Maps app to say where you want to go and the turn by turn works great.  I really like the maps app as well.<br/>8. Price.  I think this is a good value, you get free Amazon Prime for a year which is 99 bucks and that is a good value at 99 dollars, and you get 10.00 free apps.  It is cheeper than my last 2 smartphones where I paid 200 bucks and got nothing like that in return.<br/><br/>My favorite part of the phone is the OS.  It is very well designed.  The alerts/reminders are not annoying like other phones, but are relaxing instead and the OS is very intuitive and easy to use.  It will take a few days to get used to it, but you can still use it effectively from the get go.  I am now used to swiping up instead of using a back key in some apps.<br/><br/>Despite the naysayers, I believe this is as good as a phone as you can get right now.  I have been using the Amazon MP3s for some time and the music is cheaper than Itunes.  I got a year worth of Amazon Prime and I like the Streaming more than Netflix streaming.  I am catching up on Workaholics and some HBO shows that I have never seen.  I havent watched Amazon Prime on the phone, but I can watch on my TVs that have the Amazon app on them.  Also the Prime music is a good option.  I like the free playlists.  The Firefly feature and Dynamic features are really cool, but the best thing about the phone for me is the OS design.
Here is he start of what will be a honest ongoing review of the fire phone. I have had several iPhones and this is my first droid based phone. I have had iPads, kindles & a Samsung tablet.<br/><br/>Here is my review after 24 hours<br/><br/>After 24 hours I am pretty happy with the phone. The screen is nice. Takes good pictures. It was easy to set up my email. My only complaint with setup was with att (should have just walked into a store rather then over the phone). The battery did not last long on day 1 but that is too be expected. Phone was completely charged as of midnight & and now 20 hours later it still has 16% battery life.<br/><br/>So far my only issue isn't with the phone but rather with the Amazon App Store. Several apps just aren't available, for example directtv, redbox and sports teams apps. If those were available I would be giving a 5 star review.<br/><br/>After week 1:<br/><br/>Still a big fan of the phone. The phone is big but not so big that it won't fit in a dress shirt pocket, which is nice. Also the phone completely syncs with my car. I have seen numerous reviews saying that the phone wouldn't sync with their car through bluetooth. I have a 2013 Mazda CX-9 and it had zero problem connecting. It even downloaded my text messages which is something I was never able to do with my iphone. I was even able to stream Prime Music through the bluetooth.<br/><br/>I have noticed the phone gets warm but no more so than my last iphone. It has never been so hot that I have had to put it down or anything like that.<br/><br/>The biggest difference I have noticed with this phone is opening links in social media. The internet links will not open inside facebook or twitter, they open in silk. This doesn't really bother me either way but I could see how that might bother some people. So again my biggest complaint is the app store and lack of apps. I have even found some of the apps are available for kindles but for some reason are not available for the Fire phone, which makes no sense to me. Amazon really needs to open the gates to google store or get the apps themselves.<br/><br/>I haven't had a need to use the navigation/map much besides playing around with it so can't really speak that well of it. Once I do I will add on to this review in a week or so, maybe a month review.
I've been an avid smartphone user for these past three/four years, and am not entirely sure why this phone is disliked as much as it is. I'm absolutely loving it so far, although I must admit that the majority of the apps that I use are fairly standard across all the mobile OS platforms and there are some that people might like that are currently not available here. It has great call quality, a fantastic camera (with cloud storage,) and fantastic uses outside of just what the phone offers (i.e. the year of amazon prime, gaming, firefly and shopping discounts.) This is the first amazon product I've ever used, and the free year of amazon prime with a 99 cent purchase is what brought me under their fold. Yes, you are being brought into their infastructure, but if they continue offering such amazing deals and a product that runs as fast and smoothly as this I'll continue being a customer.
I've only had this phone for a day, so I reserve the right to change the star rating if I start to have issues. So, I'm coming from having a Windows 8 phone for the last two years. Before that, I had an HTC Aspire. Those are my smartphone experiences. My daughter has an iPhone 4s, and I am lucky to get the thing turned on.<br/><br/>I have a Kindle Fire HDX and the user interface on the phone is similar enough that I can navigate fairly easily. I think I'm going to like the auto-scroll, although at this point, it's still something I need to get used to. I can see it becoming an automatic action though. I had my 6 month old grandson over yesterday so much of my exploration was done with a sleeping baby in my arms. The scroll feature was great for one-handed use.<br/><br/>Voice to text worked flawlessly on a couple of text messages I sent. I love the camera and the camera app for editing. Firefly is cool and I have a feeling it will also be something I start to use as the need arises. The dynamic perspective is cool and I hope to have more uses for it as apps become available and such.<br/><br/>As far as apps go, I had a bunch already for my HDX and it was nice to have them all available on the cloud for downloading if I wanted. I'm not a huge app user. I would love one for my bank but the one my bank has stinks anyway--not Amazon's fault.<br/><br/>Since I am heavily invested in the Amazon ecosystem with going on five years as a Prime user, I love that all of my music, video and books are right there ready to use.<br/><br/>My only issue was that for a short time yesterday, the phone was heating up a bit. I don't know what that was about and it hasn't happened since. I will keep an eye on that.
I purchased through AT&T; and wanted to love this phone.  I am a very loyal Amazon customer and expected the phone to perform as well or better than the Kindle FIre HXD.  However, I did not feel that it performed even as well as the first Fire HD.  Another issue was that the phone reception did not perform as well as other smart phones I have used.  I returned to  AT&T; and went for a LG G3 that turned out to be a much better performing phone.  Feel that phone was released before it's time.
I really like this phone. It would be perfect if it was compatible with the most popular apps, if simple features like redial & smiley faces were one click and not an app, if the apps that are compatible actually worked. There's more about the phone that I like than I dislike & I like it more than my previous phone.
Kid yu not I love it
I am giving 5 stars and is you look at most of the 1 star ratings they are the same review written by the same person or group of people, most likely eco activists.
We have had our Fire phones for a month now. So far we really like them!  Despite having used iPhones for the past four years, we didn't use all that many apps. The Amazon App Store had equivalent apps for nearly everything we needed with the exception of onstar. For what we need in a smart phone, the Amazon fire phone does what we want. And the dynamic perspective is a fun feature, too!
An innovative new phone with some great potential. The dynamic perspective is a "first of its kind" technology that is very exciting. There are some issues with the OS where it occasionally lags behind about one second. The connection to amazon prime music and photos is a huge plus. For the current price, plus one free year of prime, it is hard to say no to this phone.
This is for Amazon. Don't give up on making a phone. This phone is actually pretty awesome. Firefly, amazing. Mayday, incredibly useful. Auto-scrolling on websites, the feature I never knew I needed and am now disappointed no other phone has. The camera is good and the integration into the Amazon ecosystem is as good as your tablets. There are features here that no other phone has and a lot to love. This is a really good phone.<br/><br/>Here's where it went wrong. App availability is too limited. For example, I can get an app from United Airlines, but not Delta. Add more mainstream apps from companies people interact with daily. Get more bank apps or similar. The phone runs Android, but it can't download Google apps. However, the lack of Google, Apple, or Microsoft apps is an ecosystem problem. I use an iPhone only because everyone I talk to regularly, owns an iphone. To get me off an iPhone means pulling me away from their ecosystem. You introduced instant video on the iphone. Now I buy movies/tv shows with Amazon. You came out with Amazon Prime Music. Goodbye iTunes music. Kindle app, no ibooks for me. Unlimited photo back up. No need for icloud storage. Here's what's left. Text messages, facetime, VOIP, shared notes for grocery lists. The trick here is to keep introducing apps that allow people to break out of their ecosystem. If I can do video calls as reliably and easily with iphone users as when using facetime, then  I won't be tied to the iphone. If you take the same approach to phones as you have with tablets you might find more converts. That is, inexpensive hardware with expandable storage. Sell it unlocked and not tied to a carrier. I bought the phone simply because having an inexpensive, unlocked, smart phone had value for me regardless of whether or not I could find a specific app.<br/><br/>The Amazon ecosystem is really good. Having a phone that integrates into the ecosystem will be valuable. You just have to make it easier to move from other ecosystems that are very well established. Don't give up yet.
I like it more each day.<br/><br/>There are features I wish were better. For instance when the phone displays a facebook notification in the slide down top menu it should be a clickable link that takes you too the actual app. Also, I think the phone display should come on to the lock screen when there are notifications so that I can just see what it is without having to open the phone and unlock it every time I receive a notification. Also, the carousel should have a massive remove from carousel option like the kindle fire does to make for quick straightening up of the main display. And the "remove app from phone" option should be removed from the carousel completely. It's too close to the other buttons and its annoying to accidentally click that button and have to reinstall apps. The hand gestures for pulling down the top menu and the side menus could be tweaked. Accidentally dropped the phone trying to flick out the side menu. The firefly button doesn't actually recognize EVERYTHING. It didn't recognize my cat. I like the display features on carousel items like recent text messages and phone calls, however, I think more thought should go into what is displayed there. When it's suggesting more games for me to play or other random books that I don't care to read, I just find it annoying at that point. But that feature is somewhat easy to ignore.<br/><br/>I really like the quick switch between apps button. I like the side menus with the weather and easy access to amazon books and things. I didn't know this before buying the phone but a really cool features is that when you purchase something through amazon the right panel displays information about when the item ships and delivers. And the voice recognition/voice command feature is the most accurate I've ever used. I'll be honest it took some time to get used to. But as I've learned the little tricks and features I'm really liking the interface experience more than any phone I've used before.
Alright, so I'm going to review this phone as honestly as I can.<br/><br/>Before this, I was a Wal-Mart phone guy. I had T-Mobile, and never owned a phone that cost more then $100. Most of them cost about $50. I figured that I am doing well enough financially to get an expensive phone, and I love Amazon, so I got the Amazon Fire phone. So that is the angle I am coming from.<br/><br/>So let's begin with the biggest issue I see about the Amazon Fire on other people's reviews. This being the battery. The positive and negative reviews about it are pretty much all true. When not at the house I use my phone as a pretty basic thing. I take calls on it, txt people, check Facebook now and then, and instragram a few photos. This doesn't do much to the battery and it will easily last me all day. When I get into using apps however, the battery really starts to drain. Naturally apps will drain any battery, but the Fire is very prominent. Luckily I found to curve this I use an Battery app that tells me when an app is draining my battery and lets me close it.<br/><br/>Next, a big thing is Dynamic Perspective. This is sadly one of those neat for a day things. When I first turned my Fire on and saw it I was like "Now this is cool and inventive" About 6 hours later I had disabled it. It is one of those features that is there, and doesn't really give or take to the overall phone. I think in the future that dynamic perspective may take off once it is more refined, for now though it's just a neat addition. Now there are features where if you tilt the phone to the right one menu comes up, to the left another, and swirling it makes the notifications show up. It's not a part of dynamic perspective but I do find myself using these features all the time.<br/><br/>Now I suppose we can go onto the phone itself. The OS and interface is between the basic Android phone and the Kindle Fire tablet. It takes parts of both and puts them together. It flows easily, I have no issue navigating it.<br/><br/>The amazon appstore has a lot of apps I use and don't really have any issues with it. Many complain it can't connect to the google play store, but that has not bothered me at all. This may be just me using Windows phones before this, which have terrible app support. Also all my music I buy through Amazon anyways so that made it easy for me.<br/><br/>The build is durable from what I can tell. I bought a case just as a precaution. I have not dropped it, and don't plan to drop it to test it, but if I do drop it, I'll update this part.<br/><br/>The camera is a nice 13mp with back and front facing cameras. It takes good pics. Honestly at first I had some issues with it. The camera would take forever to turn on, or it wouldn't turn on at all. It lasted about a day, and now it loads as soon as I press the button. Not sure what was up with that.<br/><br/>So all in all, not a bad phone. Some areas it could be improved in, but I am enjoying it. Overall I would recommend it.
I bought this phone from Amazon during a one day promotion for $189, with a year of Amazon Prime included. We use Amazon extensively, and renew Prime each year, so I figured the phone set me back $89. At that price point, and given that we are heavily invested in Amazon's ecosystem, I think this is a great phone.<br/><br/>I have a Kindle HDX, which I use for reading, watching movies (occasionally), and streaming music at the office and in the car. So, I have a large number of Kindle books, a fair selection of movies, Amazon Prime movies (of course), and Amazon Prime Music, as well as a large number of music albums I have picked up from the Amazon MP3 store over the years, and a number of Kindle apps I have secured over time, the great majority of them free (Amazon offers one free app each day, and often has an impressive collection of free apps available for a day or two). With the Fire Phone (this review is about the phone, after all . . .) all of my Amazon content is immediately available to me, and all of the Prime extras, in a light, fast phone with a great screen, terrific camera, good battery life, and some interesting extras (Firefly in particular). Navigation is quick and intuitive. Sound quality on calls on the phone is fine, and you can read your Kindle books, listen to music, watch a bit of a movie (on a small phone screen, of course) and play games. If you have used a Kindle Fire tablet the user interface is very similar; I find it elegant, though not revolutionary. A good, clean interface, with everything readily available.<br/><br/>How does the phone compare to other phones I have had? Call sound quality is good; speakers are excellent; the screen bright; the camera works very well. I would say that the Fire Phone does not stand out as definitely better, but is certainly comparable, to top of the line phones.<br/><br/>The real question comes down to ecosystem, I suppose. Amazon has a large selection of apps, with virtually all the big name apps covered, and a great number of which you can get for free over time -- more and better quality apps than for a Windows phone, for instance. But the apps selection is definitely smaller than for an iPhone or pure Android phone. If you are just starting out looking for a first phone, perhaps one of the other ecosystems would be a better fit with a somewhat larger selection of apps and, of course, a world of different phones with different screens, pens, cameras, speakers, etc. etc. However, if you have built up an Amazon library of digital content and can find a good deal on the phone, like I believe I did, this is a great value and a very nice phone.
Ok, So this review might be long, but I hope those of you on the fence about the Fire Phone will read it.<br/><br/>I am a digital artist and I use many different types of electronics for my artwork.  I'm first going to talk about APPLE, before getting to the Fire phone.  I'm going to do this because I want anyone reading this to know exactly why I rated this phone so highly.<br/><br/>I HATE APPLE PRODUCTS.  Yes, all caps.  I believe them to be completely overrated.  I don't use an iphone (but I did have one before purchasing the Fire phone).  I don't use APPLE computers...I built my own PC and it does everything I need it to do for my video work.<br/><br/>Here's the thing:  Apple is great at marketing, but never let an APPLE lover tell you that their products are superior.  This just isn't true.  Everybody else caught up.  The Android OS is just as good as the Mac OS;  Windows is stable (8.1 is the best they've put out in my opinion), I could go on.  I know this has nothing (on the surface) to do with the Fire phone, but it has everything to do with how much experience I've had with different systems and technologies.  Don't believe that Apple is the only product for video artists...they might have cornered the market for a long while, but PCs caught up and in some ways surpassed them.  You pay way too much money for Apple products.<br/><br/>Anyway, to the Fire phone:<br/>Look, as a few other reviewers have stated, if you are into Amazon, and a Prime member, and do cloud storage through them, then the Fire will make total sense.  Just like if you have an Iphone and are synced with their cloud and your Ipad, etc...it will all make sense.<br/>It's the same damn thing, just through Amazon.  So people complaining about this confusion are really just irritated that they aren't already synced through Amazon and an Android OS.<br/><br/>Next, the Fire phone is an amazing machine to look at.  I mean, the picture quality is incredible.  It is better than the iphone (I can't speak to every other type of phone, as I haven't owned all of them).<br/><br/>The Fire is intuitive and user friendly.  I figured it out quickly.  This has always been the problem with Apple products.  Not so with this phone.  But remember, if you are already familiar with Amazon (maybe you have a Kindle, you're a prime member, etc.), then the Fire will just be an extension of this.  It's basically a Kindle with a phone.  BTW, I own both a Kindle Fire HD and an HDX.  Everything is synced.  If you like your Kindle, then the Fire phone will make perfect sense because it's basically the same machine (again, but with a phone).<br/><br/>As for APPS:  Here is where I might disagree with some people.  I don't care much about apps.  I use some of them.  The Fire has plenty of apps and more are made all the time.  I don't really understand the APP craze, as most are complete garbage.  But the ones I use like Twitter, maps, video, different games, etc all work well.  I would like to see a better Podcast app from them, but the one I found works well enough.  It's just a little different than the iphone podcast app (which admittedly is pretty good).<br/><br/>Let me say this (IN SCREAMING CAPS):  YOU SHOULD NOT BUY A PHONE BASED ON APPS!  Why?  Because new apps come out ALL THE TIME.  Most are terrible.  Amazon is already improving on apps they've had for a while.  Like I said earlier, everyone caught up (and began to surpass) Apple.  Don't buy into the b.s. that a $400-600 phone is worth it because of the apps.  That's marketing nonsense.<br/><br/>Amazon prime music:  Freaking awesome.  BTW, I was offered prime when I bought this phone.  I already had it, but they upgraded it for a longer period.  I can't say enough about Amazon prime.  And their music selection is really good (if not great).  I've already got WAY more music on cloud my Fire cloud storage than I ever did on my iphone.<br/><br/>Amazon Prime is THE reason to buy this phone.  If you don't use Prime, you have no idea what you're missing out on.<br/><br/>And again, the phone looks fantastic.  The quality of the pictures is great.  The screensavers are actually quite awesome.  I actually enjoy my phone (whereas in the past I couldn't care less about my phone, including my iphone).<br/><br/>Like I said, this is an extension of a Kindle.  Think about it like that.  If you like the Kindle Fires, you'll (hopefully, probably?) like this phone.<br/><br/>It's user friendly, has BIG BUTTONS FOR THE KEYPAD (Thank you!), looks fantastic, and has all the apps I need.  It's lightening fast, btw.<br/><br/>Iphones suck.  People have them because they think that's what is best.  Of course some people will stand by that.  I don't.  I think Apple products are a giant marketing creation, and their products aren't all that great.  Especially when you consider how much more you pay for their "brand."<br/><br/>This phone rocks.  I'm a digital artist, I know how to work these machines, and it's the best phone I've ever owned.  That's partly because I'm synced with Prime already, yes, but I don't have a negative thing to say about this phone...other than I hope Amazon continues to produce them and doesn't quit.<br/><br/>Edit: I forgot to add... Amazon's browser, Silk,has gotten much better over the last year. That was a big issue when the Kindle first came out. Now, on both the new Kindles and the Fire phone, Silk works well. plus they dont have the privacy issues google has. I stay away from google chrome and google products because of this. Same with iPhone privacy. stay away.
Update: I am kind of shocked to find that Amazon does not support this phone if it gets a broken screen. This was very disappointing to me. While I certainly don't expect to get it fixed free, I'd like to think I can go to the "manufacturer" and get it serviced. I'm also a little shocked to find when I did a search for Fire Accessories, Cases it didn't show me all the options. I looked from before I bought this to try to find a good protective case and never saw any good choices in my Amazon search. I've found one now, after is dropped it once to often. I still love my phone, but these two issues bother me.<br/><br/>Where to begin? The phone is nice. I don't really have any issues with the touchscreen. I've read a few reviews saying it is not 100% responsive but I have had a couple iPhones and this phone is on par with them. I've used it for a couple weeks now and still am getting used to the the tilts and swings to make things work. They are cool gadgets, but I'm 50 and don't care either way about them. Once I get used to them I might feel I miss them on my company iPhone, we'll see. As many reviewers have stated, the battery life sucks if you don't turn off the dynamic perspective. I also felt the heat referred to with the Dynamic Perspective on, but not with it off. The battery life is great with it turned off.<br/><br/>It's a nice size screen, the camera is far superior to my iPhone 5's cameras. I took a picture of my puppy with both from the same spot, the difference is impressive. I knew that going in, but really can appreciate the difference when I compare the two pictures side by side.<br/><br/>I'm a Prime member who's membership had just run out, so it was a nice feature to get my Prime back for free. I love Prime, I enjoy the videos and the free shipping. Frankly, Amazon lost a couple purchases from me when I ran out of Prime, so that's a feature that pays off for them as well.<br/><br/>The earphones are very cool. I like the button on the volume control so I can activate voice dialing and answer or end calls. Haven't read any mention of that in other reviews. Similar to a blue tooth headset, only wired.<br/><br/>My biggest concern is the same many have. OK, not the loons who give the 1 star because of the energy source for Amazon's servers, but the Apps. It's a shame we can't get access to all the Apps that other Android users have. I understand Amazon's choice to force customers to use their App Store, but frankly I like the 7-11 App, the Hardee's App, my banking Apps, Busch Gardens and Kings Dominion's Apps. When I go back to Florida on vacation next year I'll want an App for Universal & Disney, which they don't seem to have. I could walk around any of those parks blindfolded, but still use the apps to check show times, and ride wait times.<br/><br/>If they'd get the Apps straight this would be five stars.
So far this phone is an excellent device. It is a significant upgrade from my Samsung Galaxy S3. The operating system on the phone is very easy to use, and since it mirrors Kindle tablets it is fairly easy to find everything.  On the galaxy there were features that I never was able to use because they were so difficult to find. The Fire phone has plenty of features that jump out of you, including Firefly, an easy to use camera, and commands that appear by shaking or twisting the phone.<br/><br/>The dynamic cameraS and changing perspective effects on the screen are unbelievable. I have never seen something like this before, and it is really something interesting to see. Video clarity on the phone is outstanding.<br/><br/>This is a well-built phone, it feels solid in hand. My AT&T; service is significantly better than the Verizon service that I previously had. Coverage seems to be more robust, and I am not dropping calls in my home anymore.<br/><br/>Obviously, the ease of integration with the Amazon store is a huge selling point if you are a Prime customer.<br/><br/>Some problematic areas: the carousel on the phone makes it difficult to find recently used apps and other items. Sometimes you have to scroll quite a bit to find things that you want to be able to find easily. I know there are shortcuts to find various apps and media, and I will use those overtime. In addition, I still wish the Amazon app store was more robust. However, I have sideloaded several of my favorite Google applications into the phone. Some of the hand gestures to activate features don't always work.  I don't know if its me or the phone, but I typically us the menus so it is more of an annoyance.  Finally, I'm not a big fan of the included earbuds. They are hard without a soft cover, and they don't fit my ear very well. I've read that others like them, but I can take them or leave them.<br/><br/>There is no such thing as a perfect cell phone, but this phone far exceeds my expectations. And, at the reduced price plus an additional year of Prime (which is a $99 value), it is a steal.  It feels solid, has great graphics, and the call sounds are clear, and AT&T; has been great so far in their service.
I've taken some time to write this review so that I could review with experience.  I bought the phone a little over a month ago on Amazon's website and was very happy with the easy buying experience including the process of signing up for new service with AT&T.;<br/><br/>*The phone's hardware seems very expensive; I don't think Amazon cut any corners in manufacturing the Fire Phone.  It is fast, has a nice screen and plenty of storage (32GB minus the space for OS and apps)<br/>*I switched from an Android and hoped that I would see all my favorite Android apps in the Amazon App Store.  Not the case.  There are a bunch of games, but I don't drain my phone's precious battery life playing games.<br/>*Battery life is terrible.  However, it's possible to decrease battery consumption by turning off dynamic perspective.  The phone charges very quickly, but I don't want to bring a charger with me to work every day.<br/>*Text messaging app freezes up sometimes and the keyboard disappears.  Requires a restart to fix.<br/>*Keyboard doesn't seem as intuitive (with respect to understanding me and my keystrokes) as my MotoX. The MotoX and iPhone seem to do a better job of correcting the mistakes I make while typing.<br/>*My phone has refused to startup once and had to be reset.<br/>*Email app is rather decent, but for a Gmail user the best is really just to use the Gmail app.  I hope Gmail's app will be available on Fire soon.<br/>*Amazon's apps work very well on this phone.  If you use Amazon Prime or shop Amazon often, this may be the phone for you.<br/><br/>Hopefully Amazon will get the software working a little better.  Knowing that the hardware is quite good, I am hopeful that software updates will be on the way now that Amazon is receiving user reports.<br/><br/>Maybe someday Amazon will offer a Kindle/Fire email service to complete the branding?
I switched to an Amazon Fire Phone from an iPhone.  I was an Apple fan for 8 years.  I still love them and use my iPod Touch.  I just needed a change, but I didn't like most androids.  This was a great in between.  With 32GB, I was excited about having much more music on there since I didn't need too many apps.  I do have a few beefs.<br/><br/>1. When I played music before putting my entire music folder on there, the battery was pretty average.  I can have it for a day or longer if I didn't really use it.  At most, it lasted a day and a half  The music app kills the phone now in a very short amount of time.  It lasts about half a day now.<br/><br/>2.  No Google.  At all.  You can download it through there non-amazon app, but it seems like it's such a process and I haven't had the time with life and work.  I've had the phone for 2 months and I still haven't done it.  Honestly, if it supported Google, it would be 5 stars and I would never leave.<br/><br/>3. Bing.<br/><br/>4. No Starbucks app.<br/><br/>I do LOVE the phone.<br/><br/>1. The camera is sick.  The ability to change anything about the picture, add memes, stickers, and texts without an outside app is beyond awesome.<br/><br/>2. I can only add pictures to texts and messages by putting it on the camera roll.  Life and work has kept me from figuring out how to go through all the picures, in their folders without it yet.<br/><br/>3. The cloud allows all of the pictures and videos to be accessed without taking up space... which is good if taking that space eats the battery as quickly as the music does.<br/><br/>4. Prime is amazing and addictive.  With an extra year added on to my account, I'm a happy girl.
Google Play: 1.3 million apps<br/><br/>App Store for Apple: 1.2 million apps<br/><br/>Amazon App Store: 250,000 apps plus Prime: 1+ million FREE songs, 40,000+ FREE movies and TV shows, 500,000 FREE books (borrow), FREE 2-Day shipping on 20+ million items and a FREE paid app every day (plus 1,000 free coins ($10 value) to spend on any paid app).<br/><br/> So, let me start out by saying, I upgraded from a Galaxy S3 and my work phone is an iPhone 4. Not the latest and greatest, so the Fire Phone is a definite improvement (spec wise), but that's not why I'm writing this review. I bought the phone on launch day. Yes, the $200 price tag was a bit steep (with a contract), but AT&T;'s plan was $20/month cheaper than my previous plan and I had a Galaxy S3, it was time for an upgrade. Reasons aside, I have really grown to love this phone. First off, I am an Amazon Prime customer. I was going to pay $100 to renew my Prime subscription in October anyway, so the "free" Prime extension was a definite incentive to test out a phone with no existing predecessor. So, after almost 2 weeks of owning the phone, these are my thoughts:<br/><br/>  First and foremost, the weaknesses. The phone had no Google apps. Did I care? Not really. I rarely used them on my Galaxy S3 phone. Besides, I can access everything Google by just signing on through a web browser. I just set it as a shortcut on my Silk browser and I rarely notice a difference. The Gmail app is the only exception because of the lack of filters on Amazon's email app. However, I do like the ability to see my most recent emails on the home screen without opening the app and it color codes each email so you can tell which account it was sent to (if you have multiple email accounts set up). Which is nice because I have work emails and non-gmail emails set up and they can all be conveniently accessed on the same app. So, I can still use Google maps, access my Gmail, update my Google+ account (but who cares, really?) and do everything else Googly related without having to download the app. I was able to even sync all my Google contacts and Facebook by simply adding those accounts to My Accounts settings on the phone. The only thing that actually took circumventing was my photos from my Galaxy S3 phone. Only about 5% of the photos got moved over (which I'm not entirely sure why) but a simple install of AT&T; transfer app took care of that once and for all.<br/><br/>  The last two glaring weaknesses of the phone are related; the battery life and the ability for the phone to all but melt due to overheating. First off, let me say the heat is noticeable, however, it isn't going to leave burn mark on your hands. The reason I'm not overly concerned is that, in any other electronic device that overheated, a noticeable performance lag was immediately followed. Think XBox 360 where the screen would freeze mid-game or it would shut down. Enough of these and it would inevitably be followed by the Red Ring of Death. The phone definitely heats up, but I noticed no such lag or performance degradation at all when this happened. Meaning, I had very little worry that the phone is going to just stop working (and even if it did, I'm well within my warranty window). What I can say is that, while most phones have a heat shield and plastic backings to protect the all so delicate hands of the user, the Fire Phone has gorilla glass which is a poor choice of dispersing heat and, instead, transfers it directly to the user's hand in a centralized location. How did I bypass this discomfort? I purchased an insulated case. Now I barely notice it at all. But that doesn't solve the other issue which is battery consumption. Despite the Fire Phone's decent sized 2400 mAh battery, using it with dynamic perspective turned on not only heats the phone up, but also shortens its use time. I found roughly 7-9 hours with moderate to heavy use. How do I get around that? Well, first off, the only things that currently use dynamic perspective heavily are mostly game apps. I don't play them for that long. If I do start playing a game and the phone starts getting hot, I exit the game. I don't normally kill 2+ hours on a mobile app game. For that I have my tablet and/or my PS4. I charge the phone at night and it usually lasts me a whole day. This is doing normal stuff like checking email, Facebook, making phone calls, sending text messages and playing a few rounds of candy crush or similar game. So, not a huge deal. When I want to play a game that uses the dynamic perspective feature (i.e. Republique, To-Fu Fury, Planet Puzzles, Amazing, Saber's Edge, Rubik's Cube...) I simply plug it in when the battery gets low.<br/>NOTE: I'd like to point out that the phone does not get as hot as it did the first day I got it. Maybe it needed to break in or maybe it was doing a lot of processing to set things up the first time.<br/><br/> Now the good stuff, without spouting technical aspects you've all undoubtedly heard/read already. Dynamic Perspective is anything but gimmicky. Let me start off critiquing a lot of reviewers starting out with they showed it to their friends and aside from an initial "aww" factor, their friends or coworkers weren't all that impressed. This should not even be a consideration. My friends don't use my phone. I use my phone, so as long as I find it entertaining/useful, then my opinion should be the only one that matters (exclusions, of course, apply to significant others). Friends and coworkers will never be excited for something they do not own. So their reaction will be cursory, at best, and should hold little weight over my opinion of a personal product like a smartphone. That being said, the best feature to exploit this is through games, for now, but it gives a certain level of "fun" to even navigating your phone. You can turn it off, but it has never bothered me or even made me nauseous, like some have claimed. It takes a minute to getting used to the gestures, but there is a definite "sweet spot" where you can minimize the gestures and simply tilt your head slightly to get the scrolling effect or certain other controls to work (like Peek). I keep it on all the time and some people complain that they can't view their battery power or connection status unless they are on the lock screen. This is not true, you can view it at any time (save for when launching an app) and I find the cleaner look without all the specs to give a "full screen" feel. If you turn off dynamic perspective, it looks just like every other phone (boring). Also, despite the fact the screen is only 720p, it is crisp and clear and looks leagues better than my Galaxy S3 or the iPhone 4S. In fact, the screen is gorgeous and comparable to any new phone on the market. So, no complaints there.<br/><br/>  The camera feature is neat. I have never had a phone respond so quickly to snapping pictures. Many times, my kids would do something and I wanted to take a pic only to miss out on the moment because I first had to wake up my phone, put in my pin on the lock screen, tap on the camera icon and wait for the app to load. Now, I just press the camera button and within 1-2 seconds, the camera launches ready for pics (even while in sleep mode). The camera is only 13 MP but it takes full 1080p video resolutions and it has an auto sensing feature that selects the best settings, on the fly, to take the best pictures. Definitely way better than my Galaxy S3 and cleaner than the iPhone 4S. Some critics compare it better than the Galaxy S5 and iPhone 5 but I have no basis for comparison.<br/><br/>  Firefly is a neat concept, though not entirely ground breaking. It recognizes songs and actors nearly flawlessly (when pointing it at a TV) and it even scans and recognizes bar-codes really well. The only thing it needs improvement on is scanning products. Most products that can stand alone are fine. But a lot cannot be identified without their packaging. Which makes sense. I can't point firefly at my living room TV and expect it to differentiate it from the thousands of other 50" TVs out on the market. But I can scan the box it came in and have it pull up the correct one on Amazon. Same goes for stuff like microwaves, toaster ovens, etc. The technology is new, it needs time to mature. I heard rumored that an update for Firefly will allow it to be used as a translator. That would be neat. I know Google is working on a similar feature. Would be exciting to see who breaks ground first.<br/><br/>  Everything else about the phone is on par with every other phone on the market. The text messages are simple, the phone calls are crisp and clear. (My only complaint in this department is the microphone placement on the phone is on the bottom. Which means that if I tilt the phone any number of degrees away from my mouth, it makes it significantly harder for the other party to hear me. I have to hold the phone nearly flush to my face for the mic sensitivity to pick up the sound.) The app store is great. Yes, Amazon only has 250,000 apps and Play store and iPhone store has 1 million+. Don't care. I cannot/would install a million apps on my phone. The necessities are there and whatever I need that isn't on Amazon, I can always find a substitute. The majors are there (minus Google) but again, I can always circumvent them if they are not (side-load?).<br/><br/>  Finally, the real reason to consider the Fire Phone. Content. The OS for the phone, in my opinion, is more stable than Android. Yes, flagship phones work great, but Android is designed to work on a multitude of phones with control being given to service providers where one phone can get a KitKat update while another has to wait months or perhaps never receive it all. The Fire OS is designed for one line of devices and it works well. Excluding the first generation of Kindle, I have never had any issues with any app I installed from the Amazon app store on a Kindle or Fire device. It's essentially the same level of expectancy from an Apple device as far as content is concerned. I can't count the amount of times I have uninstalled an app from the Play store on my Galaxy S3 because it stopped working or it froze on me. This made it where I never bought anything from the Play store for fear I would be wasting my money. I have no such fear from Amazon. But above all this, the Prime membership is the biggest selling point. Instant access to 10's of thousands of movies and shows, millions of songs, free 2-day shipping, free books in the kindle library and Amazon just keeps adding the perks. I love the fact that I don't have to download much of anything on the phone itself, leaving my 20+ gigs completely free for homemade videos and apps. Everything else is stored in the cloud and I can stream for basically free. If you had music saved on your old phone, you can transfer it wirelessly or via USB to the fire phone. But if you've ever purchased any digital media on Amazon, it is all accessible from the cloud plus millions more you never thought you'd like or knew about for you to consume at your leisure. Of course, you can do a good portion of this on a regular android device by just installing Amazon apps, but you can't get some of the exclusive features of the Fire OS like borrowing books from the Kindle library, downloading Prime movies and shows for offline viewing or play any of the Fire Phone exclusive apps which, though few, are extremely high quality and with Amazon's developer incentives, are rapidly growing. In closing, the Fire Phone has a few flaws, but they are not, by any means, what I consider a deal-breaker (save for the AT&T; exclusivity as some people may not have coverage or are locked under contract with their current provider). It may not be top of the line (spec wise) but where it lacks it makes up for it with solid performance, stability and state of the art features never before seen from any other phone on the market. Is it worth full price? Probably not for everybody, especially if you're not a Prime subscriber. But if you want the most out of your Prime membership, a solid device, exclusive access to new and up-and-coming features from your favorite online retailer, then it is perfect. I am a Prime subscriber ($99/year) and I have Netflix ($108/year). Netflix may have more programming available, but there's a lot of 3rd party independent programs out there (especially for kids) that I don't care for. Prime has all the stuff I grew up with and more added every day. I find myself using Netflix recently to only watch Netflix exclusive shows. But rather than paying $108 per season, it's much more economical to pay the $20 (on Amazon) to purchase the new season as it comes out. So, with the free prime membership and cancelling my Netflix service, I get a free phone with a cheaper plan and all the above mentioned Prime member benefits in the first year.<br/><br/>TIP: For those that say there's no back button, simply swipe from the bottom of the app window up and it will go back. Similar to Windows 8, swipe down from top feature.
It seems the Fire Phone has very little middle ground as far as those who love or hate it. Personally, I love my Fire Phone. I would stress if you are not a Kindle user or fan that you will probably get very frustrated with this phone.<br/><br/>There are many complaints by those that do like it where there are ways to relieve their headaches. Also, many of the complaints are not hardware related and therefore can be updated in software version releases. I love the seamless release updates after locked-up iOS release after release! Sync is a breeze compared to my iPhone or Galaxy experience!<br/><br/>The early reviews about lack of apps should really be disregarded. The apps everyone loves and lives by are coming fast and furious!<br/><br/>Also comments about the large icon homepage is not the only option. You can create folders and use as your homepage.<br/><br/>Prime ~ Amazon Prime is the gift that keeps on giving. I actually had a full Prime subscription prior to purchasing the phone and thought it was great but I thought even more of it with my phone.<br/><br/>I will say some must haves to save you a lot of frustration is ES File Explorer and Clean Master.<br/><br/>I will say I have yet to find a decent ringtone or wallpaper app but that could be my lack of really searching.<br/><br/>I have never run into problems with short battery life that some others mention.<br/><br/>Tell me what other phone has a Mayday service. I have used 3 times with all issues resolved within 3-5 minutes.<br/><br/>I do wish Otterbox would get in the game!<br/><br/>I have to say, to date, Fire Phone had been my favorite!
I researched it quite a bit since I was not in a hurry. I am coming from an iPhone 4. I am not a heavy user, mostly texting, calls, email, web, some apps, not a lot of games.<br/><br/>I bought an unlocked, new Fire phone on eBay for $125 (included 1 year of Prime, so essentially $25) after they disappeared on amazon. I got it connected to my cell provider (Ting) and played around with it a bit. I did not like the OS within minutes I could tell it was clunky with strange navigation. From my research I knew most likely I was going to want to add Google Play Store and load a launcher (an app which mimics a regular Android interface). It took about 3 hours and I had the phone loaded with Google Play Store, Chrome Browser and the Vire launcher, plus all the corresponding apps I used on my iPhone.<br/><br/>It works great! None of it was difficult, just following step by step instructions; loading a couple apps, downloading and installing a few files in the correct order. So essentially I now have an upper-mid hardware Android for $25!<br/><br/>Here are a couple warnings, though:<br/><br/>I have found 2 Playstore apps (out of about 20 I loaded) which did not work well on the Fire Phone. I was able to find replacements that worked just as well, though.<br/><br/>If you need a glass screen protector make sure it has a hole for the proximity sensor! If it doesn't it will make phone calls challenging because the screen will not stay on!<br/><br/>Swiping Up from the bottom to go back is weird and takes some getting used to.<br/><br/>Besides those issues the phone has been great. It is fast and easy to use.
My new Amazon Fire Phone is so much better than my old Android! My books and music were uploaded with lightning speed! Tilting left or right to bring menus and tilting up or down to scroll is very convenient. No fingers required. The sound quality is wonderful. The camera is great. Functionality is incredible. I'm having so much fun!
I was a hard core iphone user. Both my husband and I also love Amazon and both have Kindle's in addition to my I-Pad. When It was time for our upgrade, my husband was first and surprised me when he came home with a Fire phone instead of the iphone 6 that he had intended to get. At first I thought that he was crazy, but he told me that he loved it and I found myself playing with his more than mine. After a month, wneh I was also ready for my upgrade, I picked the Fire Phone as well. I can honestly say that while apple is and always will be in a league of their own, the Amazon Fire Phone is an amazing alternative, for those who want to stay with the android format and want to try something different. The Firefly techology is amazing and in a league of its own, everything that Amazon promised it to be and then some. The camera and apps are excellent and superior as well. The amount of free music downloads and free movies and videos that I get through my Prime membership completely blows Apple out of the water. For these reasons I am very happy with my choice and love my fire phone to death. While I admit that one of the few downsides is the artificial intelligence. While the fire phone has a decent voice activated assistant, it can not hold a candle to Suri. But that aside, this is truly a wonderful chance for those desireing something different, its like having your Kindle with all of its content and perks, in a phone form. Even the salesman at ATT said, both he and I wish people would be more open minded and give the Firephone a chance.
I got the phone locally, and I have to say it is nice but not perfect.  I disabled dynamics right away however<br/><br/>The lack of a star is from a few things,<br/><br/>1. Notifications go to carousel, keeping up with things like kik are hard when notifications go nowhere and do NOT show up on the lockscreen, its not like normal android were apps that are logged show idle in status bar with "x new messages, etc" you get notif once....or never again from what Ive experienced and i get notifs WHILE i am already IN the app talking to the person.<br/><br/>2. Customization, you could use a image 10x the res of this phone for the lockscreen and it will never look crisp it gets super compressed for no good reason. Also, no wallpaper, no way to nuke carousel, seriously? this is a phone...yet... yeah forget personalization.<br/><br/>Lack of apps can be fixed with something like apps.evozi and play.google.com to get legit up-to-date apps and aptoide helps with keeping things sorta up to date. The amazon appstore is a joke, its half of what is truly on there and forget trying to use custom launchers, you will have a black background and no widgets.<br/><br/>So really its like an android based iOS if you want to look at it.<br/><br/>For now, 99 cents for what it is? Sure. Once amazon updates it adds more features and fixes it or theres finally custom roms (which its barren on xda) avoid this phone if you want the 360 degrees of freedom android gives you.
My first smart phone and it is quite easy to use for a 70+ senio
Firstly: The "back button" is simply a swipe up from the bottom of the screen. Ingenious!<br/>Secondly: You CAN get non-Amazon apps on your Fire phone! It's a process called Sideloading, which sounds very intimidating, but trust me, if my old, technologically inept butt can do, so can you! You need an app like Dropbox on your phone and computer. YouTube and CNet both have videos showing you how easy it is. Be warned, tho.... you cannot sideload Google apps that require the use of Google Play.<br/>Love love LOVE my new Fire phone! I had gone from iPhone 3 to 4 to 5 and when their latest technology devolved to 1990s era fingerprint security, I bolted to the Galaxy Note 3. After a year of that, which was pleasant to start with, I longed for the good old iOS days, but was unwilling to go back. Enter Amazon Fire. The OS that runs the Fire is Amazon's special proprietary version of the Android OS, which I believe is even better. The screen resolution is gorgeous. Absolutely beautiful! I kind of miss the hugeness of the screen of my Note 3, but I do not miss the hugeness of the Note 3 phablet! It's nice to have a phone I can carry in my pocket, unlike the phablet. And the Fire is much more responsive!<br/>I'll update my review in a few months, but a week in, I'm loving it! And an extra year of Prime added to my account is just more icing!
This is not a in depth technical review as some other reviewers might write, but mostly a layman's impression of the Fire Phone.  In short, this is basically a miniaturized Kindle with phone functions.  For those who are familiar with the Kindle and enjoy using it, but don't want to carry a Kindle and a phone at the same time, then the Fire Phone is for you.<br/><br/>This phone is definitely geared towards people who use and shop Amazon regularly, or will try and lure non-Amazon people into it.  It is not as robust or customizable as other phones as it is missing the Google Play Store.  All the apps you can install are only what is on the Amazon app store, which is quite limited in selections.  However it has the majority of apps that most people will need for entertainment.  The main attraction about the Fire Phone is the Amazon related apps like music, reading, video, shopping, and Firefly function.  Those who have used the Kindle will be very familiar with those apps and how it works.  The Firefly function admittedly is quite fun to play around with, just point the camera at some object and it will identify what the product is and a link to purchase the item on Amazon.  It is fairly accurate, but what was most impressive to me was that it also recognizes songs and TV shows/movies.  I have not completely tried the song recognition, but it does recognize most of the songs I've played, so long as the song is available on Amazon's music store.  For the obscure songs that Amazon doesn't have on it's music store, it doesn't recognize it.<br/><br/>The camera takes decent pictures and is comparable to what all the other phones offer.  Let's face it, if you really care so much about picture quality, you'll probably have a real camera to take quality pictures with, but for those spur of the moments where you want to take a picture for memories, it will suffice nicely.<br/><br/>The dynamic perspective is neat and interesting, but it's not something you really want to pay attention to other than when you first receive the phone.  The dynamic perspective is also very battery intensive, casually using the phone to browse the internet and emails for a few hours and the battery is almost completely drained.  Most likely after you've tried this gimmick, you'll want to disable it so you get more life out of your battery.<br/><br/>The design of the phone is very basic and simple, not too much to comment on it, but the weight feels fine, size fits comfortable in my hand, and texture is decent and provides a nice firm grip.<br/><br/>I personally don't have any need to obsessively stare and use the phone as other people might to treat it as a mini computer.  The main function for me is the phone functions and being able to check my emails.  Amazon's email app is not as efficient as the iPhone's email, it doesn't sync all the email messages I've read on Outlook, like the iPhone would.  So every time I check my email, it just downloads all the emails and shows it as unread, which makes it incredibly inconvenient to know which email I need to look at for work.  Another minor gripe I have is that it is not terribly obvious which emails, texts, or phone calls are unread or missed.  The letters are bolded, but the bold is very minute and not as easy to detect at first glance.  The last issue I have, although I can see why the Fire phone would be like this for privacy issues, but whenever you receive a text, you will only see a notification that you receive a text, but you won't know who or what the text is.  Unlike the iPhone, when you receive a text, it will display the text even if the phone is locked, so when you're on the go and receive a text, it is more convenient to bust out the phone and take a quick peek to see whether it's something you should respond to quickly.  With the Fire Phone, it makes it extremely inconvenient to have to unlock the phone each time you receive a text just to see what it is.<br/><br/>The Mayday function, in concept is very nice.  Have not had to use it as everything is quite easy to figure out and maneuver with that I don't need technical help with it.<br/><br/>The most redeeming feature of the Fire Phone for me is probably the inclusion of one year of Amazon Prime for free, for those who do a lot of shopping on Amazon, this is really nice.
I love this phone  I made the mistake of buying a Windows phone and it drove me crazy. Apps r a work in progress but otherwise I love it. Maybe because I'm not a google maps user. Easy set up and easy to use except for scrolling with a flick of ur wrist.
When I got my Kindle Fire HD I loved it so much...it made everything that I do convenient and portable! I always wished my Kindle Fire could make phone calls...Amazon made my wish come true! I now have the best of both world's! I actually prefer it over the other smart phones that I have had. This is truly a quality Amazon product that is satisfying my organizational, scheduling, recreational and researching needs. Thanks Amazon for making my wish come true! But, I'm still keeping my Kindle.
Love my new fire phone. It's a large improvement from my Nokia 920. Don't understand how anyone can use Google anything, their the NSA's best friend.
I have had a fire phone for about a month and a half. I actually got three, to use as a family plan. Initially, I was frustrated by one phone's activity showing up on the other two. But once those settings and things was cleared up I have been happy with the phones. My daughter dropped hers in a big puddle of water and it didn't hurt the phone at all. Sure Amazon need more apps and some other fine tuning but Amazon just started this in July. Give them time.
I personally really like the phone. I think it's solidly built with a good camera and video. Comparing this with my HTC One (M8), which is rated to have one of the best cameras out there, I think it is very close in quality. Yes, there are a few apps that I wish it had that I can't get from Amazon. I think the battery life is good. I am a very heavy user and it lasts me from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. and still has about 20 to 25% left. On some days where I don't use it as much, it has about 45% left. I probably would not have purchased it for the original price. However, a 64GB phone for $99 for me was a great deal and I am very happy with my purchase.
Exceeded my expectations I am now starting to wonder why I bought the Kindle HDX, oh wait I got it with the phone.  However, I just recently bought a 7"HDX, so now have two.  I guess I need to consider giving one or both away for Christmas.  But really, this phone is like having a phone and a Kindle all in one.  Actually, I don't even take my Kindle with me most of the time.  I now listen to my audio books on my Amazon Fire Phone and even read my books when eating out.  The only time I do take the Kindle now is when I want to work on my novel when I am out.  I added a blue tooth keyboard.  But I guess I could 'pair' the keyboard to my phone and use the Office Suite App on the phone.  This phone exceeded my expectations - it is a really a "communications Swiss Army Knife"!<br/>Best quality of sound that I have had on any other cell phone.  At 70 years old, my hearing is not as it used to be but with this phone, I can hear clearly with or without the great Amazon ear phones. Love it, love it, love it!
I like the looks of the phone. It has a slinder feel, an not over sizes screen. Weight is much favored over other smart phones. Lots of nice apps, more than I would ever use. Weather, GPS, Firefly, Audio Books, etc are my favorites. Note pad is easy to use an get to, while needing to carry a list. I am not much for carry around music but its here an the ear buds are not bad either. Reading is a nice joy with a screen that does not fade away as my last phone did in strong light. Over all I dont dislike the phone other than the one day useage on the battery. If this phone held a charge for more that a day I would have given it 10 stars. Once you get use to the battery its not all that big of a problem. One thing that helps is to turn off WiFi when just reading at home. But then again its a phone primarily. But I rarely use it as a phone, mostly text an email. The battery goes all day but if you dont mind a charge time every day then there is mo problem. Great phone all in all.
I have had my fire phone for about 7 months now.  I LOVE IT!!  I have 2 kindles and anything I put on them goes right to the phone and vice versa.  I really like this feature as I use my kindles a lot.  I also like the free year of Prime.  I have read some negative reviews and their problems have never applied to me.  I use one of my pictures for background, so I never paid any attention to their backgrounds.  The battery seems to last a lot longer than my son's I phone, and it recharges faster than any other phone I have ever owned.  There are some apps you can't get and I hope Amazon is working to correct that, although they are not necessary apps for me.  I have shopped with it, read books, go on face book, etc., with no problem.  The camera is great.  Firefly works fine, but I don't really use it.  The only real problem I can live with is the small keyboard.  The keys could be a little larger.  Other than that it's a great device!!  Did I say, I LOVE THIS PHONE!!!
I've had my Fire phone for about a week now. The first couple of days, I had serious growing pains and was doubting my decision to change. But, giving myself some time to adjust (from iPhones), this phone is good! Like anything new, there are a learning curves. But that's nothing to overcome.<br/><br/>Email: You can use the mail application that comes with the Fire Phone to download your email from any internet based service (Yahoo, Hotmail, Gmail, etc). I did that on my iPhone and now in the Fire phone. I have full access to all my folders that I created in my Gmail account and was able to seamlessly sync my email. The mail program on the Fire phone works just like any other POP mail program (iMail, Outlook, etc). The transition has been good.<br/><br/>Calendar: It syncs all your calendars from your email accounts. I use Gmail and the Gmail calendar, so all of my appointments and events pulled up perfectly. I had no issues with that.<br/><br/>Photos: Syncing my photos to the Amazon Cloud was a little time consuming, but I was syncing A LOT of photos. I was able to create different photo albums in the Cloud, so now when I look on my phone at my Cloud photos, I can select what album to look in (Vacation, Kids, Pets, etc).<br/><br/>Music: I again, synced my music to the Amazon Cloud. It took forever, but that could be the 1300 songs and my internet speed. I have access to stream it to my phone now. I haven't really spent much time in the Music app to see about creating different playlists, but I can review that later once I spend time in it.<br/><br/>Usage: The battery life is quick. I have a Kindle Fire HDX, so I left my phone charger at the office and use my Kindle charger at home. I do stream music throughout the day and use my phone to access Facebook, so I have the need to charge my phone. But, iPhone battery life was about the same, so I charged it throughout the day as well.<br/><br/>Dynamic Perspective: I think it's cool. I really like the 3D interaction. I haven't played any games on my phone yet with it, so other than using it for the lock screen and just phone interaction, I can't properly give you a review on it. But from other posts, people like it to game with. I do like the flick of the wrist motions to pull up side menus in different applications. That's also the Dynamic Perspective working for you, and watching your head movements. Sometimes, when I can't find what I'm looking for, I remember I can flick my wrist and pull up what I was wanting. Again, just takes some time to get used to and to remember to use it!<br/><br/>Camera: The camera takes fantastic photos. It's easy to use, and you can access quickly from the side button on the phone, even when your phone is locked. If you hold that button, the Firefly app comes up and you can scan a song, phone number, product, etc and Firefly will pull the information up. I do quite a bit of shopping with Amazon, so the comparison shopping with it was fun.<br/><br/>The volume control buttons are right above the camera button. I LOVE that I can adjust my volume on my phone WITHOUT unlocking my phone. That was a BIG pet peeve of mine with my iPhone.<br/><br/>I called Mayday on my phone and got a quick response. The tech was very helpful in answering my question regarding the phone. I brought up that I couldn't delete my recent call list (like I could with my iPhone). I could lonely delete it one phone call at a time. The tech told me they would submit my request and it would be reviewed. If other users called in with the same issue, they would put that feature in a new software release. I like that idea, and again, since the phone is new, we've go to let Amazon know what we want in the phone. Another issue I brought up was making a phone call from my VIP list. It was a few more steps than necessary, and the tech told me that they were fixing that in a new software release already. My third problem was syncing photos with the Facebook app. Again, they looked into it, and will address that issue with the App department and see about getting photos to sync a little easier from the Cloud to the application.<br/><br/>I like that I can call in and give them some feedback on my likes and dislikes and it would be addressed. The overall change over from my iPhone to the Fire Phone has been good! Like I said in the beginning, there are some growing pains, but like any good company, Amazon is listening and taking everything we want in a phone to heart. I love that this phone seems to me like a hybrid of an iPhone and an Android phone. I'll take the hiccups along the way to create a really fantastic phone! I can't wait for more software updates to really get the user experience I'm wanting. So far, so good!
Since I'm all things Amazon Prime already, this was a no brainer for me.  It  was completely familiar to me from the start.  Intuitive as all get out.  Firefly technology blows me away.
I'm very pleased with the performance of my new Fire Phone. It functions similar to any other smart phone but appears to be much less frustrating (sensitive). Others that claim it is a battery hog must not realize it has a quick switch to shut down unused apps that run in the background. There are plenty of apps to choose from. I use mine primarily for a travel and communication (GPS,Weather, Phone,Texting, etc.) device (i don't play games) but they are available. Integrates with FB, Camera is outstanding and saves automatically to cloud where you can retrieve your shots with your PC. Another great plus is, you can read your Kindle selections (when bored in waiting rooms) and listen to Prime Music while traveling when pairing with your car sound system. Voice commands function well too. A little pricey but, have not found anything to dislike about it yet.
Gravely disappointed. I received my phone (pre-order) on Thursday and returned it Friday morning.<br/><br/>KILLER ISSUE: failures in data transfer; sync; and basic interoperability with Outlook<br/><br/>1. CANNOT TRANSFER CONTACTS DATA FROM IPHONE<br/>At least, I cannot transfer ALL of the data. My presumption was that the first thing Amazon would get right would be making sure we can preserve basics like phone and email contact information when we get a new phone. However, while the AT&T; Mobile transfer app does transfer names, numbers and addresses is DOES NOT transfer 'notes' data for contacts.<br/><br/>This is for me a deal breaking failure. I have some 2K business contacts in m phone and use the Notes field to remind myself who is who and where I met them. After long discussions with Amazon tech support (excellent if ultimately ineffective) and AT&T; it became clear that the only way to get that data onto the Fire was to manually retype Notes for all 2K contacts. That is such a stupidly basic thing to get wrong. Blame Amazon or blame AT&T; for writing bad transfer software as you wish, the end result is that you simply cannot get all of your contact data onto the Fire phone.<br/><br/>2. PHONE DOES NOT LINK/SYNC TO LAPTOP OR PC<br/>Amazon lets you sync files to Amazon Cloud, but it does not back the phone up to my laptop. Synching to the Amazon Cloud is fine as far as it goes, but it means I have no means to transfer Outlook files, contacts, email or SMS messages, etc., to the Fire phone. As with #1 above, the ability to interact with business standard software like Microsoft Outlook was something I wrongly presumed would be a given. iTunes has had that functionality almost since day one, and it is strange that Amazon would effectively take a step backwards.<br/><br/>3. APPS. WHY USE ANDROID IF ITS NOT ANDROID?<br/>I had not realized just how few apps are available on Amazon. For example, there is no app for the NYTimes (arguably the leading US newspaper); there is no app that allows me to connect with my Garmin GPS (again, the industry leader)... I had read about the decision to use their own hodgepodge-variant of Android and block access to Google Play but had not realized how fully frustrating it would be.<br/><br/>SUMMARY:<br/>The phone is beautifully built, and what it does it does very, very well. However, the phone and software are designed as a stand-alone system. Fire's failure is that it does not interact well with any of Microsoft, Apple, or Android applications.<br/><br/>The result is an arrogant Amazon's-way-or-no-way-at-all approach. Admittedly, Apple does much the same, but I can forgive them much because their software works and interacts with other system, including MS Outlook.<br/><br/>I might have forgiven Amazon the headaches with the Apps if the phone had simply allowed me to transfer my full contact data but it did not. I have instead returned the Fire phone in grave disappointment and reverted to a original, near-vintage iPhone 3. I am now much happier.
Awesome. Fast. Pictures come out so clear. Speakers are loud enough to fill a large room with sound. Video quality is awesome on the large screen. I can't put this phone down
I absolutely love this new smartphone.  It's everything I wanted in a smart phone and much, much more.  We recently upgraded to the new Amazon Fire smartphone and I'm so glad we did.  It's like having a mini-computer with you all the time.  We even use it around the house since the WiFi​ feature connects to the house WiFi and there is no data usage.  I never thought I would use a phone in this capacity because I have always been a firm believer in the desktop computer.  We even have a laptop, so I didn't think there would be a need for another computer type device.  I was wrong.  We're actually using the Amazon Fire throughout the day for weather checks, email, games, Facebook, and a myriad of other features.  The free prime (2 years for 2 phones) and the streaming music through prime music are other bonuses
I originally had a Galaxy 3 and I was looking to upgrade. Decided to try the Fire and I was not happy at all! I will admit, the Firefly app was pretty cool but that is all that this phone has going for it. This is what smartphones were like in their infancy. There are a ton of apps that are not available (basic apps in my opinion), phone doesn't feel sturdy at all, the back is made of glass and there is no way of personalizing your phone with wallpapers, fonts or colors. This phone is "basic" to say the least. I lasted less than 48 hours with the Fire and took it back to the AT&T; store. I couldn't get rid of it fast enough! Another thing is that it is WAY over priced. I decided to go with the Galaxy s5 (which is $100 LESS than the Fire) and I couldn't be happier!<br/><br/>Pros-<br/>Firefly<br/>Free Amazon Prime<br/><br/>Cons-<br/>No personalizations at all<br/>Lack of apps<br/>Very Expensive<br/>Mediocre camera<br/>Back is made of glass<br/>Feature on the phone are very basic
Got this device yesterday and after only a day of use, I can say I'm absolutely happy with my purchase. My favorite things?<br/><br/>- I find the most helpful feature of the phone to be the side panel access, and the gestures to access them. So easy to navigate.<br/>- The Firefly feature will come in incredibly handy when I'm out doing my shopping. It's gonna save me money.<br/>- Love my year of free Prime! <3<br/>- Mayday was nice to have when I couldn't find my Prime Music. They fixed my problem within 2 minutes.<br/>- The Dynamic Perspective feature is pretty freakin' neat. The games that incorporate this are super fun & suck you into their world. I cannot wait to see more developers make use of this.<br/>- I'm already a AT&T; customer, so upgrading was free. I love free things, haha. :)<br/><br/>The only thing I've found so far that I'm not happy with is the method to call someone within my Contacts. I'm used to just swiping left or right on a contact to either text or call them - it was very convenient. On the Fire phone, I have to tap on the contact name, then select "call". One more step than what I'm used to, but so far, it's the only pain point.. and it's a small one.<br/><br/>Though I do wish there were more decorative cases for the phone, I'm sure that will change pretty quickly.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm very happy with my new phone. Thanks, Amazon!  :)
I've been quite satisfied with the Fire phone. I have found its operation to be intuitive and reliable.<br/>I know there have been a number of negative reviews of the product. These seem to have centered around comparisons with the latest Apple or Samsung and the fact that the Fire phone is obviously designed to function within the Amazon eco-system.<br/>I haven't owned an i-phone so cannot make a comparison. Each of the operating systems provided by various companies seems to direct users towards a particular commercial environment so I don't really understand his complaint.<br/>If one is a satisfied Amazon customer looking for a well designed, easy to use smart phone I think the Fire phone should work well.
I love this phone!!!!  There have been a few minor glitches, but there isn't another phone out there that I'd rather have!  I love being able to search on Amazon while shopping in a store, just to make sure I'm getting a great deal.  I'm guessing that the minor glitches I've had were due to me not knowing how to work the phone.  The best thing about the Fire phone is Firefly/Mayday app.  I used it the day I got it, got a great person who helped me do what I wanted to do which was add music (from my Amazon cloud player) to my phone as my ringtone (I've since added several more songs from my Amazon cloud music collection).  Did I mention that I love this phone?
I know some may see that I am giving this phone 5 stars and immediately ignore this as I know the fire phone has come under a barrage of bad reviews and publicity. I waited until recently to pick up this phone, first because my upgrade from AT&T; wasnt available yet, and secondly because I hadnt quite decided if I wanted to buy it yet. I have now had the phone for a little while, and I have to say that overall, I love this phone.<br/><br/>Before this, I was almost strictly with iPhone's, but I have been a strong Amazon supporter since the begining. I was already aware of the application limitations that many complain about, but I point out that the kindle IOS (on the fire as well) runs off of a modified Andriod IOS. This means that while you do lose the google support, you can actually sideload the apps you really want that arent available on the Amazon appstore, and you still retain the Amazon assistance, which is quite substantial in itself.<br/><br/>The battery life of the phone isnt that great, but the fire phone comes with several capabilities, including the ability to actually determine what specifically is draining your battery life. Dynamic perspective is awesome to use, but if you arent needing it you can shut it off and that by itself helps conserve battery life. Plus, lets face it people, unless you modify your phone or buy an extended battery/case, most smart phones require an additional charge each day regardless of who made it, plus this phone lasts as long as its competetor's models with it being a 1st generation.<br/><br/>For those that complain about the music factor, again you can import music from itunes, or any other music program, plus if you have Amazon prime, you have access to Amazon Music, which is as cheap as it is on itunes, plus some of its free with Prime. You cant beat free.<br/><br/>Firefly is the first of its kind identifying software, capable of identifying songs, shows, and almost anything, with also taking away having to manually type things in for better ease of service. With upgrades to that particular software down the road, who knows what the capabilities are? I look forward to the development of that particular piece of software.<br/><br/>I know I already touched on the draining power of dynamic perspective, but the actual capabilities of the software are impressive and neat. It unclutters the screen in some cases, and games designed with dynamic perspective add a new element that make it overall more fun to play with.<br/><br/>While the initial cost of the fire phone wasnt that great, the current cost of the phone isnt bad, and when you factor in you can now buy it unlocked AND that it still comes with a year's subscription to Amazon Prime, you really cant beat it.<br/><br/>There is bad things about this phone. I wont deny that, but you will find problems with *any* brand of phone out there. No one brand is tailored to meet everyone's needs. For those that are heavy Amazon consumer's though, this phone is perfect. Yes, I have issues here and there with the phone, but not any that either I cant figure out how to overcome (battery life and availability of apps) or that I probably wouldnt have found in another phone anyway. I love my Fire Phone, and look forward to the Generation 2 model.
I had been an IPhone user and apple product fan for quite some time. I have been an avid Amazon Prime user as well and made the switch to the Amazon Kindle tablet a couple of years back and am now on my second. When my contract was ending for my Iphone I started to take note of the Fire Phone, and did research, talked to people and seriously considered making the switch for quite some time. I always tried to be open minded and realized that many of the folks that are IPhone fanatics are doing so to be "trendy" and part of the "in" crowd. I was never one to just folow blindly, and was puzzled when those that I asked about the Fire Phone who put it down or said not to try it, could never give me any solid reasons except that they thought that Apple was the best. I went to the ATT store to trade in my I Phone 5 and was going to get an I Phone 6, just to be safe. Fortunately for me, I had a long wait and spent a lot of time handling the display Fire Phone and really loved it. When I looked at the I-6 , while it is a great phone, aside from the bigger screen did not see much difference. I asked the ATT sales person, what he thought of my possibly jumping ship, expecting him to say "dont do it", but he pulled out a Fire Phone and told me "I love mine". That was good enough for me and I made the switch and after a month I can honestly say that it was one of the best decisions that I had ever made. The Fire Phone is everything that Amazon promised and more. The Firefly technology is amazing, and had never had the feared 'freeziig' issues that people warned me of. Sure, Apple is a great product, but sometimes it pays to be open minded and not blindly follow like sheep. If you love the features of the Kindle Fire, you will love the Fire Phone as it does many functions that your tablet can do and more. After thoroughly using all of the features, the only room for improvement that I even remotely see is the artificial intelligence. The artifical intelligence is Siri and Cortana are much more interactive, but you can talk to the FirePhone and it will do most of the commonly needed hands free functions. I never used Siri on a regualr basis, so this is really not much of an issue for me. If you are considering making the jump, take a chance, I love mine and you will be glad that you did. As a small afternote, my wife had been one of the many IPhone fanatics, but after seeing and playing with mine for the past few weeks, she completely surprised me and traded in her I Phone for a Fire Phone as well, so now we are a 2 Firephone family, LOL.
I am an Apple iPhone convert. I've been off contract for about a month and wanted to see what new features the new iPhone 6 had to offer. I can't say I was too pleased. I had been eyeing the Fire since it came out and as I looked for a new phone and heavily considered much of its competition, the Fire always stuck in the back of my mind.<br/><br/>Finally decided to take the leap, and just a few days in, I am totally happy. I realize a few days will not be enough, but just playing with it and figuring it out, I've seen that it is way different from the iPhone, which is exactly what I wanted, but it doesn't compromise on ease of use (which the iPhone does best WITHOUT a doubt). Like iPhone, the Fire is very nice to maneuver, especially when multitasking. I never liked the feel of other Android phones. They looked too messy. The Fire is clean. It doesn't have all those messy widgets that you see on HTCs or Galaxy phones. They remind me of having 18 windows open on my desktop. Ugh.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Ease of use<br/>-Maneuverability<br/>-Clean look, no messy widgets<br/>-Great camera (I don't require much, just nice clean, crisp pictures: this phone will give you that, just not so much when you zoom in at full capacity. Then it gets a little foggy)<br/>-The highlights of the phone are great (Firefly, Dynamic Perspective). Very handy and work as shown.<br/>-Tilt the phone up or down to scroll pages. Love this feature. I read. A LOT.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-You only have access to the Amazon App Store, which doesn't include some vitals like Bank of America App, Kaiser Permanente App, etc. Apple did spoil me in that sense.<br/>-Battery life not as good as iPhone. HOWEVER, it's not as bad as some of the reviewers on here say! Of course a phone is going to drain battery if you're on it all the time, streaming and gaming and stuff.<br/>-The phone can get pretty hot. No joke.<br/><br/>Still worth it. I love my Fire.
The phone has some great features such as the dynamic perspective which is very impressive but so far very few applications take advantage of it.  Firefly is one of my favorite applications, it's very good at identifying music and will identify most other objects.  After Firefly identifies something it's easy to buy the item from Amazon.  The Amazon Kindle application works well, of course.  In general, the phone works well with supported applications.<br/><br/>If you like Amazon services then this is the phone for you.  If you rely on any of the Google services then this is not the phone for you.  Gmail is supported very well but Google Wallet isn't supported nor is Google Drive.  It would be very nice if Amazon would loosen up the restrictions on Google based programs.<br/><br/>Unfortunately Amazon Wallet isn't terribly useful at this point.  It doesn't take advantage of the phone's NFC chip to allow tap-and-pay at the newer registers.  Hopefully Amazon Wallet will become more feature rich as time goes by.<br/><br/>I've sideloaded a few applications  which weren't in the Amazon Applications Store with mixed results.  Most work (including Google Chrome) but some don't (like my bank's application).  Sideloading is really easy to do and the instructions are readily available on the Internet.<br/><br/>The phone is now a bargain at 99 cents.  I paid considerably more at the AT&T; store.  Very disappointing!<br/><br/>Bottom line for me is that I came from a Samsung Galaxy S4 and for the first few days I missed the S4.  I've come to prefer the external button layout of the Fire Phone.  I always had a problem with pressing the volume buttons on the other side of the phone when pressing the OFF button on the S4.  I now prefer the Fire Phone because it supports Gmail even better than the Galaxy S4 and because the Fire Phone's method for accessing program options is more logical than other Android phones.  For example when in Contacts, the VIP contact list is accessible by flicking the phone slightly from the right (or dragging from the right) and the Contact options are available on the left.  It's possible to operate the phone with one hand which is a real advantage after you learn how. The phone has a learning curve and after putting in some time with the phone I appreciate the phone's design more and more all the time.<br/><br/>The battery life of the Fire Phone is much better than the Samsung S4.  I usually have over 50% of a charge left at bed time.  I have blue tooth, wi-fi, GPS, and NFC turned on all of the time.<br/><br/>The face and eye detection sensors are much better on the Fire Phone than on the S4.  The Fire Phone scrolls text very smoothly which makes reading easier.  The screen resolution of the Fire Phone is also better than the S4.<br/><br/>The camera on the Fire Phone as many features that the Samsung S4 doesn't have and again it takes time to learn all of them. The camera has several features which I appreciate such optical stabilization, automatic HDR mode, a very sophisticated panorama capture feature, and full resolution burst capture.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to seeing what the future brings for this phone.  It's an enjoyable phone to use and I'm betting that Amazon builds on it's very solid foundation.
UPDATE: I have had a change of luck. They finally replaced the phone with a new one and I have had no issues with it so far. I guess the first batch might have had issues. I can only speculate. Now that this one is fully functional, I re-rated it back up to a 4. Ill change it to a five in a month if no issues arise.<br/><br/>I have trained myself to always have a power cord handy, but noticed that if I am jumping from wifi spot to the next, or using FB messenger a lot it is what drains it consistently. I have a case this time too haha.<br/><br/>---------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Well I wanted to like this thing but alas it was not meant to be.<br/><br/>I usually do not complain or even bother getting upset over things, but this phone is basically a brick. I have been in constant contact with support since it came out late July with no reassurance that it will be fixed. Ive been on chats, numerous phone calls, and the occasional email back and forth, still nothing. It is September 9th as of this review.<br/><br/>My OS crashes constantly to the point where I have to reset the phone ~3x daily. Once it crashed for 3-4 minutes all while making this high pitched sound and it wouldn't power down. Awkward at work... The technicians asked me to do a full reset wiping out most of my apps, and then re-installing them sent me over my data limit. I hate money anyways :D<br/><br/>The keyboard locks up, requiring a reset. It disappears entirely or just freezes. Always at work at the worst possible time. I am a super at a job site, my phone is critical.<br/><br/>The icons lock up and the screen freezes constantly. If I was on my phone typing this, well, I never would gotten this far.<br/><br/>My camera is fuzzy because dust is collecting behind/inside my lens.<br/><br/>Battery life is pretty bad, unless you dont use the phone. On standby it lasts a long time, but if you text or FB messenger it will suck the life out of it.<br/><br/>When the thing works I love it, but for the other 85% of the day I hate it.<br/><br/>I was literally about to return it when I broke it out of frustration. I guess it was meant to be.
As a iPhone 5 owner I was craving a larger phone. I got this in spite of some of the poor reviews because as an IT specialist I know sometimes it's not always what it seems and was willing to try it out.  I'll try not to compare to much but will still use my iPhone experiences as a base. Lengthy but here I go.<br/><br/>For me the pros are;<br/>-Well obviously a large crisp screen. Slippery bugger so you will need a case.<br/>-The screen protector I got through Amazon doesn't affect the Dynamic Perspective at all, like I saw others said.<br/>-The 13 megapixel camera is amazing. I compared (though it's not fair true) to my iPhone 5 camera shots and well; I tossed out using my 5. 'Noisy/Grainy' photo quality, as said in Amazon's description, is so true. This quality is like looking at a magazine.<br/>-Speaking of magazine picture quality, if you do use the Kindle book app or the included Newsstand app for magazines as I do you will love the quality of what you see. Clear, crisp and simply beautiful. I have an iPad Air but sometimes I  just want to whip out my phone instead of my iPad without sacrificing quality or clarity.<br/>- Video content playback is fairly quick to buffer. I have Verizon FIOS so whether I connect to my FIOS app to watch TV or connect to Netflix. No matter what Wifi I connect to. Again the quality, speed and sound is great.<br/>- Customizing the phone is a learning curve for an adamant iPhone user but once you learn it without comparing, it's easier.<br/>-Firefly and Dynamic Perspective are cool, nice niche but not exactly life changing.<br/>- I also put on AVG virus protection for me, a no brainer.<br/><br/>Disappointments;<br/> - Battery life is not too great not at all the listed time they claim I timed my from full charge 12am to 12pm with minimal regular use no pictures or videos. I HAD to charge it. But compared to my iPhone I won't call it horrible.<br/> - App availability isn't the best. However, once I found the app to help install other Android apps that weren't in the list I was much happier.  There are still a quite few fairly regularly used apps like banking, youTube, shopping ->(Macy's for ex. LOL) that don't work on the Fire and I can live with that for now. Hopefully as they do updates that will change.<br/>- Some missing features that are very helpful on any phone;<br/>making abbreviated shortcut for words or phrase. Fire's version is a Dictionary you add to; but that's a little cumbersome, you have to enter in the first few letters to get to what you added in the dictionary but it also shows you words it thinks you mean so you have to scroll to what you do me (just well type it sometimes).<br/> I only have full use of one hand so while having a dedicated button to take a picture is handy it be nicer if you could change in settings what the button does. In my case to choose for it to mute immediately would be nice. It takes a couple of steps as is.<br/>- Some way to manage your contacts better (i.e.make groups). I guess that would be more of a great app, that I haven't found for the Fire.<br/>- The Browser leaves a lot to be desired. I get they wanted their own but if you have an account with Google or Firefox that holds your current shortcuts(quite a lot for me). They need to let something else in like other OS phones.<br/>- Can not customize Calendar. I was able to import my Apple iCloud calendars and notes so the import brought in the different calendars created through my iPhone. I still can't use the Fire calendar to create anymore custom calendars. Though if I add to the Fire Calendar it updates in my iPhone iCloud.<br/>- Lastly, telling your phone what operation to do. Many phones have the capability to do so much more than just send a text or email. In my case again with limited mobility. Giving voice commands would be a great help.<br/><br/>Overall I like the phone so I give it 4 stars cause I expect they will update the operating system to clean up some things like any other phone, but I haven't quite jumped iPhone ship yet. Maybe after September. We will see.
I received my Fire last Saturday....now...I should probably say that I have upgraded from a Blackberry Q10.....Being a BB nut for probably the last 10 years, you can probably understand how huge of a leap this was for me.  I experienced most of the issues that people have been complaining about and for the most part, those issues have worked themselves out in the 10 days or so that I have owned the phone.....with the exception of the microphone issue.  EVERYONE has a hard time hearing me if I don’t press the phone almost to my mouth, but I’m sure that is a firmware issue that can be fixed with adjustments to the noise canceling and microphone gain settings.  I happen to think people are exaggerating a bit when they complain about the warmth of the device.  It does get warm, but it is certainly not hot, and with the amazon shell in place I don’t feel it at all.  The OS is smooth, responsive and easy to learn.  This was a huge concern for me because I thought the BB OS was the best I’d ever used, not to mention the OS on the Kindle fire that I own (which the Fire OS is based off of) is the worst OS I’ve ever encountered.  I had serious concerns about being able to accurately text on the device, but the on screen keyboard is accurate and allows for fluid text and email composition.  The dynamic perspective feature is a novelty at this point, but cool to look at and show my friends.  So why the 2 stars?  My device has an issue with shadows and dark colors.  Any app……. Or anything for that matter that is shown on the screen that is dark or has shadows forces the device to display tiny red vibrating dots in the shadows or dark area.  It happens even when attempting to take pictures…and in the photos that I receive.  I’ve attached an image of my music player and if you look at the album images you can see the red dots.  Imagine that on every app, image or screen display.  Honestly the fact that something in the screen is defective is no big deal….my issue is that I called about the problem the day I got the phone and still haven’t been approved for a replacement device.  There is apparently an issue with approval for replacing defective Fire phones.  Considering Amazon prides itself on customer satisfaction and it’s (under normal circumstances) excellent and simple returns policy, this issue shocks me and disappoints me to the core.  I had to inform the last person that I talked to that if I don’t get notification of a replacement device being shipped by Friday,  I will return the device and go a different direction.
I like the phone and especially the fact it didn't come preloaded with a bunch of apps. I switched from a Galaxy 4 which i really liked but the Galaxy had 16 gb on it and by the time AT & T was done with loading their apps there was only 7 gb for me to use. I added a 64 gb micro sd card but then found out I could only store photos there and apps I purchased. I could not move any apps that were pre-installed. I paid all that money for a phone and it still was not mine to configure the way i wanted. The fire phone has some nice features and comes with 70% of the 27 gb available for you to use the way you see fit. The Firefly and Mayday work as advertised and are excellent features. Camera takes great pictures and video streaming is excellent and picture is crisp and sharp. I reserved one star because of the limited selection of apps and the fact you can't access your Google play account. I'm sure when Amazon gets more people writing apps for the Fire I will be willing to give it a fifth star.
I have had a variety of phones over the years, and just recently left my iphone for the fire.  I love this phone.  It is super user friendly and just plain old fun to play with.  I usually need reading glasses to see my phone, but with the dynamic perspective of the fire I don't need them.  It works great with my vehicles audio system for talking and receiving texts, plays music on demand, and is driver friendly as to not distract the driver while driving. I am a horrible picture taker, but now all the pictures I have taken have come out great.  I like the battery life, in that I charge it at night while I sleep and use it all day at work to make phone calls and hot spot for my tablet, and I still have enough battery to play music on the drive home and while cooking dinner.  i don't miss google and firefly is pretty useful where I might have missed google.  It is a change from the norm, and I don't like change too often, but fire made it fun and easy.
It user friendly. I have access to everything that is on my kindle fire. Firefly app is wonderful and easy to use.
I've had the Fire Phone for about two weeks now and just got the latest 3.5.1 update.  With that latest update, I can now say I love the Fire phone.  I've had an iPhone for the last 6 years and was getting pretty bored with iOS.  The Dynamic Perspective really intrigued me and I actually really like it.  There's a little learning curve, but if you follow the tutorial that comes with the phone, you can learn it pretty easily.<br/><br/>The FireFly feature is most useful to identify music for me.  I know Shazam does the same thing, but being able to hit a button and click the music icon on the screen is very useful to me.<br/><br/>I've been able to load most of the apps I use on a daily basis with no problems.  You can side load a bunch of other apps not available on the Amazon store.  There are a few that I miss, but I haven't found that to be a problem.<br/><br/>There are some free games that utilize the Dynamic Perspective that are very fun to play - much more than games available on iOS.<br/><br/>The best part of the phone is the integration with Prime - I've switched all of my iTunes music over to Amazon Music and have bought a few albums from my phone.  The sound from the included headphones is amazing.  I've watched some movie and ready some books - all synced to my Kindle Fire HDX and the movies with my Fire TV.<br/><br/>Research the phone and know what you are buying.  I was already a Prime member and on ATT.  It was a great purchase for me and I would highly recommend it.
I LOVE the fire phone.I v had it for 4days now and it makes all other phones seem boring.Ive read other reviews and don't see how people say it gets hot it gets alittle warm when charging but that's it.The screen is crystal clear and I don't strain my eyes reading it.When talking on it I have no problem hearing.The camera takes great picture.Love the carousel feature.The dynamic perspective is really fun.The apps are great.I found all the apps that I used on my old phone.The phone is definitely worth the money.Thanks Amazon for a great phone
Phone is very fast. A lot of the apps available on other platforms are not available through the Amazon app store, which is the main drawback. Otherwise, of the apps that are on there, I haven't had problems with any crashing or having glitches. The battery life is very good. Even with streaming music through Amazon Prime, the phone lasted a while workday. The tilting of the screen for some features takes a bit of getting use to, but can be helpful, especially when trying to do stuff one handed. Overall very happy with my Fire Phone.
A great little phone. It gives a different Android experience. It has solid construction and is a joy to use. Physically, the phone is somewhat reminiscent of the iPhone 4. I find the design very appealing.I also like that the home screen is laid out in the same manner as the Fire tablets. Call quality is great. The 13 megapixel camera is excellent.The Amazon app store does the trick for me . In my opinion, Google Play is not needed. The phone also comes with a nice suite of built-in apps. I am very happy with my purchase.
Had the phone since the first day. It works great - no problems with connecting, calling, etc. Speakers are clear, battery life is decent. If you like Amazon's environment, then you know the apps available. All apps previously bought/downloaded work on the Fire phone. Hope they continue to update.
Fire phone runs much faster and smoother than the galaxy s3 that I replaced. Has all of the apps that I used through google play, and since launch they have already added several features through software updates. Add in the new price on contract with a year of Prime and i think its a great value
The Fire Phone just didn't work for me.  I had an iPhone 4s that was having some issues.  I wasn't eligible for an upgrade but trusted Amazon and wanted the Fire phone.  Obviously, it took me a while to make the adjustments from the iPhone.  After one long week, I returned the Fire phone.<br/><br/>I am a working mom that needs a good phone that won't slow me down.  The phone part of the Fire was just ok.  I loved all the other features but calls & messaging really were awful.  I sounded muffled when I made calls, had trouble answering incoming calls while busy (missed buttons) and the messaging was not as easy to manage. I don't usually get tech items first day, but thought the Fire would be so cool and work well for me. In the end, it just frustrated me.  I couldn't get used to it and decided that given the price, it was not worth it.<br/><br/>After returning, I tried an Android phone afterwards (LG G3) and have to say that it is so much better for me.  I wasn't married to the Apple brand and needed a phone that had some nice features while helping with my multitasking.  I may try later generation Fire phone if some of the main complaints are fixed.  If you don't make a lot of calls/messages, then you may love the phone for all of the other extras. Otherwise, I would recommend another brand.
Fantastic phone, unbelievable in its scope and utility. I would give it 10 stars if I could.
Brilliant phone. Great key features that will only get even better as more software programs take advantage of them. Wonderful future potential. Perfect camera, wonderfully clear pictures. Forget the recent 1 star non-reviews, they're all just crazy eco-nuts failing to see the irony of their own posts. Buy the phone, you won't be disappointed (unless you're an Apple fruitcake or Google eyed goon).
For the money I paid I would like things to work... The calendar does not have the options that I am used to..... some of the notifications does not notify me like I have it set up..... Then I had to download an app just to set ringtones for text messages for certain contacts.... and some of the tones that I downloaded does not work as I save them for contacts......... I have had my fire for about week and 3 days…. Maybe I need to give it more time, but all in all I like the phone
I am familiar with many different smart phones including the iphone's, Droids, Nexus and Galaxy devices. This phone is a great new entrant with some great features from what is becoming a very very good hardware company. Amazon has been making hardware for just a few years compared to Apple, LG, Motorola, Samsung, LG, Etc but there products are very solid, this one included. There are some things that could, and probably will be improved in later revisions of this product.<br/><br/>The price of this phone is a little expensive for an Android phone, but the base model does include a year of prime and 32GB of storage, which is double what a new iphone, galaxy or nexus phone comes with.<br/><br/>The weight and size of this phone are a little bit on the heavy side, but this phone feels very solid and neither are a deal breaker. The phone doesn't have the premium metal feel like a iphone 5s/or an HTC one, but once your case is on they all feel the same.<br/><br/>The screen is very good, the resolution and color are excellent. The 4.7 size in my opinion is just right. The 3D feature is really neat, but I am not sure that it will be that cool or helpful in the long run. Stay tuned for updates to this review in regards to the 3D feature set. I presume 3D will become a better feature once more apps are developed specifically for this phone.<br/><br/>The camera is very good and has been a joy to use. I am excited to use this with some of the different photo apps on the Amazon AppStore. I think I even prefer it to the iPhone camera.<br/><br/>The sound on this phone is very good, the speakers are excellent and front facing, it is a nice change from other smart phones. The included headphones seem to be built well and have flat cable which is an added bonus.<br/><br/>The battery life is good to average for a comparable phone. Longer than the iPhone 5S for sure, the battery is 35% larger than an iPhone battery.<br/><br/>The new Fire OS for phone is nice and snappy to use. The OS is ok, like the original tablet OS it will be continually updated and shortly become a very polished product. One negative regarding the Fire OS is that the Google Play store isn't included for apps, everything must go thru the Amazon AppStore. The Amazon Appstore is great, and the free App a day is a great discovery tool, but it is nice to have the breadth of the Google Play catalog.<br/><br/>Overall this isn't the greatest smartphone ever released, but it is definitely a great first smartphone for Amazon. Especially for users who are heavy users of all Amazon's offerings(Prime, Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, Etc.)It is great that Amazon didn't just make "another smartphone" with like specs but made revolutionary steps like dynamic perspective. If Dynamic Perspective is improved over the years then you will see other phone makers imitating this feature.
Let me first say that I really like the phone so far. There are a couple things that I don't like, but they are not deal breakers, and can probably be fixed later with updates. (My old phone is a Motorola Atrix 4G)<br/><br/> I will start with the Cons first:<br/>1) I already miss the finger print scanner from my Atrix. The Lock screen, for the Fire, is simple with little options.<br/>2) There is a large section of ringtones, and notification sounds, but nothing that I really like. I was able to make songs(full songs) in my library ringtones on my old phone. ***UPDATE*** If you plugin your phone to the computer you can copy and paste full MP3 songs into the ringtone folder & use those songs as ringtones.<br/>3) The phone is very slender, and when I try sliding the carousel on the phone(from right to left) I almost always end up sliding out the right hidden panel, which displays the weather for my area.<br/>4) I still have to get certain apps from 1mobile market to get the apps I like.(only 2)<br/>5) The battery life seems poor. Unlike it stated on the website. I doubt it will even last a day on a full charge. I will update this later after I have used it for a full day.(I had a full charge @ 10:30am. It is now 2:45pm and I'm @ 78%. I have not used it much at all, no games, no movies, no books. Just registered it today. Flipped through the setting, Made one call, and a couple of text.<br/><br/> The Pros are:<br/>1) The inverted 3D(dynamic perspective). Is visually stunning, and doesn't make me dizzy or nauseous while looking at it.<br/>2) The peek, to show battery life, time, and wifi bars, Is ingenious. Just slightly tilt the phone to see these items show up at the top of the phone. then they disappear when you tilt it back. NICE!<br/>3) When displaying the list of texts, from previous individuals, It shows a +2, or +3, etc. on texts that were sent to a group of people. Very smart. I like this.<br/>4) To go back to the previous page, just slide up from the bottom of the phone. I didn't know this at first and was screaming at myself "How do I go back...Where's the back button? Stooped Pho...Ohh that's how"<br/>5)The phone works as a phone and fits in the hand nice, although it is a little slim for my fat hands.<br/>6) I like the swipe keyboard. It should be standard for all phones.<br/>7) The firefly button/app is a great addition to this phone. I can now get rid of the 3 apps I was using to do the same thing.<br/><br/>All in all this is a really good phone. It has some great features and seems to work really good so far. I will update this review when I have had more time with it. By the way it is now 3:18pm and I'm @ 76% battery, without using the phone.<br/><br/>***UPDATE***<br/><br/>At 1:37pm The battery died while watching a movie. So the battery did last for a 24+ hour period on 1 charge, with minimal use except for the movie. I also got an alert at 15% & 5% battery life to plug in the phone. The phone did get warm while watching the movie, but not hot.<br/>The picture on this phone is amazing. Very clear and crisp. Let me also add that my old phone is still at an 85% charge with only little use.(transfers, and checking status)<br/><br/>***2nd UPDATE***<br/><br/> I Drained the battery on my phone, and did a full charge again. HOLY COW!!! I think it worked. Today at 4:40pm (July 26)I unplugged my phone, and was at 100%. It is now 1:35am(July 27) and I am at 93%. Grant it I haven't used my phone that much, being at work and all. But That is 100% better than yesterday. If you are having trouble with your battery. Try draining the battery by watching a movie, or something. Then give it a full charge (while its turned off). I think it took about 2.5 hours I didn't keep track. But this is more like it. I hope this helps. If it works for you pass it on.<br/><br/>***3rd UPDATE***7-31-2014<br/><br/> I am very pleased with this phone. I have been using this phone like I would use any other phone. The call quality has been great. I tend to play music on this for about 6 hours at a time(during work). I don't watch movie/shows on my phone, and very rarely play games on it, and the battery is still lasting 24+ hours at a time. The phone has some really good features, like showing extras under the apps in the carousel, especially for E-mail and texts. This also navigates very easily I haven't had problems finding anything that I need, and anything that I need takes very minimal steps to get to. The camera, and firefly are pretty sweet. The camera takes great photos, and Firefly has been recognizing most of the music, T.V. shows, and products that I have tested it with. I would say it works about 98% of the time.<br/> One post that I did read mentioned that most people tend to hit the home button when they're done looking at or doing whatever they're doing on their phone. This can leave programs, or apps running in the background while you use your phone. Draining the battery even quicker. The best thing to do is swipe back after you're finished with whatever you're doing. This will close out the program, or app.<br/><br/> I have been reading both negative and positive feedback on the phone. Make sure that the feedback you read is from a verified purchaser. I read one that said "I don't own this phone, but I do have an opinion of it"(and it was, of course, a negative review) LOL!!! how stupid. Some People just make me laugh sometimes. Anyway... I haven't had any problems, or major glitches with this phone, and this will probably be the last update, unless something major comes up. Just remember that the phone does have a 1yr manufacturers warranty on it incase something does go wrong with it. Thanks to everyone who has responded, and Those who have purchased this phone I hope you enjoy it.<br/><br/>Just one last thing. I would like to see Amazon integrate the phone features into their next tablet...That would be sweet, and maybe a bigger tablet, and wider phone the next time around.
I really hated this phone when I first used it but then I googled how to add Google play store to the Amazon Fire phone and now I love this phone. Having access to all apps is a must for any phone and it was really easy with a little research.<br/>Thanks Amazon I am looking forward to your next phone.<br/><br/>P.S. I took this phone to T-Mobile and the employees where impressed with the Dynamic perspective..and the price compared to what they had in stock.
Now perhaps my review is premature, but I think I love this phone...always had iphones, and loved them...but as i tinker with this and had my more tech savvy family members help me with it, this phone is Awesome! Also...not to shabby, you get a year of prime included, and yes I know we pay for everything, but this phone is so worth it.  I am looking forward to learning the ropes, and its really a beautiful screen, and the color and resolution is wonderful. Ill post again when i have had it for more than 24 hours...hope you all will post helpful hints lol.<br/>also...not dissing the iphone...still in love the iphone...but....the fire has a very user friendly software.
I have had this lovely phone for well over a week now,  and I do say I love it very much. I don't care about the cons it has, I was just happy to switch from Verizon onto a phone that I saw a steal. Once I saw the commercial for Amazon's first smartphone I wanted it right away, just to give them a chance. I mean it's their first phone. I mostly purchase books from Amazon, nothing else. However, one day I decided that it was time for a new phone and I was not going to pay another loathsome bill for my LG Lucid. The Amazon Fire Phone has all of my favorite apps ( e.g Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, Pandora, Skype,etc) and I just can't put it down. Some of the apps like Wattpad I wish it did have, maybe with another update this phone will be able to support it. At first due to the bad reviews and the phone itself not selling, I became suspicious. Then I thought who cares. I don't care what anyone has to say about this phone because I'm sticking with it. I love the 3D perspective and the Prime that comes with it, plus I can backup all of my lovely books on this device. Plus it has this cute little Monkey Buddy that is addictive. I recommend it.
I love this phone! I really do, the only complaint i have is not really a complaint about the actual phone. I miss my emojis. Ridiculous, I know but it's true. Other than that I am obsessed with it. the clairty of the screen and ease of use has all my friends feeling jealous. The graphics blow everyone away and are a huge hit with the gamers in my life. The Fire Phone was an answered prayer i didnt realize I had.
I don't know what all the crap is with these other reviews but I've had this phone for a few days and I keep waiting for something to fail me or disappointment--or something. Yeah, no deal. The phone is easy to use, downloads all the apps I normally use, and generally works awesome.<br/><br/>Some of the reviews complained about the battery. It does charge slowly when hooked up to anything besides the actual amazon plug, but when it does get all charged up, the thing lasts as long as any other smartphone. Longer than my old Samsung S3 and my iPhone.<br/><br/>Some complaints also came in about not being able to adjust or change music when the phone is locked, like many phones do. This one does too. It might have been from the newest update I just downloaded, but it works great. And with all the audible books I listen to and the prime music that I am now discovering is totally awesome, I have definitely tested it thoroughly.<br/><br/>I don't see the problem. I've never been able to adjust to a phone so quickly and easily. What can I say: it's awesome.
This is a good phone. Very Android like. This is clearly the first model of the phone, with some bugs to work out but all first generation models have that regardless of manufacturer. My biggest complaint is the lack of google apps and a general lack of apps - such as Starbucks, Hulu Plus, Redfin - to name a few. I look forward to the app store expanding and the kinks being worked out.
I bought this phone for my wife. She loves it, it has taken a bit of getting used to and not being able to use certain apps is a bit of a bother. Although the size is great, the Dynamic View is AMAZING. How great is it that when she has a problem, push the question mark and Mayday helper shows up on the phone and walks her through to a positive end, with a happy smiling face.
I switched from an IPhone to the fire and I love it.  The text size is wonderful for my eyes.  The mayday help button gets you help quickly and the tech support is fantastic.  It has a voice feature similar to IPhone.  You can ask it to search, text And to make calls for you.  I listen to music in my car and the sound is so much richer on the fire.  I use an adapter and the quality of the music is really good.  I could not get that from the IPhone.  Picture quality is really good.  I absolutely love the alarm sounds that wake me in the morning.  Very pleasant.  Love tapping the screen to see music lyrics.  It reminds me of karaoke.  The words that are sung are highlighted.<br/><br/>Fire flu is awesome.  I don't need shazam to fine out who is signing on the radio.  It will tell me about product and movies.<br/><br/>Last but not least, I love my prime, where I can view movies and television shows. Video quality is good.<br/>I am very happy with the purchase.
Without getting into detail this is simply the best phone I've ever had. The one-handed operation is incredible. The Amazon ecosystem is vastly superior to Apple's ( at a small fraction of the cost). All my Kindle Fire apps, books, music and videos are all now on my phone as well. Is there a learning curve, absolutely, but the time invested is well worth it.
I bought this phone recently at a great price on Ebay.  For the last 8 years or so I have used iPhones exclusively.  I didn't need a new phone, but the price was so good I thought I would give it a try.  I figured if I didn't like it I could keep the free year of Prime it comes with and sell the phone to make a few bucks.  After just a few days of learning the interface, I have to admit... I really love this phone.  The tilt to scroll down, the wrist flip to use sub-menus, the instant camera button, all work great.  The 3D display is both cool, and functional when using apps like the map, quickly glancing at the time, etc.  I am an Amazon-heavy consumer so the phone fits my needs very well.  I order items at least once a week, listen to Audible daily, and have a ton of Kindle books and magazines. The built-in Amazon friendly apps are great for me.<br/><br/>I'm so happy with the phone I plan to keep it and use it exclusively--I really expected to jump right back to my iPhone.  As some have said the App Store could use some overhauling, but I really think Amazon has done a great job trying to catch up the market.  The phone comes with nearly every app I use regularly... and honestly, I suspect most folks aged 30+ would be pretty satisfied with the choices of apps available in the Apps Store.  I added a scanner app, some social media apps, and now it has everything I need.  Since they didn't sell well on Amazon the phone can be picked up at rock bottom prices right now.  The battery life is comparable to iPhone... especially after the most recent update is downloaded.  The only thing that is keeping it from 5 stars is the limited choices of apps.  Not sure why this phone got bashed so hard by so many... I am an Apple fanboy (many computers, iPhones, and Ipads in my home), but now I use the Fire Phone daily and I couldn't be much happier with it.
I don't normally write reviews but I feel like people need to know about this phone. Having been a former iphone and android user I wasn't sure that this phone would be able to meet my requirements. After fulfilling my contract with my service provider I was able to get my monthly payment way down. In order to keep the low price I was unable to upgrade through them without sacrificing my low payment. When this became available for the almost comically low price of $130 INCLUDING a year of prime, I decided that even if it was garbage, it had to be better than my two year old Galaxy with a broken camera and screen.<br/>First things first: This phone is amazing. Anyone trying to avoiding signing their life away to a perpetual iphone payment plan needs to know about this phone. The design is great and it is perfect for single handed use. The screen is vibrant and crisp and the operating system is smooth and responsive. And let's not forget THAT CAMERA. My goodness. Photograph ALL THE THINGS! Absolutely the best camera I have had on a phone as of yet. Dynamic perspective is great but possibly too ahead of its time as it has very little functionality given the current uses. Basically, once you get past the "OOOhhh, pretty." There's really no other use for it. Turn it off. Save the battery life. Also, in regards to battery life. This thing is a marathon runner compared to my Samsung Galaxy. I've been taking, editing and posting photos all day, irresponsibly shopping on Amazon, and checking emails all day without connecting to a charger and I'm still sitting pretty at 9pm at 65%.<br/>I do see where they went wrong. Most of this has to do with the phone's initial price point. If this phone and the new iphone are the exact same price, everyone will go iphone. Everytime. It's what we know. It's hip. It's cutting edge and it's guaranteed to work. No one wants to spend the same amount of money and get locked into a contract on a gamble. Well with this GSM unlocked phone there's no gamble. No contract. And no price tag equivalent to one month's rent in a roomy one bedroom on the better side of town. This phone wins. And I commend Amazon on continuing to provide updates even after sales tanked. This is why I trust Amazon. With all of that being said, after using this phone I would love to become an Amazon convert if they ever decide to take a stab at the Fire Phone 2. This phone far exceeds what's currently on the market for a much better price.
I love it!  I am surprised with so many negative reviews.  I guess they were the early postings (early-adopters get stung often, cie la vie).  Seems the bugs are working their way out.  Many of the complaints you see listed here are non-issues for me.<br/><br/>I've had the phone for 40+ days and it is working great, no glitches, no trouble.  It meets and exceeds my requirements.  I am a Kindle reader, an audiophile, and love shopping Amazon.  This phone makes the shopping/using connections easy and fun for me.  Immersion reading on the phone (audio with the book that highlights the text being read as it goes along) is a totally wonderful experience and with the phone I can take that capability with me everywhere.  I am "reading" two or three books per week (600-1000 pages) and amazingly I am retaining way more of it than I was before.<br/><br/>If you like having 10-gazillion apps in the store to do what-the-heck-ever 10-gazillion apps can do this is not your phone.  If you are a purveyor of the Amazon eco-market get this phone and your experience will be extended/enhanced.  The spatial recognition features on the phone are powerful and add much to the experience.<br/><br/>Pros:  Powerful tool for aiding navigation through the Amazon economic ocean.<br/>Fast processing<br/>Love the headphones--no tangles, great audio, great functionality<br/>Reliable<br/>Good signal<br/>Speaker works well<br/>Great support<br/>Intuitive functionality and menu-layout<br/>App store that provides needs and does not overwhelm the user<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Battery cannot keep up with all the power needs of this uber-gadget (I recharge daily which has not been so on other phones)<br/>Brain-washed iPhone users think you are from Mars when they see you with this (but maybe that's a pro?)<br/><br/>I recommend it and am highly satisfied.  I hope the line continues.<br/><br/>Cheers!
I love this phone! I am so happy I went for it. I have a Kindle HD tablet that I love and I needed a new phone. I read all the reviews and I quickly realized that the bad reviews were never a problem with the phone. Actually, the phone was often said to be great, even by angry users. The apps were the problem. Iphone users were angry at the Fire phone for not allowing them to use all their usual apps. It is a little like switching from a Mac to a PC. Your expectations should be that you will have to make some changes and adapt to new apps. The apps on the Fire phone are sensational! The calendar, contacts, email app are even better than the Iphone's and all you need to do is enter your email address(es) and password(s)  and you're done. I use gmail, hotmail and yahoo. The many fun features are incredible like the lock screen I can never get tired of, or the different menus that appear on the left or the right when you move your phone. All the "usual" social apps work really well also. There are tons of apps available so if you are ready to adapt to new apps that may work even better than the ones you are used to now, you won't be disappointed.<br/>There were complaints about the lack of a "Back" menu button. The truth is that the first thing explained about this phone is that you just slide your finger up on the screen from the bottom up to about a quarter of the screen and it takes you back wherever you were before. It works great, I use it all the time. You also sometimes have the option on the side menus I mentioned earlier. And a bunch of apps do have an integrated back menu button.<br/>A great thing too is that you get Prime for a year. I am already a prime member and it added an extra year at the end of this year membership.<br/>PICTURES: The screen is gorgeous. The Fire phone takes nice pictures that are uploaded to your free Cloud Drive automatically.<br/>MUSIC: The sound really surprised me. I couldn't believe how great it sounded and the headphones are the best I ever had. They are magnetic, they really do not tangle! They fit super comfortably too - something that has been a real problem for me for years as I tried several earphones that worked for me without success. The lyrics can be found on the right menu if you wish to sing along your songs as well as info about the song/Artist. I personally listen mostly to Prime music for free now.<br/>BOOKS: The screen is so beautiful, I actually enjoy reading on this phone but what's even better is that on the right menu you get all the info about the book you're reading, authors, reviews, recommendations, ...<br/>MOVIES: Works great with Amazon Prime, Hulu, Netflix, HBO, Xfinity, ... You name it!<br/><br/>Conclusion: I simply love this phone. I think it is better than the Iphone but you have to be willing to change a few apps. Voila!
This phone is better then what I expected. After I read all the bad reviews, I didn't think it was gonna be good, but I gave it a shot. When you first get the phone, you have to fully charge it. Then do your settings etc, after you set it up to your Amazon account, you have a interactive tutorial of your phone that has audio, speaks to you, and shows you everything you need to know. After that I got all my games from my cloud since I had the same account on my kindle, then I took pictures, made my own home screens with a animation camera feature, so when I tilt it around I see my dog from different angles. The camera is excellent, it is high quality and gets every detail. The layout is very different and if you have had a kindle or other Amazon device you will be sorta familiar with the layout. When I hit the home button a few times, I can tell my phone what to do, including calls,text,email, and much more, but you can't talk to it like siri, but it's helpful. Even after the tutorial, you can still replay it from the "fire" icon/app. The back doesn't come off, and the arrow dynamics are better then they sound, you have to try it out. It has the same Amazon app store. What I love about Amazon devices is that the only way you can get a virus is if you actually tried to!! They protect there software ware well,but you can turn off the feature in settings. This phone isn't too big, isn't too small, but is just right. It has amazing quality speakers and the sound quality is amazing. The only minor complaint I can really even say about this phone it that you can't turn it on by hitting the home button, but that's no big deal at all. Firefly works really good. And it is cool. This phone is perfect for me, and I know it can be perfect for everyone else. Try it, I'm positive you will LOVE it. I love it. Last thing, the sound doesn't blur out, it has speakers on the top, and bottom.
Personally, I like my fire phone. I don't understand all the negativity to a point. Yes it does have flaws, but for the 200 I am more than pleased.  I had a flip phone and finally upgraded in November of 2014. During this time Amazon realized it's phone was bombing and dropped the unlocked price to 200 so I acted.  I was in the market for something unlocked and pulled the trigger.  My girlfriend has an iphone4 so that is my reference to smart phones.  I have att with 4g and find the browser to work just fine, it seems to find and load videos much faster than friends with older generation galaxies and my aforementioned girlfriends phone. Amazon is behind in apps, but for me I haven't wanted a certain app and not been able to find it.  I mostly use the mainstream apps so yeah take that for what it is worth. I also really love not having a flip phone so I could be biased.<br/><br/>I am not picky. So pay attention if you are. The phone seems to try make itself one hand usable, but it's screen is slightly too big to make this practical for some.  However it works for me.  At first you will be trying to figure out what said shortcuts are.  I did it through trial and error. Once I learned they felt very natural and worked for me.  The issue is they have so many one person never uses them all.  It is almost like you have 6 different options to perform any task which leads you to choosing you favorite. Variety is great, but often things will prompt or happen on the phone screen without intention. Plus you won't use and or discover different ways to use the phone months after using it. If you are easily bothered or picky you will hate this phone because of this. For an unlocked 200 dollar phone I am completely satisfied.  I am sure that I have forgot many thoughts.<br/><br/>Also I typed this review on my phone so noval writing is a possibility with the fire phone. If you have any questions I will try to answer as timely as I can @ techy0690@yahoo.com
I've had the Fire phone now for about 5 months. I like it a lot. Is it the best phone on the market? No.  I'll do a review on a few of the particulars.<br/><br/>MayDay- never used this... it's a live 24/7 service that is to help you with any questions. My guess is this is for the more elderly users who are unaware of smartphones.<br/><br/>FireFly- This is a really cool technology. I use it now when buying anything. I instantly receive information on whether I'm getting a good deal or not or whether I can buy it for cheaper on Amazon (Occasionally I get other companies but it always has Amazon of course) This feature has saved me quite a bit of money, and of course made Amazon quite a bit as well lol<br/><br/>Dynamic Perspective- Complete Gimmick. Its super fun on the home screen and with all the different home screens available, it doesn't get old. Many people often are amazed how it can follow your eyes and body movement so well.<br/><br/>However, in almost every other situation, it's an annoyance more than anything. If I'm reading and article and take my eyes off the phone, it scrolls (thinking I'm looking down or up I suppose) that doesn't' happen all the time, but when it does, it's annoying.<br/><br/>Apps - They do not have all the apps you're used to from Android and IOS devices, but they will have most/all of the main ones. The ones the Fire Phone didn't have, I was able to find replacements easy enough.<br/><br/>Amazon Prime - It came with a year of free Prime and this was my first experience with it, and I absolutely love it. I initially thought prime was JUST "2 day free shipping" but it's so much more, there is music books and my favorite are the prime videos. It's basically like a HULU or NETFLIX, but with the option to buy some of the newer stuff that isn't free. But don't' worry there is a ton of free content as well. I'm currently watching all the seasons of Survivor :) I'm going to definitely renew my prime, I've been in love with that feature. Of course you can get Prime without the Fire Phone, but as it came with a year of free prime, I thought I'd mention it.<br/><br/>Camera/Speed/Display/Storage - Camera is 13MP, it has a Quad-Core processor, and display is 4.7 inch with 315 ppi and a 32GB Storage, all for 99 cents, no complaints there.<br/><br/>Overall - Where the Fire Phone wins is in the Deal. For .99 Cents you get a modern 13MP Camera, Quad Core Processor, and 32 GB and one year of Amazon Prime (worth about $100) I'm a former IPhone Guy (Last was the IPhone 4S, didn't like the IPhone 5's or 6's) I've had Android Phones before but never really liked any of them. I finally picked up this phone just because the specs were all great and it was a great deal. I love my phone for what it is but it could improve, but you'll be hard-pressed to get a 32GB phone with that Camera and processor AND a year of Amazon Prime for less than $1.
I love my Fire Phone! I was a loyal iPhone user since the very first one came out and was completely fed up with their product and customer service.  I was ready for a change and I'm so happy that I switched to a Fire Phone.  I am an amazon prime user already so it made sense for me for music and movies, ect.  Everything is great on the phone the video, the camera, the firefly, the dynamic perspective, even the battery it's just an all around cool phone.  And the MayDay is why I bought the phone.  24/7 customer service for everything you need, I mean seriously! What is not to LOVE!!! No more going to Apple and them telling me it's a 2 day wait to make an appointment with the genius bar and then them just tell me it's a problem with my provider and your provider to tell you it's a problem with Apple and back and forth and back and forth.  MayDay walks you through the solution and helps you fix it or find a way around it.  I LOVE IT!!! Just push the button and they are there LIVE!!! AMAZING!!!!<br/><br/>#1. The apps are seriously lacking I mean really really bad, and you can't even use Android apps they are not compatible so you are even more limited.  Google play won't let you access anything from it unless it's compatible with your phone and let me tell you it's not.  I'm not a huge app user so I'm okay with it and hoping it will improve over time.  No Bank of America (seriously), no Runkeeper, no MapMyRun (and nothing even in the ball park on these), they don't even have Garmin connect so my watch isn't compatible.  Amazon is seriously behind in the health movement with this phone and this is something they really need to step up with considering how all the other phones are killing them in this market.  And I mean all other phones not just iPhone but every Samsung, HTC, every phone but this one.  It didn't have emoticons for a while when I first got it but there must of been an update because one day they just popped up on my phone.  So I'm sure they will get the apps eventually but they definitely need to step it up in the app department.<br/><br/>#2. The earbuds: they are comfortable, have great sound, cool styling, no problems there.  BUT you CAN NOT skip a song while your music is playing, you literally have to get the phone out and skip it on the phone.  This is a really stupid design error to me, I mean seriously a no brainer.  These earbuds are designed specifically for the Amazon Fire Phone everything works great but no skip song option.  HOWEVER, my husband has the new Samsung Note and it works effortlessly with his phone.  SERIOUSLY!!!! It's designed specifically for my Amazon Fire but I can't even skip a song and he can double click all he wants with MY HEADPHONES FOR MY PHONE which is doesn't work with at all.  Totally ticks me off.  I'm a triathlete, I spend too much of my time in the gym, running, cycling.  If you are busy with your hands to have to stop and get your phone just to skip a song takes too much time.  And I know it's a little thing and I was okay with it until I realized it works effortlessly for a phone that it isn't even designed for.  It's just a really really bad mess up by Amazon poor design error with either the phone or the compatibility of the headphones.  Whatever it is figure it out, ridiculous!!
This review is about the Fire Phone (2014 edition).<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- I love the design of this phone (nice black color and thin/sleek)<br/>- It's fast<br/>- It's connected to everything Amazon<br/>- Good app store<br/>- Good battery life<br/>- Only paid $0.99 (99 cents) for the phone itself with a new AT&T; contract<br/>- Phone activation was quick and easy<br/><br/>Extra Pros (outside of the phone itself)<br/>- Got a free year extension on my Amazon Prime membership<br/>- I like AT&T; more than my old provider (Sprint) -- better coverage and overall service<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Can't connect to the Google (Apps) Playstore (this is a HUGE con and I will talk about it more later)<br/>- Amazon's built in "Cloud Drive" doesn't allow one to easily upload files manually chosen files into their account from their phone<br/><br/>Step 1: Activating the Phone:<br/>I simply charged up the phone, waited until it was done charging, and then I turned it on to be activated.<br/>Activation was not as simple as it should have been because something was trying to use the Wi-fi connection as I was trying to activate it. Eventually, after turning if off and then back on a few times the activation went through. It wasn't much of a hassle, but could've been smoother.<br/><br/>Step 2: Manually Upgrading the Phone:<br/>This is IMPORTANT! Before doing anything, go to your settings and click "install system updates". Even if the phone updates, keep doing this until the phone says that there are no more updates. Why is this important? Because before I installed all the updates my phone was "hot" and had a few bugs. However, the updates fixed all of that. Additionally, 90% of the one and two star reviews of this phone are before Amazon fixed these initial issues. They're fixed now.<br/><br/>Explanation of the Google Playstore:<br/>The pros of this phone (listed above) are self-explanatory, so I won't talk about them in more detail. The cons, however, need to be.<br/><br/>First, I "hate" the fact that I can't connect to Google's Playstore and install Apps from there.<br/>Now I'm not "tied" down to Google, but I miss having more of a selection. I mean a regular Android phone can use both the Playstore and Amazon's app store. I have heard some say that it's Amazon's fault and I have also heard some say that it's Google's fault -- that they block Amazon phones.<br/>No matter whose fault it is, I find this con to be a HUGE hassle, and it is the only reason that this phone didn't get five stars.<br/>A "solution" to this is to "Sideload" apps by enabling the phone to install Apps from "unknown sources" and manually downloading or transferring the app to your phone. Additionally, some apps are available on the Amazon app store that exist in the Play store, and there are many just as good alternatives on Amazon's.<br/><br/>Overall:<br/>I love this phone! If you can live without having "native" support for the apps on Google's Playstore, then I recommend this phone!<br/>However, if you absolutely must have native support and don't want to "sideload" apps, then this phone is not for you.<br/>In conclusion, since I am a huge Amazon fan and am also not tied down Google's Play store, this phone is "almost" perfect for me (four stars)!
While the UI takes some getting used to and for those that are more used to the iOS (I have used iPhones exclusively for about 5 years now) I am very pleased with this phone. There are some quirks that take getting used to, which may be solved by delving deeper into the settings but that will come with time.<br/><br/>I don't like how it saves pictures from the net, not to your own personal photo roll but in a separate file. Not that this is really a problem, you can do everything you want with it from the browser in terms of sending it to where you want it but it was less intuitive at first I feel.<br/><br/>Firefly is amazing, in very particular situations. I have not tried it with video yet but when it comes to music it has been spot on every time. Particularly nice when driving or riding and hearing a song that I do not know, allows for quick access to the app without much interference to what I am doing and an almost instant ID of the song in question.<br/><br/>The amazon store built in is nice, as is the kindle reader. Though the store app makes it hard to do anything but shop and look at your orders. (no access to help or anything like that) it is still good, if anything it is too good, too easy and makes for impulse buying I would think...most likely part of the plan.<br/><br/>Battery life:<br/>This is my main beef with the phone and it may be that I have to streamline and optimize things on my end. As I said, I am still working around with it and its settings. The sleep screen will, by default, stay on for a rather long time so if you do not fix that you will see your phone dead before the end of the work day if you tend to use your phone to check the time and are not good about clicking it back to a black screen.<br/><br/>The controls are familiar and easy to use, though I will accidentally hit the camera button on the side I am willling to deal with that for the ease of which I can pull the camera up and use it with just that one button.<br/><br/>Overall, I suggest this to most people especially if you want something a bit different from the norm in terms of smart phones...but not different enough to make it weird.
being part of a family plan i got this for myself and passed my old iphone on to someone else in the family.<br/><br/>starting up: no problem it was quick and easy to get started and to transfer my stuff over.<br/><br/>Call quality and text: i have had zero issues with receiving or dropping calls. i have asked my friends, family and co-workers if the voice quality in my phone calls has suffered since i switched from my iphone and they have not noticed a change at all. less then zero problems with the text.<br/><br/>Battery life: not going to lie this was my biggest worry not only has it not been an issue it's actually exceeded my best wishes. even with heavy uses of GPS navigator, games, podcast, music, and general internet uses for a whole day and 6 hours of driving without charging and i was fine for battery life at 48% at the end of the day.<br/><br/>Touch screen: I don't really now how to judge this other ten to say i cannot tell the difference between this and my iphone.<br/><br/>screen: great display as good as my iphone if not better.<br/><br/>Speaker: good quality but hardly in the same class as the stereo if that is what you are look for or something. on the same class as an iphone better a bit better was not as scratchy maybe because of the top speaker but i didn't use the iphone much as a speaker for my music or calls.<br/><br/>Camera: love having the camera button. I cannot tell if it is noticeably faster or slower than my iphone in loading up but the picture quality is amazing.<br/><br/>Apps: not as many apps from amazon store as itunes or google play but all the one i uses and as it is a android base for the OS i could sideload anything i want including google play but have not used it for anything yet.<br/><br/>video: video is great and plays fast for amazon content and youtube.  i have yet to really try it on with something else as i don't want to watch much on my phone besides maybe a short funny video to show my friend.<br/><br/>amazon feature: dynamic perspective and firefly are fun but don't really and or subtract anything for me. i have to admit i use firefly a lot more than i thought i would to comparison shop this holiday season.<br/><br/>Headphone: cool looking and great quality for included headphones. with the magnets in the earbuds and the flat wire these should be standard in all included headphones for any phone.<br/><br/>i paid a dollar for this phone and got a year of prime included and the headphone that are $20+ on amazon or in stores. To protect it since it has glass on both sides i got a Cush Cases Extinguisher Series Heavy Duty Cover for $6 dollars that comes with a little kickstand for the phone.<br/><br/>so far great buy will update as i continue to own it.
The phone was a gift from my spouse. We are very integrated with the Amazon services and content so the phone is a win and makes a lot of sense for us. With the new family library and profiles we are integrated with all our devices for our family.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Prime music and Prime Stations right in my phone<br/>-Prime Instant video, photos, documents, all cloud storage it's available right in the device as well as all my kindle books.<br/>-Major apps are available like FB, Twitter, instagram, Pinterest, etc.<br/>-Prime subscription is now extended for another year so that is a plus. We use Prime regularly.<br/>-Amazon customer service is way awesome. No complaints there as opposed to dealing with other companies that don't care about their customers.<br/>-The Mayday feature is great for troubleshooting stuff and finding how things work (it takes time to get used to the device as I transitioned from Apple) it is a blessing for me. I used it the first couple of days frequently and their team was very helpful.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-My main complain: The phone came with an AT&T; SIM card but I could not activate the device over the phone or online and had to go to a store. What a waste of time when at the time AT&T; was the sole provider. Amazon and AT&T; need to work on this, it's annoying to go to store to activate when there is no reason to.<br/>-Apps like Runkeeper, Health4me, and others are not yet in the app store. I have a premium subscription to RK so it's a bummer it's not available.  I contacted Amazon to request the apps I need. I filled out a form for the development team. Let's see how that works and how long it takes.<br/>-Battery life needs to be managed. I learned the hard way the first few days. I changed some of the settings and now I'm good.it's a learning curve same thing happened with the IPhone.<br/><br/>Overall it's a good device for me and it fits well into my lifestyle. I like my Fire and how seamlessly I am integrated with all my other family devices. Great purchase.
This is the first generation of the Amazon Fire Phone and it has highs and lows, but remember, it is the first one ever made. Amazon did a great effort to create something new and unique which is why I give it five stars. This phone has a lot of tricks already shown in the product's presentation. I bought it and the first thing to catch my eye was the 3D display which makes the phone more attractive to use. The phone has improved with new upgrade to Fire OS 3.5.1. which makes battery life stronger, and it doesn't get as hot as it used to do (just like normal phones hot). This upgrade makes older accusations of the phone irrelevant.<br/>  The firefly function works excellent. You can "shazam" almost everything. In the US it works perfectly. You want to know what that movie you are watching in your tv is? or the movie that is playing in a Walmart display tv? No problem, activate firefly and there you can find it in matter of seconds. Wait, you don't know the song in the radio you are just loving? Ok, activate firefly, let it hear a few seconds, and like magic the song appears in your phone with description and price at Amazon. If you are at the grocery and  there is an item you want but you think it's too expensive, then use the firefly to search better prices at Amazon Prime or normal Amazon.<br/>  The apps store has many games, maybe not all the apps you would find in the App Store but it has many, and there are many deals. Oh, and everyday there is a different paid game which is free to download. There is the kindle's library, amazon instant video, and many more other amazon only features that makes Amazon Prime and Amazon Fire Phone more attractive at the eye.<br/>  The camera is good quality, it has a lot of editing features and many modes of taking a picture. You can make a panorama display or lenticular photo which makes the phone even greater. The video looks good but with both camera's and video's zoom it looks kind of blurry.<br/>  Now, this phone is way different than leading phone at the market but making a transition to this phone is not that difficult. You want itunes music, then you just plug your phone to the mac or pc and transfer the music just as it is, and the same with other music types. I think the photos are the same thing, but I'm not 100% sure. By the way, with Amazon Prime you can have free streaming music from almost every device and it fits perfectly with the Fire Phone. You can now have Prime Stations too which is the same as itunes radio but for Amazon. Watching movies in Amazon instant video is so easy and efficient. You can have the x ray description of each scene at any given time, with characters included at the scene, and many more things.<br/>  This phone has many flaws and many things that you can't compare to leading phones. It needs upgrades and tweaks from time to time to make the phone even more practical. This phone is for people who want a new thing, a different thing to use as their communication device. Look this phone as a developer's phone, it is brand new, people are getting to know the phone and Amazon will look at reactions and hear comment to make the phone better and to make other phones better than before. This phone has great potential, it's just you have to be opened to the idea that this phone, this AMAZON phone, is not centered to add APPLE products, and other companies products to their phone. They want to make the phone as "amazon" as possible. Don't expect to have itunes and google play to phone that has nothing to do with them. When buying the Fire Phone, think of it as it is.A new company phone, new, unique features, different system, different medias used, etc. Don't compare this to the iphone or the samsung galaxy. If you don't want change, stay with those brands, if you do, go for Amazon Fire Phone. REMEMBER THIS IS THE FIRST AMAZON FIRE PHONE EVER BEEN CREATED. It's the first one, not the perfect one.
Ok first off. I'm giving this phone a 4 star because it does exactly what a good smart phone is supposed too.<br/><br/>1. Great call quality<br/>2. Texting is intuitive and easy to adapt<br/>3. Screen quality great<br/>4. Audio with headphones is outstanding<br/><br/>All for .99 cents<br/><br/>Now I'm always an early adapter so this review is based on the merits considering this is Amazon's first foray into the smart phone area. There is some bumps to overcome. First run products have their bugs and whoever jumped on the Fire Phone bandwagon should understand this and be open minded with their reviews.<br/><br/>Amazon has the ability to address these bugs and upgrades with their software updates and even now they have addressed some of these.<br/>The most annoying thing to me is that Text notifications are only audible. No screen light up when you get one like you do when you get a call.<br/>Another is not being able to delete ALL call history or voice-mails at once.<br/><br/>I'm confident that future updates will address these minor issues.<br/><br/>Battery is not as bad as people are saying once you get passed the learning curve.<br/>(Battery usage is always gonna be horrible on a new phone in the first few weeks cause your constantly exploring it at first)<br/>Once you settle down to a normal usage routine, it's on par in most cases with the iPhones... in some cases better.<br/><br/>And once you get used to the OS's navigation system (flip gestures, scrolling, tilt etc)... It's hard to go to another phone due to the fact it just feels right.<br/><br/>3D? Forget what people say. It's just plain cool to look at. Adds a personal touch to the phone.<br/><br/>I personally will hang in there with this phone and plow through the bugs. I like it that much.<br/><br/>So grab one... .99 cents!<br/>Nothing to loose  and Free Prime to boot :)
I had high hopes for this phone but alas it is a real disappointment.  I bought it on the first day or close to it, I knew that was a risk but I had had such good experiences with Amazon's tablets and Kindle that I thought it was a small risk. Wow was I wrong.  This is what I don't like:<br/><br/> So far the phone has had to be replaced twice the first two stopped working after only a couple of weeks, the problem they both had was that you could not wake them it started as having to push the button two or three times then finally they just stopped waking up.  Amazon was good about replacing them but still it was annoying to be with out a pone for three days or so.  It seems as the cause of this was putting the phone in my pocket.<br/><br/>The much hyped Dynamic Perspective is pretty cool... at first. but after you have had the phone awhile it is really just a nuisance.  If you want to see the remaining charge on the battery you have to tilt the phone, but here is the thing the phone has to be able to see your face to show the info, so you can't do it in the dark or on the sly at a meeting.  Further more why is it being hidden in the first place? Also having to tilt the phone makes it hard to read in bright light.<br/><br/>You can shake the phone to show an abbreviated setting menu and you can flick it left or right to show contextual menus.  So this shaking and flicking are not easy to do at least for me. I am not the most coordinated person so I often have to repeat the gesture over and over, this gets some odd looks from passer by and I feel silly shaking the phone over and over.<br/><br/>Mayday I have used it twice and both time they "hung up" on me.  I don't think I would have had to use it twice if they had shipped even a short instruction manual with the phone but keeping with current practice and this is not just Amazon it is everyone no instructions are sent they seem to think intuition is enough, and perhaps for some people it is, but I like to read then do not do then find out that I just completely messed up the device.  This may be because I am kind of old (57)  younger people don't seem to have the problem.<br/><br/>The feature where you can push the camera button and instantly put the phone in camera mode is annoying because the button is easy to push by accident and up pops the camera.<br/><br/>Firefly feature is almost worthless I have tried it a number of times and it only responded with an answer about 10% of the time.  Most of the time I have tried it it is because it comes up automatically when you push some button or combination of button which I do accidentally often.<br/><br/>SO it has been a couple of weeks since I left the first part of this review and I wanted to update it.  I have discovered two new problems with that Fire that really seem completely avoidable.  My bank app allows you to photograph a check to deposit it, but of course the Fire does not allow you to do that I have no idea why because my Nexus 10 tablet running the same app which is for a phone not a tablet lets me do the deposit.  Second I purchased an UP24 activity tracker and of course it will not sync to the phone using blue tooth which is the only way the UP24 device can sync.  Any way the version of Bluetooth is not supported by the Fire.  Interesting when I used Mayday to get help they said in a rather snide way it was not an Amazon app then they hung up.
I am not an APPLE person.. And didn't think I needed a phone like Fire... I do wish I had been able to get the one for $.99 but I didn't.. My hubby keeps trying to steal it... For a non techy person I find it really easy to use.. Mayday is great as is the voice activated app that comes on and tries to understand what you asked.
I bought the new fire phone when it first came out. I am doing a review today because I am so dissapointed that I spent so much money to purchase this phone and it has such limited capabilities. Unless you are a prime user and are only interested in Amazon products, you will not be completely happy with this phone. I give three stars because I do like a few features on this phone. Mostly, I am dissapointed that I cannot download apps that I need and love.
What doesn't Amazon do well? I love this phone. I had Verizon and hated their customer service- ATT is fantastic-service is outstanding. Amazon service is also exceptional- they will stay on the phone and walk you through everything which is great for a old person like me (62 and my first smart phone).  The sound quality on this phoneis great and if you are a Kindle user it's nice too see familiar stuff. I have bought 9 Kindles total (given 2 to my kids & 1 to my husband when he realized how awesome they are. And now I'm even considering getting a Paperwhite just for reading). SO minute I saw this I pre-ordered.<br/><br/> Now I have a phone that is easier to use than my old non-smart phone and will allow me to get rid of my landline.Text messaging and calling is so much easier. Also when my PC crashes on me I am covered. When I  travel to see my kids and grandkid I can take everything with me. And when I travel I can stay in contact via phone and play Words with Friends on the same phone.<br/><br/>I cannot say how much I appreciate Amazon customer service and having gone to the ATT store twice now I gotta say I'm impressed with their service too.. And service is important
Amazon's first foray into the smart phone market is a home run!
If you own and love any version of the Kindle Fire, you'll be happy with this phone.  I was hesitant to get this phone in its first release, but I live in the Amazon ecosystem and could not turn down the free year of Prime. EVERY smartphone has its pros and cons, even the best on the market, so I would not expect the Fire Phone to be perfect.  Besides, worst case scenario, I go back to my Samsung GS4 and sell this one.  However, after five days of using this phone, I've decided to keep it.  The screen is sharp and clear like my Kindle Fire HDX, the OS runs smooth and quick, the camera suits my needs perfectly fine, calls sound great, and the unique features (Dynamic Perspective, Firefly, etc.) of the phone are a bonus. The things that need improvement are: battery life, adding traffic to the map app, and adding more commonly used apps that are available on iOS and other Android phones.  I do sorely miss the removable battery for my GS4 and the Google Maps app, but I can live without them. I hope that the phone does well so that we can continue to see great improvements in future releases (like the first version of the Kindle Fire and the latest HDX).
I am an Apple Fangirl. I have had iPhones since the beginning. But, I love Amazon, I have two Kindles and I have a huge video collection on my Amazon account. I just wanted to see if this phone was any good. I have not been disappointed. The cameras are great, they take great quality photos. The Dynamic Perspective is a really cool feature, as is Firefly. The app store is a little lacking, but it had all of the apps I use on a daily basis. The version of Siri is also wonderful, she is much better at voice recognition than Apple. I use it to text frequently. I am all and all happy with this phone.
I read the reviews for this phone after I already ordered it and  worried I would hate it. I have had it now for 2 weeks and love it. It is just like my kindle but can make calls and text messages. The reason for 4 stars vs. 5 is due to battery life which lasts me most of the day if I have no evening plans.
I had a Verizon Cell for years. I never kept it charged and I used less then 10 min of talk time a month unless I was traveling. It was just a phone to me. I live in a area that service is spotty. So I wanted a new Kindle, my daughter's kindle died (was first gen) and I know I needed a update to me cell. So I'm a heavy Amazon user and have had prime for years, I read 2 to 3 books a week and keep track of my life on my computer that transfers to my tablet. This was a must, the kindle phone is user friendly and fast enough for me. When the phone uses the battery to fast I make changes to the programs I have on my phone as I did my Kindle tablet. I keep it on Airplane mode when I'm at home and the battery will last 2 or 3 days even with my constant use. I have had a few small issues and I hit the mayday and I have instant assistance. Amazon has a good phone here and I especially like that the Echo and the phone work together. I now don't even have to sit down to add items to my list.<br/><br/>What I needed on a cell phone;<br/><br/>Text to speech and then to read from the spot it left off.<br/><br/>WiFi<br/><br/>good hands free.<br/><br/>durable.<br/><br/>good camera.<br/><br/>ability to listen to music.<br/><br/>Essentially I needed my kindle to have cell service.<br/><br/>Cons;<br/><br/>not all apps are made for kindle phone.<br/><br/>This phone is just right for me, I tried to use my daughters cortana phone and it was not that easy and slow. I tried my Dads Iphone and was hard to find what I wanted.
Got it on sale for $180. With a great specs, I thought it was good deal. But after a few days of use, I'm kinda disappointed. First, there is no back button and the gesture command for "back" is annoying and will work as "scroll down"  most of the time  even when you start from the edge of the bottom screen as the instruction suggests. Second, there is no auto-rotation control in the sub-panel. You have to go directly to settings find the auto-rotation menu before you can either turn it off or on. It's a lot of work for something you need to change a lot especially when playing movies from browser. Third, the speakers sounds dull and cheap. The earphone that comes with the phone is good enough (feels loose though).<br/><br/>Most people complain about not having google play store but it is not a problem for me as I was able to install one (just search how on google). What bothers me most is the battery life. The battery easily drains and can get hot if use the phone actively (watching movies, playing games) for longer period of time.<br/><br/>Over-all, the phone is decent with good display (though only 720x1280), good camera (but not as fast especially when hdr or best shot is turned on) and snappy enough (but could be laggy sometimes, especially with non-Amazon apps). For $180, arguably the best phone at that price range. But if you're willing to add just a few dollars, LG G2 is available now for only $205 which I think is far better than the fire phone. For just $25 more, you get a lot.
Was kind of hesitant on purchasing a new Fire Phone. My worries were short lived. This phone is awesome. If you have an upgrade coming up be sure to check this one out before purchasing a different phone, The fire phone is user friendly and do so many new things.  You are going to love it!!!!
I am very pleased with the Fire Phone. I don't know why so many didn't like it, but am thankful I didn't listen to them. It's a great device. I actually use it far more as a computer and camera than as a phone. I mainly use the wi-fi connection and don't need much data. The apps are great.
Different from my old iPhone but love the features. Still learning all the tricks it can do. Really like the ability to access stuff with a flick of the wrist. The Mayday feature is great. I have only used it once but it was great to just ask a question and have an immediate answer.
The phone functions work very well. The rest of the functions work like my Kindle, so they sync well. I would add the "and" symbol to both keyboards. Not sure why it wasn't included.  I already had a Kindle and the phone is so similar that the Kindle has become almost redundant.
I have had my fire phone for about 5 months now and no issues. I have read through alot of negative reviews about this phone and the most common complaint is it doesnt fit the "lifestyle". Like most phones are geared towards productivity this one is geared to to be a multimedia device. If your a person like me i was careful making my decision on what to buy and wieghed the options, I listen to music all day at work at lunch I stream a 30 minute TV episode. I track my time worked at different jobsites, keep records of water chemistry, make notes with everything, check emails, navigate anywhere i need to ETC.... I honestly dont know what anyone has to complain about except not having the fire phone.  And yes the assistant/app store is not advanced like SIRI or google but the phone kicks ass. Kicks so much ass that the new versions of Iphones are being modeled right now after what amazon has done with the dynamic display technology. I'm super happy and attached to this device it does everything I need it to. The real Gimmicks are hand writing something on your phone or, my phone is also my tv remote, or the "FULL HD VIDEO RECORDING" selling point. My opinion this is the most advanced phone on the market with more procesing power than most desktop computers. Buy it you wont be dissapointed the big downside is its limited market to AT&T; subscibers.
This phone has everything and more! Perfect with fab graphics. AMAZON did it again. Top-notch phone-gamer-research-anything you need!!!
The Fire Phone is all that I expected. Of course, I do use Kindle Fire HDX so the phone features were something I was familiar with using.  The only difference is Firefly and the Dynamic Perspective. I am also a user of Iphone and Ipads, so I am familiar. The other phones in my house are Samsung's used by my husband and son.<br/><br/>Therefore, I do have some learning curve to conquer.  This was helped by the Quick Start guide that is on the main screen of apps preloaded.<br/><br/>I am an average user of a smartphone. No techie stuff.<br/><br/>1. The phone is a nice size. Screen is bigger and clearer than my Iphone 4s.<br/><br/>2. Most used icons easy to find and even easier if you use the carousel and pin them to the front.<br/><br/>3. The phone keypad is large and easy to see. Can't miss a number here.<br/><br/>4. You can swipe to get to the quick menus on right / left/ top of screen or use the tilt built in. Left menu gives you quick access to your phone rather than hunting through icons. Right is like an information menu. On my main page my weather shows up here. I know there can be more.<br/><br/>5. I have read many reviews where people complain they cannot get the tilt function to work. I had no problem once I watched the quick start. Holding in your right or left had slightly tilt your hand/wrist to the left for the left menu and then tilt back to the right to close. Same procedure for the left menu, tilt right slightly and then left.  For the top menu which has your quick access to settings, wireless, flashlight just like the iPhone tilt your wrist forward to open and then back to close. For me this was more like a quick flick handshake. As I stated watching the quick start helps. Problematic?  Just use the swipe from the top / left / or right as you would other phones.<br/><br/>6. Firefly. No, it does find everything but are you watching tv. Find that infomercial interesting. Use Firefly. It will capture that phone number or web address that is so fleeting at times. Same use if you are walking down the street and see something interesting with a phone number attached. No digging for a pen. Just turn on firefly and it will capture it for you. I tried it to search for a tv show while watching American Pickers. In about 10 seconds it found the show, the episode, date first aired. Trying on some older shows it could not find. Oh well. It is supposed to work to identify music, tv shows, and movies.  Also, it does identify barcodes. Tried this at a Walmart for a toy. Identified and gave the Amazon price etc. I don't think yet that I can just point it at an object and have it tell me what it is.  It is a phone after all. I am anxious to try it on music when I know the song but not the title or artist.<br/><br/>7. Dynamic Perspective. Kind of cool. The daily screensaver shows day, date, and time plus this photo is in 3D for the dynamic perspective.  On Maps it you tilt it will show you nearby restaurants etc if you are in an unfamiliar city/town.  In your photos if you tilt and have dates attached to the photos it will show you when the photo was taken. Kind of neat if you have a short memory or older photos.<br/><br/>8. I have had no problem with the phone getting hot. Although I have had that problem with my computers and my Kindle Fire and iPads. I think this is more of an air circulation problem. Ie: holding device incorrectly or as with my laptop and other tablets l a lying on a place without proper air flow.<br/><br/>Battery life is good if you use it as a phone and not your main play thing. My phone stayed charged for almost 3 days in standby. Used for a few text messages and normal calls for me.<br/><br/>Yes, Amazon Apps are limited but you can choose to let the phone download android apps from other sources.  Will they work, that is questionable because of the OS. As my husband said and he does not use his smartphone for much more than calling, the apps will be created with time just as with other devices.<br/><br/>Do I like this phone?  YES.
but it's been hard.  Of course, the link to my Amazon/Amazon Prime account is great - one of the big selling points for  me.  For perspective, I am coming from an iPhone 4s - I have an iPhone 5C from my employer. I never went to the 5s for a personal phone because I did not see any big advantages, I was waiting for the 6 which supposedly had a bigger screen, one of my big beefs about my iPhone.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>  *  BATTERY LIFE - Another selling point for me according to Ads/Descriptions, but unfortunately, it is AWFUL. I purposely charged it 100% the other night and took it off the battery at 11PM.  Used it once to look up something on SILK at 12PM, and didn't touch it the rest of the night. I woke up, it was at 63%. I called Mayday, he suggested I turn off auto-push on my e-mail (good suggestion, I did that on my iPhone also); turn on Airplane mode - NOT an option - renders the phone useless for what I use it for, no phone or internet, it becomes an expensive iPod; turn off Wi-fi whenever I am not using it - this is also a relatively useless solution, I use my phone to surf all the time, it's only a good option if I am out traveling, etc. otherwise I would be turning it on and off every 10 mins; turn off Dynamic Perspective - this is their biggest selling point - why did I get the phone then?<br/>  *  Apps - This has been somewhat a "thorn" with my Kindle also - it's not true Android, so even tho it uses some Android apps, it won't use all, and can become frustrating. The number and range of apps available is getting better, but many I am used to having on my phone are not available, like Living Social.<br/>  *  Bluetooth - Had lot of trouble getting the Bluetooth to my car to work, it's still not as smooth as my iPhone was.  I got it connected easily the first time, but the next time I started my car it would not connect, and after an hour with Mayday people it still was not paired/connected. The next day it did pair and connect, but it's not smooth - my iphone connected as soon as I turned the car on, this takes several minutes, and when I get back in the car it does not seem to automatically start where I left off like my iPhone (I use mostly Audiobooks) - I always have to take the phone out, and press play on the app to get it started.<br/>  * Keyboard - it seems smaller than my iPhone, and there is no way to change the size. I did find if you use it horizontally it is somewhat larger, but not how I usually use it.<br/>  * Speaker for music - sounds a little "tinny", haven't figured out how to adjust settings yet - if that can be done, it may help.<br/><br/>PROS<br/>  * Seamless connection to my Amazon/Prime account is the huge selling point here for me - free music, video, automatic access to all my "stuff". The phone came loaded with all the apps, books , music and videos that I had in my account.<br/>  * Dynamic Perspective - this is great, but since I have had to turn it off to get any battery life out of the phone , it's a "wash"<br/>  * Mayday button - I have LOVED this since I got my new Kindle last year, and I have already used it at least 10 times - no fumbling around for an hour to figure something out, and the help desk people are knowledgeable and friendly. Had trouble connecting at times - not because there were too many people, it just said "not available - try again", but that seems to have gotten better as the days go by.<br/>  *  Size is perfect, nice sized screen without being one of those big monsters which I can't comfortably hold in my hands.<br/>  *  Voice recognition - really good, better than SIRI<br/>  *  Camera button - love having a button to turn the camera on without touching the screen, tho it seems I do hit it by accident quite a few times. I'm sure once I get used to it I will do that less.<br/><br/>Still not sure I will keep it - I haven't gotten rid of my iPhone yet. Amazon's customer service is exceptional, and just like the iPhone, I expect they will update the software as the bugs surface and are reported. I am liking it more everyday, as I get more used to it, so we will have to see.<br/><br/>ADDENDUM - I've upgraded to 4 stars, the battery is much better today, I've turned Dynamic Perspective back on to see what happens. MAYDAY is still great, and have now been able to add my own ringtones. Slowly but surely...<br/><br/>Downloading my music from the cloud on to device is cumbersome, have to do it one song at a time, but they are putting it in as an enhancement request, to do multiple or all, so we will see. I'm sure there will be an update release after a month or so. I'm thinking this WILL work for me.<br/><br/>UPDATE: As time goes by, the drama diminishes, and I have kept my Fire Phone. Still disappointed with lack of certain apps, I'm still hopeful that as time goes by they will add more (Google being one, as another reviewer suggested). I really love a lot of features, some others have become a  daily annoyance.  I still press the camera button, and usually log enough that Firefly comes on, even when I AM trying to use the camera - but on the same topic, I do love having the camera button so handy. All in all, working fine for me, it does what I need it to do for the most part. One BIG issue I am having is with the charging - it just will not charge with any cable but the one that came with it or my kindle, even tho it is standard mini usb.  I do have to admit, that now that the iPhone is coming out with the 6 which is pretty much the same size, I wish I had waited. Without my upgrade options, it will be too expensive to switch them now, so I will just have to wait.
Let me first start by saying that I use my phone as it should be used...as a phone.  It doesn't stay stuck to my hand every waking second of my life.  I don't do social media because my life is MINE not everyone else's.  If you want to converse with me, pick up the damn phone and call me.  I'm not of fan of games because I am an adult.  So in saying that, my phone is awesome because it does what I want it to do.  It rings when I have a call. It bleeps when I have a text message.  I do have my email on it but only because my email/internet carrier at home sucks butt and it's faster to look at it on my phone than go into my computer and pull CenturyTel's slow speed dinosaur internet up and try to look through them.  Yes, it would be nice to change to someone else but unfortunately CenturyTel has the monopoly where I live and we cannot get anyone else.  Thought that was against the law but what do I know.  Sorry, I digress back to the phone.  So I guess since I don't use my phone like 98% of other folks, this review may not be what anyone is looking for.  But I do indeed like my phone.  Oh and for those of you who will say that I'm like my home internet provider, a dinosaur because I don't do social media and my phone isn't my best buddy, you can KMA.  My life is not like an open book.  Think about it.
I was Leary of purchasing the fire phone but having a kindle and liking it I went with the fire. The system is different than Android but it's very fast and very advanced. I would have given it five stars but I have only had it two weeks. Great phone!
Just got the phone today and was concerned it would be hard to use. It seems to be a very user friendly phone even with all the features that are on it.<br/><br/>I'm 61 years old and have limited knowledge of cell phones but I can use this one already with very little trouble. If I can use it any one can.<br/><br/>very clear screen and I could see it fine out side.<br/><br/>I would recommend this phone as of now.
I really love this phone, just wish it had a slot for an sd card. Other than that it is great.1080 HD quality, 13 megapixel camera, Amazon Prime, and the live tech support right at the push of a button is unmatched in the cell phone industry!
I have to say that I bought this phone almost entirely for its functionality as a phone, so I don't really care that much about the availability (or lack thereof) of apps, and so I am not commenting on or reviewing that aspect of the phone, with one exception*.  As a phone it works just fine.  I also have to say that I really enjoy the lock screens with dynamic perspective. I enjoy seeing the new scene each day (obviously, though, this is not enough of an advantage to buy the phone, it's just a little lagniappe).  I also am moderately pleased with the ability to shake the phone to change screens, but it doesn't always work smoothly for me.  The "firefly" feature hasn't meant that much to me, but I could see circumstances in which it would come in handy; people who do a lot of comparison shopping, for example, might find it really useful.  For my purposes I would say that the phone is just a little bit better than I would have expected, and so I am happy with it, especially since I got it for 99 cents.  *App exception:  Since I don't have a Kindle fire or any android tablet or phone, I'm glad I got this because it let me download the Amazon Echo app in case I get selected (hint, hint Amazon) to purchase an Echo.
Really like this phone. It feels like it's between devices from the big three in that you get the best of each once you learn the device. Plus, go to developer options and it opens up straight Android to power users. Great little device.
Well, what a disappointment from the AMAZON gods!! Yeah anything new is nice and faster BUT this phone does not support apps that we need for our use, like our home security camera system. Also, when we went to the ATT store to start-up they had issues with transferring files like music, pics and contacts because the cable was not compatible and it was working very slowly. REALLY!!! Then on the ATT website there is an explanation to transfer your contacts from any phone to the FIRE--yeah well that doesn't work either. If I can't transfer my contacts then why am I going to be bothered with this phone. The dynamic perspective is cool but annoying and the wrist flick to switch screens is not 100%. The battery is absolutely horrible -- can't even go 12 hours without having a dead phone. You can actually see the battery diminish in use as you are doing anything due to the screen brightness--seriously! As quick as we got these phones is as quick as they are going back to Amazon. See you at the UPS store tomorrow!!
I love this phone! It did take some adjusting to switch from the iPhone, but worth it for the bigger screen, prime membership and the awesome dynamic perspective feature. I want more games to utilise it because it is fantastic!!
Like others have said I really wanted to love my phone.  For the first time I was buying the latest, newest gadget on the market.  Alas, it's just okay.  If you don't really use apps and are good with that then its a perfectly respectable phone.  It makes calls, when you get used to certain things like the visual voicemail etc., then that stuff works fine.  Firefly is cool. The camera/pictures are decent. But, if you actually use apps then you are probably going to be disappointed.  Even something as basic as the Starbucks app is unavailable. There are other purchases I had been thinking of making i.e the Petcube, which is a interactive camera to use with your pets while away.  Unfortunately anything that involves you going to Googleplay to download is not available for this phone.  So you've basically sentenced yourself to not having access to a lot of what we expect from a Smartphone.  I miss my basic menu button too.  The phone isn't extremely intuitive.  The bottom line is, if I was able to do it over again, I wouldn't get this phone.  I am hoping Amazon is busy working on improving access to apps so the phone will be a whole heck of a lot more useful.
i love my new amazon fire phone. i was hesitant at first to get the phone because of some of the reviews, but im so glad i did, i absolutely love it. i am very very happy. i have amazon fire tv and my pictures and videos upload right from my phone to my tv  love it. my phone and tv r connected and so is my kindle. i love u amazon keep up the good work. the phone was very easy to figure out not complicated at all.  i just wish i could download some of the ringtone apps that i had on my old phone like zedge and some others, but im not complaining. love love the fire phone.
This is a great phone.  Very easy to use and works seamlessly with Amazon content and other features.  I am an AT&T; user which made this an easy buy (note: the phone is clean from other "useless" AT&T; apps that often clutter other smart phones).  The user interface is spectacular and the one hand navigation is intuitive and easy to use.  The number of negative reviews is surprising and not representative of my experience (former GS4 user).  If you're looking for a new smart phone are are an Amazon user (Prime customer) you should check out this phone.
This is a great phone if you are3 already familiar with the Amazon Fire tablets. Works as advertised. More and more apps are<br/>now available for it. Very good audio and works fine with my Bluetooth hearing aids too.
I have been waiting to write my review until now, I have had the phone since the day it came out. The first weekend I had it I was worried I had made a mistake, it did seem to get hot when I was using it and I found myself having to charge it at work even though I had barely used it. By Monday I was very discouraged about the battery life so I decided to read some of the reviews of the phone to see what other people were saying, one of the reviews mentioned turning off the notifications on most apps and I have to say that helped a lot. Then my son mentioned downloading an advanced task killer app and that helped even more. I started work today at 0600 with a 100% charge and when I left work at 1900 it had a 75% charge left. I used the phone multiple times during the day to check email, send a few text and even look at Facebook. Two days ago I played a movie on the phone when I was at home to check battery useage and it only used about 15% for a 2 hour movie. The phone got a little warm during the movie but not hot.<br/>  I had no trouble getting my calender from my iPhone, all I had to do was put in my email.address and all my appointments showed on my calander. My  contacts were also not a problem, since I had a month to wait after I ordered my phone until it arrived I added my contacts to my kindle HDX so they were there when I logged into my phone the first time.<br/>  There are some apps I had on my iPhone that I wish  would be on my fire phone, but I am hoping that with time some will be,  but I knew what was available before buying the phone by looking through the app store, no surprises.<br/>  I am not sure about all the complaints about AT&T;, every ad said only AT&T.;<br/>  I am very happy with my phone so far, no problems with the Bluetooth in my car, or call quality when on the phone, for a first generation phone I think it is great, I will not be returning this phone! Good job Amazon!
As a rule, I am not fond of cell phones<br/> I totally love this phone. It is simple to use, the features are easy to understand, and the display is awesome. It takes great photos and video. I'm very happy with it.
I really like the fire phone. I'm not sure why so many people don't. This phone is on par with most of the smart phones out there. The free year of amazon prime made the decision for me. Having free prime really makes getting this phone a no brainer. The firefly app Is great fun and I love having my books and music automatically right where I need them. It takes pretty good photos too.I have no clue how to change the ringtone to a downloaded ring and figuring out how to access everything on the phone takes some getting used to, also the battery does not last very long. Hence the four stars. I'd say, include a manual ( it's a different operating system, people will need it) and fix the battery life and amazon has a phone just as good as Apple.<br/>Ok now after reading other reviews I get it, most people are upset over google aps. Eye roll. I'm an adult and don't even have the Facebook app. I don't really use aps. I have twitter and vine and that's about it, so if you are really into aps...I guess I can see. That just isn't my thing. The batter life however is a real drawback.
The Amazon fire has many great features but then again lacks at the same time. Device does not navigate easily like your Android and Apple equipment. Poor battery life even after OS update and with location services turned off. I had much higher expectations of this device but became highly disappointed after my purchase. I should have went with the S5. Dynamic perspective Amazon prime fire fly are okay and Mayday as well but nothing else about the phone for the price is appealing. My device sometimes just shuts off for no reason and last time I was on the phone. My LG Flex and all Galaxy devices have stood the test of times with much better apps navigation I mean I can go on and on. A screenshot was the hardest thing to do and the Mayday tech had to ask around after she and I had been in the session for like 10 or 15 minutes. I've seen worse devices so that is why I'm generous with a 3 star rating plus I like Amazon as a whole but take this device back to the drawing board. When it's your 1st and premier device you need to come core correctly or don't come at all.
I love this phone. I have always had Iphones, so I was very apprehensive to switch to another type of device. The transition from my old phone to this was flawless. I have had my phone since it came out in July and I would recommend it to anyone. I cannot believe there are so many poor reviews for this phone. Yes, it does suck that I cannot use an actual google app, but going to my web browser and typing in google has just become second nature and I have completely gotten over the lack of an actual app. This phone is amazing and is backed by Amazon's wonderful customer service and goes great with all of my other Amazon gadgets (Echo, Firestick, and Kindle). Not to mention all of my Prime music, streaming, and SHOPPING!!! The phone is very user friendly and the screen looks awesome. Just cannot said enough good things about this bad boy! Any early reviews have to be taken with a grain of salt as many things can happen when a phone first comes out that are very quickly taken care of as fare as software updates and additional apps being added to the store.
This phone is absolutely amazing. It is faster than my previous phones. the call quality is above average and screen is great for watching movies or videos. I was skeptical at first but I am glad I got one.
I dig this phone.  The interface is very quick/responsive.  My work email and calendar (Outlook) ported over smoothly. In terms of the reviews where some people have phones that are running hot -- I haven't experienced this issue -- my phone stays at a normal temperature and the battery has been great (heavy user).  Prior to this phone I had the iPhone5S and HTC One Mini.  That said, it's a noticeable upgrade from the HTC One Mini and comparable (maybe slight upgrade) from my 5S.  Very happy, I'd recommend it.
i just got this phone and i really love it. it is very well constructed and very comfortable to use. the functions work well and i like the fire o.s interface a lot. i read some of the 'pro' reviews that weren't so good, but i'm finding the phone to be a real pleasure to use. i have now been using the phone for a few days and it's still great. it has a nice heft to it. the menus are all very intuitive and easy to use. i love the ability to flick and see more information about various items that i have open. it gives me notification of new emails even when the lock screen is on. i have no complaints at all about this phone.
Ignore the 1 star reviews, most of them are because Amazon does not use green energy for their servers... Big whoop... This is a great phone, especially if you already have a Kindle Fire tablet as all of your apps are there for you to use, and the ones you have in the cloud can be easily downloaded. The speakers are great, and I can easily hear music streamed through the phone across the room. The silk browswer is improved as well and will allow you to connect through a proxy server so it's more useful in more places. The camera works really well and importing contacts was pretty easy. If you are new to smart phones this one has a small learning curve as my technoloy challenged wife will attest to. She was quickly able to figure out how to take photos and then post them to facebook with little trouble and it was easier to do with the phone than on our computer. I also use it for reading books and although the screen is not as large as a tablet, ebooks are easy to read. All in all it's an excellent phone.
I was told that the sales on these were low because people were unsure of them, I LOVE IT! I'm not very good with computers and have had problems using the "smart phones"; this is very user friendly and fun, yet still has all of the bells and whistles that the androids and apple phones have. Plus it has 24hr assistance at the push of the "Mayday" button, you get a live person to help with what ever you're having problems with, used it once so far and it was great help.
The phone is great. The way the screen seems to follow you in an interesting feature. Most android apps work fine with the phone. I use it primarily for business, so I don't have any complaints.
I DON'T OWN THIS PHONE, BUT MOST OF THE REVIEWS ARE FROM A SPAMMER GIVING ONE STAR. DON'T LOOK AT THE AVERAGE STAR RATING, IT IS MOSTLY SPAM FROM A TROLL.
This is a great phone for me. It does what I like to do. I do think it may take a learning period but it has many unique features. It especially works well with other Amazon products.
Great so far. Haven't had any heat problems or trouble with battery life that other reviewers complained about. I left iPhone for the fire. I wasn't unhappy with the iPhone but had been a satisfied Amazon customer for a long time, and used their services for all of my music and books.<br/>It is nice to have the direct link and quick purchase for Amazon products. The tilt menus are handy and didn't take long to master. The firefly technology is a real time saver for contacts if you are in a good cell signal location (which seems to be superior to my old phone thus far). Though I was a bit apprehensive switching to android, the fire made it easy. The phone is a comfortable size, and the display and speakers make watching video a better experience than my old iPhone 5. The only low mark I can give is not actually on the phone but with the app store. I hope that Amazon sees fit to expand their choices of podcast apps in the future.
I was weary at first due to it not being on the Google play network. Then they offered it for .99 cents and I had to get it. It's a very solid phone has a good weight to it. I don't like that the phone id's made of glass. I feel that if I drop it it is going to shatter. So what I'm saying is get a good case. Dynamic perspective is really cool. But that's it just cool I see no benefit. The easy store stuff is pretty neat and works really well. Makes it convenient. Takes gorgeous pictures. Fire fly is awesome and cab identify so much s***. The app store is very limited but it's not the end of the world. I was able to get all apps I wanted or comparable to. Except for time hop and snap chat. You can download snap chat from the site and works great. Some if the apps are a little winery like face book and silk browser. But it is a new phone with a new os there are going to be some bugs to work out. Overall I really like my phone.
My hubby and I love the phone, you just have to not compare to other phone. May not have lots have lots of apps or Google play but we got use to it. And it's fine, great phone.
I probably won't ever use all the features available on this phone....but I am impressed with the wide variety of them!  I love the MAYDAY button...and have used it a few times. :-0)  I must say that the transfer of my contacts was not the smoothest...as AT&T; was not quite prepared for the FIRE phones!  I love the VOICE to text feature...makes my slow attempts at texting fairly quick now!  The bonus of 1-year of FREE Amazon PRIME is wonderful!  Guess where I'll be doing my holiday shopping?  :-)
Good phone but having a few problems with it.  It does start to overheat very fast, you have to double check to make sure it does not stay on when playing music.  Another problem, I tried to download music through the phone and it would not show up on the device or in the cloud.  When I went through Mayday for help, the first person could not help me and sent me to Tech Support.  That DID NOT work. The person had no idea how to fix the issue and I felt like she was just going through anything to see if something would end up working.  I had to tell her no when she said I had to 'unregister' my phone and she would have it re-registered. At the end of our conversation she mentioned Amazon was aware of this issue and were working on having it resolved.  Other than that, so far so good.  Love the phone and can't wait for Amazon to work out the last few bugs.
Lots of fun to use. Plenty of features for me.<br/>Horrible availability of minutes. Lasts only a few hours.. you should send all early buyers a new battery.<br/>H
Wonderful smart phone<br/><br/>Having come from windows phone this is a much more intuitive operating system and much easier to use. Amazon is just getting started and they hit it out of the park. All the apps a person uses are available<br/>And screened for bad stuff. I could not be happier.<br/>Looking forward to the next on as well as the new kindle reader and fire tablet. Keep em coming Amazon.
Love Amazon gadgets. I have an original Fire Kindle and various e-readers.I have ordered the latest e-reader but regret the day I spontaneously ordered this phone. It is difficult to navigate. It lacks access the Google play store thus I can not get many favorite apps. Am locked into a two year contract with AT&T; but am counting down the days when I can return to a current Galaxy model of phone.
Phone is a great product for the price, but the true gem here is Amazon MayDay!!!!! this is awesome so helpful. Never get customer service like this with Apple.
I had the fire phone for 11 days.  While I liked  the phone and loved the graphics, I could not communicate via text with about 90% of my contacts.  The help button was amazing, as were the people I spoke with.  I couldn't get it to sync with my new Expedition and I felt I was going backwords from my I-phone.  I will wait for the new I phone to come out.  Too bad, I am an amozon junkie and really wanted the fire to be my phone!!!!
Love the unlimited photo storage
Finally, transfer from Alltel to At&T; is complete, I get to use my new fire phone. We have 2, my husband & I got them at the same time. Makes it easier for both us on this learning curve.  I am really surprised at all the bad/negative reviews. Maybe this is easier for us, since we both had Kindles. It has been made abundantly clear to me anyway, that in order to enjoy this phone or a kindle for that matter, you need prime. Seriously....I can't understand why you wouldn't have it. We are pretty dedicated to Amazon, and you become more dedicated with prime. Considering my experience with Kindle, I got the phone as I knew that Amazon has great customer service, & what I would call an excellent selection of apps. Ecosystem is the correct term, I-phone is to apple, etc.<br/>& now, on to the phone; specs, likes, dislikes etc....<br/>It's big. I favor that as it is easier to see. It's pretty heavy, which will make it a little tricky to shove in a jeans/shirt pocket. Here is a huge tip:  go to ebay for your accessories; same with kindle. They are just fine, have a huge selection and are usually less than half the price of Amazon's accessories. Why this is, I don't know. Another huge tip, forgo the screen protector. Unfortunately they mess up the phones sensors which make it go black during a call. Hard to hang up without the end call button being visible. I opted for the clutch wallet style w/magnetic clasp. Does a fine job of keeping screen safe.<br/>Battery life, meh. not so great. I'm used to charging my phone at most 3 days a week. Now, it is a daily task. I'm not a real heavy user, but I do text on a daily basis, & plan to use it exclusively for my day planner. On the plus side, it charges pretty quick. I think getting a car charger is a good idea.<br/>Tutorial, vs written instructions. Again, meh. The tutorial was pretty good, and shows you if you are doing the correct actions. I prefer the written instructions, and found a good pdf on line to down load for my other questions. You'll remember I mentioned learning curve in first paragraph, no? Exactly...download the pdf, you won't be sorry! Also stumbled across info to add my ringtone to the list. Sweet!<br/>Camera/video, oh, yeah, you betcha! Won't be bothering with buying a new digital camera anytime soon, I can tell you that. This baby rocks in both camera and video mode. Display is great too. I figure the Kindle tablets were the starting point for the fire phones. I could make calls on my Kindle & thought the camera was pretty cool, & am very glad to see the fires came with both back & front cameras.<br/>Audio-call quality is fabulously clear. Those of us in Alltel/At&T; transition have suffered with crap call quality for 6 months or so. Really sad, considering it was good before the merger. The audio for everything else is good too.<br/>Screen responsiveness-it's touchy...I have been using the stylus for texting, but only for texting. The rest of it, I don't need one for.<br/>Amazon did a fine job with their entry into the phone market. I'll buy another, for sure. At&T; is an unknown commodity at this time for us. I see a lot of people don't care for them. We didn't have much say so...but I'm very willing to give them a try if it means getting a fire phone.<br/>BTW, I am not affiliated with Amazon in anyway, like having stock or a relative working for them. I pay my prime membership every year but not this year thanks to the prime promo offered with the phone!<br/>UPDATE***********************************<br/>Ok, things did not go as planned after the review. Not at all. For some bizarre reason, wi-fi quitting working on my phone. NO connections would show up. At&T; worked with me, and we did the reset thingy, to no avail. I know a lot of folks give At&T; a hard way to go, but they really put some troubleshooting effort into this. Sooo, I called Amazon. We did same thing (as At&T;), with same results. They had me to download and send some crash/event logs, & promised to get back with me. Not so much...that shocked me as I have never had a problem with Amazon's customer service. It was pretty straight forward to me, but I kept getting reps who drug this out for about 3 days. All I want was to exchange the phone for one that worked, & I was getting the run around. "Our techs are checking into this, it may take awhile." Not so handy for me. But luckily, this ends well...on the 4th call to Amazon, I got lucky and Wyhela J took my call. She is beyond awesome!  She said, no problem, we'll exchange; it's all good. & guess what? New phone has worked exactly like it is supposed to. I do want to mention battery life is better than I figured it would be. I'm guessing too, the learning curve & potentially the other phone had issues. Believe it or not, I do recommend this phone & would buy another!
I purchased the phone two weeks ago and a few minor changes would make this a 5 star phone.<br/>Pros: (1) If you have Amazon Prime this is an awesome device. Other videos also play well and the display is comparable to phones of similar size. (2) Other Amazon features including Firefly are very useful if you regularly buy from Amazon. (3) Camera takes very good pics and video. Auto focus and flash have worked perfectly in multiple environments. (4) The phone is relatively easy to navigate. I switched from an iPhone and I had most everything figured out in an afternoon.<br/>Cons: (1) Lack of a good music player. Amazon prime music app is good for streaming. The 2nd music player focuses on your music purchases through Amazon. That player will let you get a max of 250 songs credit for songs you upload but does not play music you load on your phone. This is a pain if you have lots of purchases from other providers or rip music from physical music media. I did find a workable music app to play music I loaded on my phone but it it would be better if I could control the music from the lock screen when it is playing without having to unlock the phone. (2) Lack of apps. I looked through the app store prior to purchase and found most of the apps I wanted. I later learned I forgot to specify fire phone only because some of those apps were for kindle. I was able to side load apps by downloading them to a PC from Google play, uploading to dropbox, downloading to my phone, then opening the app. I was able to get all the apps I wanted this way except for two that would not install properly and the Google apps which are incompatible with this phone.<br/>Overall thoughts: For a first attempt. I think Amazon did a pretty good job. I use my phone a lot for work and it is good with email and documents. It's also good for the short breaks of playing games. If you use Amazon regularly or subscribe to Prime and can live with limitations on apps, this phone is for you. If you just want a functional phone and don't really care about anything other than email, camera, social media, and popular games then this is a great phone for the price (99 cents with a free year of Prime). It is not perfect but hopefully Amazon will fix my issues with software updates and make an even better phone next time.
It really burns me up that people are commenting who clearly do not own this phone. It's an abuse of the customer review section and I think Amazon would be totally justified in deleting these comments that are obviously made to drive the overall rating of the phone down.<br/><br/>That said, I do own this phone and it's getting a lot of hate -but not from me. Is this phone a flop as everyone says? I don't think so.<br/><br/>I have used a smartphone for about 4 years now - before this phone I had an iPhone 4s. Making the switch was a little hard at first because I wasn't used to Android and I missed some functionality from the iPhone but I think the features more than make up for it.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>- Unlimited photo/video storage in the cloud. I have two kids - this has been amazing and the cloud is very easy to access. My husband also pulls photos/videos from the cloud using my account.  I never could figure out how to access the iCloud and was never certain that my photos/videos were backed up.<br/><br/>- User-friendly - considering the above statement that I could never figure out iCloud, I'm the saddest Millenial that ever was. I think this phone is rather intuitive and the may-day feature has been very useful<br/><br/>- Price - it cost me $.99 and I got a free year of Prime (was already a Prime member, so it was just extended a year)<br/><br/>- Syncing devices - I have a Kindle and Fire TV and I like watching and viewing my content across all devices<br/><br/>- Screen Sharing - I can "mirror" my screen of my Fire Phone on my Fire TV - this is useful for some of my side-loaded apps when I want to watch something on my Fire TV that the Fire TV doesn't have an app for.<br/><br/>- Charged with mini-USB - I have a few devices that use a mini-USB charger so I can have one charging cable to use on them all. I don't have to pack all kinds of cables when I travel. It holds a charge for a long time as well. And a mini-USB cable is very cheap - around $5 for an extra one.<br/><br/>- Size - starting at 32GB, this is much more phone than I'm used to. I'm used to buying the bottom-rung 8GB iPhone, so this is a very nice perk.<br/><br/>CONS<br/>- Sometimes it can be slow - this hasn't bothered me too much but it's not as fast as my iPhone was.<br/><br/>- Side loading apps - It's not a big deal to side load apps so you can use Snap Chat (I said I was a Millenial, right?) and Voxer - but it won't alert you when these apps have messages/are updated. It's not really a big deal to me though.<br/><br/>- Firefly/Dynamic Perspective - not really a con but not a huge selling point either.<br/><br/>Honestly, I'd buy this phone again and I'm happy that I made the switch.
I got the phone on launch day and have been pretty impressed with it so far.<br/><br/>PROS:  I like the style of the phone and the ease of use going from screen to screen and App to App.  The FireFly app is very cool, but seems to have a hard time finding items that are not real common retail items.  The music and tv scans turn out good results.  I also like that it wasn't over-loaded with massive apps that I don't or won't use, compared to my previous Galaxy phones.  I have used the Mayday app twice now, both with quick and good results, so that is a great feature. The Dynamic Perspective (3D) imaging is very, VERY cool, but wish it did more in other apps and features.<br/><br/>CONS:  I HATE the camera button that is right next to the volume buttons.  I have taken random pictures of the sky and my desk, but trying to adjust the volume on the handset in the middle of a call.  I don't like the feel and durability of the glass on the back of the phone.  I have only had it for 3 days now and the back glass is scratched a tiny bit (my phone case should arrive any day now..Thank God). I don't like that I can't file my pictures in folders like I did with my Galaxy phone.  I don't really like the look of the phone contacts and wish I could scroll through the names quicker using the first letter of the name like on my Galaxy.  I was hoping for a better battery life than my Galaxy, but it does not seem to last any longer.  Of course, I am using my phone more trying to figure out things, so that might change once the "New and Cool" phase wears off.<br/><br/>So far.. that is my review in the 3 days I have had it.  I am excited to learn more about the phone so that I can do another review in a few weeks or a month.  I would highly recommend it for those looking for the new and cool thing out there.
I have a love/hate relationship with my fire phone.  I purchased when it first came out and I love pretty much all of the features and options that it has especially the ability to link over to my prime music and my prime video.  The lack of emoji in the texting capabilities and the lack of a few apps such as snap chat.  Otherwise I have really enjoyed this phone
I wanted to buy Amazon's Fire phone because I am an Amazon member and I also use Kindle Fire HDX. I basically use Amazon for most of my music, movies, books and other, such as Amazon market place. Therefore, I wanted to have easy access to all of my digital music, books, movies and market place wherever I would be. So, I bought the fire phone. As far as service goes, such as GPS, phone calls, texting, Facebook, and email, the phone works great. As far as being considered a premium phone, it is definitely compatible with other premium phones. The camera and video recording is very impressive. At the end of the day, I would have to say that it all comes down to one's own personal preference and needs.
I love this phone it is user friendly I can read on the go and it meets all my expectations for battery life based on how I use it.
a great phone, once you get used to the difference between it and an apple product you will be pleased and consider it an upgrade
TL;DR version:  The phone is great with just a couple of oversights/issues I'm sure will get fixed.<br/><br/>The Fire Phone is my first journey outside of pre-paid plans, but I felt that I was trapped in sub-standard service that the pre-paid companies provided along with phones that needed to be purchased at full price (for those phones who are current gen) or purchase a phone that was considered out of date two or three generations of phones ago.<br/><br/>I love the phone.  There is not much more to say than that.  I really don't use a phone for more than making a phone call and getting directions and the phone does that great.  Dynamic perspective is fun, and I am finding neat uses for Firefly.  The email application is super easy to set up and, for the most part, the phone is fairly intuitive (at least for me).  Being locked into the Amazon ecosystem doesn't bug me too much only because I dont use the phone to much for apps and games though I am sure some will find this as a flaw.<br/><br/>Here are are my two biggest complaints.<br/><br/>1.  Having confirmed this suspicion through a Mayday contact, at the writing of this review, there is no way to listen to Prime Music short of downloading the Amazon Music App from the Appstore.  The music app that comes pre-installed on the device will only play music you have purchased from Amazon or have uploaded to your music cloud which is nice if you do not have Prime.  The phone comes with one year of Prime meaning that you are losing out on a third of the music (arguably more considering the size of the Prime music library and I double anyone has more songs than that, short of a DJ... lol) selection you could have.  Here is my confusion.  Amazon has an proprietary application that works and has access Prime music, purchased music, and music uploaded to the cloud.  Why are they still using the app on the phone that is missing the Prime functionality?  I shouldn't have two applications for essentially the same thing.<br/><br/>2.  There is no way to remove pre-installed applications from the home screen.  With the Kindle Fire HDX, below the carousel is where your favorites are.  On the Fire Phone, below the carousel you have all of your apps that are on the device.  This means that it is essentially the Apps page from the Fire Devices.  To remove unwanted apps, I just created a folder I designated as useless apps and moved all the links that could be accessed via the left slide out bar to that location.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Amazon should have set the device up exactly like the Fires where you place your favorites below and then you have the options of going into the content type using the navigation bar across the top of the apps would take you to apps, games would take you to games, etc.<br/><br/>A lot of the people I've spoke with are upset the device does not have multiple home screens like other Android Phones.  It does.  Instead of horizontally swiping to get to other pages, they are stacked on top of each other.  I actually had it set up to where I had three pages (didn't try more than that).<br/><br/>Overall I am definitely happy with the purchase and have enjoyed using the phone.  I'm fairly sure they will fix the Amazon Music issue I described but the home screen issue I'm guessing wont as the navigation is not designed like the fire and would require a complete redesign of the OS.
I am a pretty big Amazon fan (I have amazon prime, and also a paper white kindle) so when I needed a new phone I decided to give the Fire Phone a try.  I have had the FP for about two months now and in general it seems like Amazon rushed it out too early and with too little testing.<br/><br/>Right off the bat, when I got the phone I looked through the se<br/>ttings so I can familiarize myself with doing basic functions, but I was shocked to find that a lot of options I were looking for were either in odd places or just not even available.  The Fire Phone, like the kindle fire, has the carousel home screen, which isn’t a bad set up, but you can choose what comes up there, only recently used apps will be up there, and you can remove them but only temporarily.  Also, the lack of a back button is becoming bothersome, as the only way you can go back is to flip up from the bottom of the screen, where most apps put there adds.<br/><br/>There are a number of glitches as well.  First, when on a phone call, there is a 75% chance that when call is over, the phone assumes it is still at my ear and the screen won’t turn back on.  I have to wait for the person on the other end to hang up before I can use the phone again.  Next, it is extremely fickle on when it can charge or not.  I have a 2013 Honda Accord, which has a USB port for iPod usage and charging.  My previous phone, a Motorola, would charge no problem, but the Fire Phone just connects and does nothing.  I had to get a charger from my cigarette lighter to charge my Fire Phone in my car.  In general it just seems like the Fire Phone is not very compatible with my Honda, which I never had any issues with previous phones.  Songs played via Bluetooth cut off 5 seconds too early and if I try to use the Fire Phone voice input I just end up calling myself somehow.<br/><br/>Not all is bad about the Fire Phone though.  It is very quick, especially when using the internet and the battery life is very good, even when in heavy use.  The lack of popular apps is a killer though, no major google apps, missing banking apps and little ones like cracked lite or ESPN Fantasy Football.<br/><br/>Overall the Fire Phone needs a lot of work put it has potential.  Hopefully all these reviews will get point across to the people at Amazon and future iterations of the Fire Phone will be better.
No buyer's remorse for me - i still have a good feeling about it when i use, see or think about it.  When the battery is being consumed too quickly, i go into Settings > Applications & Parental Controls > Manage applications> Filter by Running Services, click on unneeded non-critical apps that i may have started for a one-shot usage, and "Force Quit" them.  Force quitting is "sticky" until you use the app again, and it persists across soft resets.<br/><br/>I don't indiscriminately try and load apps - i have other things i need to do to be productive. I only use apps that are aligned w/ what i need, so not having the Android store, is not even close to a show stopper for me.  With my iPhone, the Apple store, in retrospect was useful, i did download/install way more crap than i needed or used.  I've learned to moderate and keep apps/software i install on all of my PC and device platforms to what's really useful & needed, even if the app is for pure entertainment or recreational value.  Keeping my machines 'clean' helped w/ overall maintenance, security, and performance.<br/><br/>My carrier for decades has been Cingular and AT&T; so there's no issue w/ them being the sole carrier - besides they have a wireless network w/ more coverage than most and from what technical articles I've read, the only true 4G/LTE specs & performance at the moment. Since i was eligible for an AT&T; phone upgrade, I opted for the 18-month AT&T; Next installment plan upgrade, which costs sales tax upfront and about $30/mo.  I have a grandfathered AT&T; data unlimited plan for my iphone which i chose not to opt out of so i carried this forward. I have another AT&T; phone line for laptop data unlimited which i will convert to a Mobile Share Value Plan w/ a MiFi AT&T; Unity Pro) for other laptops & devices when mobile/traveling - I haven't committed to the tradeoffs on this one yet - unlimited data is hard to give up for metered usage plans.<br/><br/>The Fire Phone doesn't run hot and isn't uncomfortably warm to hold when I'm either on the phone or skype cam for long periods, like some of my friends & family w/ Androids incessantly complain about.<br/><br/>It's a great successor to my iPhone 4 w/ 32GB - I won't be looking into the iPhone 6 when it comes in - I did factor the advent of the iPhone 6  into my buying decision and am totally satisfied.  I'm anticipating that updates will make the device even better for my needs than it already is.<br/><br/>I sync the Fire Phone  (and my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9) to my master database on my Windows Outlook calendar & contacts; I've been using Outlook since it beta'd so my calendar & contacts have evolved with me and is precious data.  It easily sync'd my email for multiple accounts on various portals (gmail for both google personal & google business, Hotmail/EAS/Exchange, private/hosted SMTP servers) using POP3 and/or IMAP.  Much easier than my new Macbook Pro 13.1" Retina is faring regarding sync - I'm struggling w/ Apple v. Microsoft's non-interoperability (sync'ing Outlook calendar & contacts) a bit and just subscribed to Exchange Online to hopefully solve this; perhaps this will also be of further benefit to the Fire Phone - we'll see, altho the Fire Phone doesn't need further 'help' sync'ing email, calendar, or contacts.<br/><br/>The Fire Phone voice phone quality is better than my iPhone - more clarity, higher signal/noise ratio, better voice quality and intelligibility.  After all, it wouldn't be much good if it weren't, as it is a phone. I have mobile devices & computers that are better suited to other activities benefiting from more power, a regular keyboard, and larger or multiple viewing displays.<br/><br/>It fits in my hand and is suited to one-handed usage as per design - this is a big plus as more than half the time in use i hold it and can navigate much of it w/ one hand. More apps supporting the new gestures and movements will just improve the user experience - but these features aren't mission-critical, they're value-adds - so the adoption curve will take care of proliferating new feature support in due time.<br/><br/>I kept my iPhone 4 for more than 3 years.. I can see using the Fire Phone for at least 2.. Time will tell how the Fire Phone evolves; I can only see it getting better and for me it's better than my iPhone 4 for starters so it's looking up from my usage pattern, vantage point & perspective.
I am severely disappointed with this phone. I've had a markedly different experience with the Fire than some of the reviewers here, and am not at all impressed with Amazon's flash-over-substance approach to this device. In short: the Fire is not a good phone.<br/><br/>First off, let's get real: Dynamic Perspective is a gimmick that adds no value unless you are interested in nothing more than showing off a neat optical illusion. Firefly works fairly well but is integrated so tightly into Amazon's sales system that it is actually just a sales-baiting version of what other apps on other platforms (like the Amazon app on the iPhone!) already do. As for the rest of the phone, the Fire's interface is inelegant and fails more often than it works, native apps constantly crash for seemingly no reason, and the voice command system has pretty much one pathetic response: "I'm sorry, I can't do that yet." Put a screen protector on, I dare you, and your interface problems get even worse.<br/><br/>The phone does have a couple of quality features; the camera is good and the speakers are actually the nicest I've ever encountered on a smart phone. The problem is, they are attached to a device that constantly makes you feel like you've paid your hard-earned money to be a beta tester for Amazon. I'm not an Amazon hater by any means, either - I gave this phone a chance because I thought it would be a great alternative to a new iPhone and I love the Prime Video/Music "ecosystem." It was a poor decision that I've come to regret.<br/><br/>I'm really glad there are a few folks out there who seem to like this phone a lot, but I'm sorry to say I'm not one of them.
If there was a negative stars option... that's what this phone would get. Every video looks great on my phone. And ONLY ON MY PHONE. Good luck trying to share, it will look like you took it on your grandmother's phone from 1990. Pixelated and grainy. I tried to send a video of my son riding his bike for the first-time without training wheels to his grandparents. "Is that a kid on a bike? I can't tell." Thanks for ruining such a special moment. This phone is ridiculous. Buggy. A waste of money. I'll be switching back to Apple now. Learned that lesson the hard way. Additional issues:<br/>Randomly the keyboard disappears when trying to send texts. Must turn off and on to get it back.<br/>The lock screen will go black several times in a row when trying to unlock it.<br/>Pictures are grainy when sent.<br/>Can't connect to Google Play.
I have loved this phone from the time I opened the box. Yes there have been a few things I have found out that Amazon doesn't do and yes need to fix.<br/>A few of the apps I was wanting they don't have<br/>How there is so many steps involved to do a lot of things.<br/>I can't make folders for all my apps.<br/><br/>But there is so much more I love about it.<br/>The free year of prime.<br/>The task manager  (carousel)<br/>The MayDay is a creat feature.<br/>Firefly is so neat.  Love how its not just for music like Sound Hound.<br/><br/>Bottom line this phone being a first generation needs some work and I'm sure it'll be fixed in the next one just like Amazon did with the Kindles
Like the phone quite well. Like being able to scroll up or down a list without dragging my finger up and down the screen. Also left and right side panels to each screen with the flip of the wrist.  The 3D screen saver that changes everyday to a different scene. Sound quality of the phone very good, and voice command works great. Really large storage capacity compared to other phone. Overall feel and appearance of phone is that of good quality. The camera on the phone takes better pictures than any previously owned smartphone. Also protective cases for the fire phone are less expensive than other phones I have owned and are very good quality.
Pros: Amazon Cloud at your fingertips. I highly recommend this phone for Kindle Fire/Prime users. The apps/music are already waiting for download and use. Current contracts will be extended by a year (which makes the phone an even better deal) The dynamic movement or perspective has a tricky learning curve and the tutorial from the AT&T; was a lifesaver. I honestly thought I'd just turn it off to save battery life, but when the screen scrolled down automatically when I was reading in the browser, I had an ah-ha moment that was "nerdy" cool. Amazon pioneered the cloud feature so it's seemless. Although I consider myself an Amazon superuser, I bought the firephone only because my Samsung galaxy 3 screen was dying. I wanted the next iphone but without any official word on the Apple release date, I was too afraid of buying the 5s now. After having the 12&3 galaxy, I was ready for change. My review is unbiased. And oh the display and camera are top of the line. Better than my ipad. I like that its thick; I think I can hold on to it better this way.<br/>Cons: App development. Emojis. Even Samsung has upgraded so emojis can be seen in color lol.I was happy to see an instagram app but highly disappointed not to see groupme or snapchat. I hope developers recognize the potential of growth and the market grows. I dont like recent info showing from messaging and calls on the carousel. I kinda want to show off my device without revealing that private information but at the same time keep the shortcut. Right now I just remove from carousel.I haven't discovered how to customize the sequence of apps on the carousel or if that's an option. The stock messaging app is very basic. The phone is glass front and back. Gets hot after long use. Finally this is model number one. It's a risk because long term we just don't know how substantial the hardware is. I think most of my other "cons" can be resolved with software updates.<br/>Update 9/19/14: Now that more than a month has passed,the bugs have came out. The lock screen changes regardless of how many times I select my photo and the option to never change. The price drop so soon definitely hurt loyal Amazon customers who bought the phone within a week of the release! I could have renewed my 2 year contract and not be paying an extra $20 on my bill every month. The smartphone features are still superb but the basic phone features are lacking. The recent call list needs to be divided into received, made & missed; I had missed a call and never knew until days later. Built in blocking capability would be nice (there is an app for it but still). My new music doesn't show up under the music app as being on my device (I actually made the purchase from the music app) but instead I had to find it under prime music and then actually use the silk browser to download it to the phone. My biggest concern is why my screen doesn't stay shut off when plugged in? I wake up to find the screen dimly lit and the phone hot :/ this constant heating cannot be good for the long run. Looking forward to an update that uses more of the Android capabilities for personalization.
This device is incredible. Everything you could possibly need or want in a phone is wrapped up in this nice little bundle.
I had all almost all the new iphones and can't say that I wasn't happy with them but I saw and played with the fire phone and was impressed!!<br/>I purchased the phone and am very happy and I don't work for or am getting paid by amazon!!! but the phone is heavy feels good in the hand the screen size is perfect the video is crisp and clear the camera is nice and it is fast.<br/>The live tech support is fantastic and they listen to you if you have an issue they actually past it thru to the designers to address the problem and really call you back to follow up!!!<br/>Love this phone don't know why they are giving it such a bad wrap!!!
My wife and I recently got new Fire phones on the same day. We both needed new phones and went with the two year contract so it was a good price! We were a little apprehensive with the mixed reviews out there, but we've had them a few weeks now and love them! We shop on Amazon fairly frequently and have quite a music collection. We also have Kindle and Kindle Fire. This is the first time we are Prime customers, and that has been a pleasant experience. It is great to have all that sync together on our phones, other devices, TV, and online! It is also neat that we can see each other's photos in the cloud. The phone itself is stylish and sleek. So far no problems at all. As it is now, great purchase!
Great phone and so easy to use.  I love that many of the commands are the same as my Kindle Fire.  Way to go Amazon!
I bought this phone recently, but returned to AT&T; a few days later, Sorry Amazon, it's just NOT for me!<br/>Although there have been more lengthier and well described reviews on it, I can just say what I do and don't like.<br/>I do like the 3D graphics, that's cool, and Mayday; sure is nice to talk to someone right away! I love Monkey Buddy, I'll miss it, it's fun!<br/>I DON'T like that the apps are separate from the screen saver (wallpaper, or as they call it lock screen scene). I LIKE dragging apps onto the wallpaper and having a pretty picture open up WITH the apps, I just DON'T like having no wallpaper at all, and you can't  have that cool 3D screen scene and the apps together with this phone. The 3D lock screen scene is only on for a short while, what's the use of that!<br/>The other thing about it I definitely don't like IS the text messages. I DO NOT like how small it is, and I don't have a choice of how big I want it because there is only one size, SMALL, especially for my eyes! I know they told me I could tap the screen three times to enlarge it, but then it's too big and goes out of the phone unless you flip it vertically; who wants to be doing that constantly!<br/>I know this phone is a bit on the heavier side, but that doesn't bother me. Camera was great, never took videos BUT all in all, NOT my type! When I took it back to AT&T; I traded it for a LG G2, and now it's love at first use, LOL :))).
Shutup environmentalists
I wanted to believe in this phone as I am a Amazon guy.  I have a dozen Kindles, 3 Fire TVs, Cloud drive subscription, tons of movies and music and order almost exclusively from Amazon so when I heard about this phone I ordered two immediately, one for myself and one for my 18 year old daughter.  It could not have been a bigger disaster than it was. One of the phones would not even charge and only turned on when you had power plugged into it.  The second the battery life was in minutes.  We had tried to activate the phone that would charge but never got through the process with ATT for some reason and finally gave up. Bottom line the phones were not ready for prime time; hopefully then got better by now.  Then the next mess occurred when we tried to return them; my mistake was putting both phones in the same box.  They only credited me for one phone and seem to have lost the second.  Sorry but this is my first return ever to Amazon and it did not make sense that you need to separate each item, and honestly I did not know which phone is which, as there was little to relate the individual phones to the specific orders, but I assumed they could count and put both return form labels in and on the box.<br/><br/>Live and learn, as I was paying full price for the two phones at $700 each it was a hard lesson to learn and I doubt I will ever see my money back.  I will never buy and expensive electronics item from Amazon again....
i rarely write reviews, although i am a die hard amazon customer. this review is intended for those of you who have not yet made the smart phone leap of faith...do it with the fire phone!<br/>i have literally, as of two days ago, traded in my prepaid samsung for a fire phone. i am a very happy camper. although i am considered late to the smartphone party, waiting for the firephone was the right choice for me. as a kindle hdx user, the learning curve was nonexistent. to have all of my content, books, music, contacts, apps, photos,etc., instantly on my phone, without having to do, literally anything, was heaven. navigation through the features is very easy, and if you need help, mayday is at your fingertips. it simply does not get any easier.<br/>you can read  about specs and technical stuff from the reviewers who know about this stuff. i can tell you that the ease of use, clarity of the sound and voice, as well as screen and camera is outstanding, from my perspective, at least.<br/>the only negative, which has been noted by others, is that the battery time seems short, so keep a charger handy.<br/>if you are considering a smartphone, for the first time, or trading in, consider the firephone first. user friendly in all reard, and amazon products have not disappointed this reviewer yet!
I love this phone it's amazing!!!! I wanted a kindle fire but then my other phone broke so I got this....
Works great and can't beat the price with Prime. Nice interface that's easy to navigate. Good number of apps but could use more. Silk browser is so-so. Camera is very basic. Firefly works well, but isn't all that useful. Nice to identify a song you hear but other than that? The tilt, swivel and peek features work well, especially the swivel which gives you context sensitive menus. Dynamic perspective is cute but not really useful. It's well made with a solid feel, but I went for the Supcase Unicorn Beetle Pro protective case which fit's like a glove.
It is the worst phone I have used. Sometime it could not receive a call without any sign though its signal bar are full. I need power cycle it then it works.<br/>In some wifi site, others brand phone could find certain wifi signal,however this phone cannot. I fell its wifi does not include certain frequency of wifi.<br/>Third, the phone likes to stuck when i try to receive a call when i browsing website. When it happen, i need power cycle it.<br/>It is the worst phone since its mobile function is not work as normal. It is a nightmare for me.
I really like the lockscreen if this camera. Every day I receive different lockscreens and everyone always is asking to see the latest one. The battery for this phone is very good compared to my iPhone 4 and Nokia 1020. I can easily go 2 to 3 days without charging. All the apps that I run are there and the browser is compatible and very fast to connect to any site that I use. The phone does not run hot and so far has a better reception than my Nokia 1020. I make most of my purchases over Amazon.com and the Firefly works perfectly.
Ok first off, i may be biased because i am a huge amazon user. I bought this phone when it came out and have been using it since. I have owned just about every iphone and a couple of the galaxies, i am no expert, but this has been my favorite so far. I was excited to see the phone but hesitant to buy it, worried the "gimmicks" would loose their luster. However, now having the phone i really enjoy dynamic perspective and the gesture controls, it's nice to have something NEW and DIFFERENT. As far as performance it is solid, and i have plenty of APPs to keep busy with. I really wish it had YouTube. There is a learning curve/break-in period to get used to the new format but once you get it down you'll be cruisin. ONE thing Autoscroll is not in Kindle app (yet) and that is disappointing. I do enjoy Firefly it works to identify Characters/actors, Scenes, Music, episode, and IMDB for movies. Works for music too, like shazam. Firefly is also great for scanning phone number emails and whatnot, AND of course buying things. So far i have had no crashes and no serisous complaints and i barely put the phone down. OH yeah the camera is pretty good, it takes a while to focus but having a designated button is nice and it takes nice photos.
I really love this phone! If you know how to use a kindle it's pretty easy to work.Took me a little bit to figure out how to customize my lock screen but it was not to hard to find. Overall the phone is wonderful, It's fast, pretty easy to work and I love that I have all of my amazon stuff right here on my phone. The only thing I did not like was the lack of apps, it seems all there are is kid apps. I'd like to see more run tracker apps also as I used runkeeper a lot on my other phone and I really it for mapping my runs.<br/><br/>Edit: I've had this phone for a year now and it worked amazing at first. Now it's freezing and slowing down real slow and i don't even have that much on the phone it's all on the cloud. I won't be keeping the phone I'll be going back to Samsung as soon as they let me get a new phone.  The only thing this phone has going for it is Firefly and the camera works amazing but that's about it. It dose not even have the newer apps like the google play store.
I absolutely love this phone. Granted, I've never owned an iPhone, but this is light-years ahead of my last two Samsungs! The photo quality is great! It's user friendly and syncs with my Kindle Fire. So I can read the book that I've been reading on my Kindle even when I'm somewhere waiting unexpectedly. I've downloaded virus protection for it, and I'm sure there's tons of apps out there that I'd enjoy. But I mostly use a phone for calls, texting, pics, and occasionally using the internet. So it's perfect for me!
First, let me say I'm a huge fan of Amazon. But, this phone has quite a few glitches. The most irritating thing is that settings seem to reset themselves all on their own on both my husband's and my phone. For example, I linked my Facebook to my contact list. It unlinks itself on a regular basis. Also, the lock screen doesn't stay on the one you selected. It seems to randomly give you a different screen. Not huge issues, but irritating glitches. I think it could be a great phone once all the bugs are worked out.
What can I say 99 cents for a smartphone it's a no brainer !!! There is a tinny sound with music but not if using a Bluetooth speaker and when streaming videos it does crackle a little but I don't use a phone to watch video. Super fast easy to use some very kewl functions ie: just turn the phone to bring on an accessory screen and it's just tried into Amazon so very well as well as Google . Awesome pictures and easy to use as well. If one has Amazon Prime it's music video and books all for about 80 bucks a year.
The only major drawback is the battery life. It is a bit sluggish. And, yes, the communication apps, especially to visual voice mail, are quite lackluster and confusing. Yet, I have gotten exactly what I wanted: a hand held kindle and a telephone. While I cannot wait for the evolution of this device, I am pleased that I per-ordered this phone. I am a prime member and fully immersed in the "Amazon Eco-system".  This phone is great for all the content I have with Amazon and meets my communication needs.
I love my Fire phone and made sure I used it for over a month before writing a review. I use apps from Google and have access to features that I had on my Samsung Galaxy. The battery life is excellent and device heat is not a problem as some reviews indicated. It has been very dependible and I have never had it "freeze" which is more than I can say for my Galaxy. My only wish is that the telephone calling features were broader. I added an App to block some numbers but wish that was a standard option.
When I went to the phone store today I was torn between getting an iPhone and this phone. We have been trying to get away from Apple technoIogy but had recently had a nightmare experience with the LG cheapo phone we had bought and had gone back to the store to begrudgingly go back to the iPhone, but since I love my Kindle and Amazon service, I decided to give this phone a shot. I am by no means a technology guru and have only had this phone since earlier today, but I will say that so far I absolutely love everything about this phone. I am already a prime member and kindle fire owner so found the learning curve was super easy. I love the design layout with having the carousel like the fire. I also like the quick getting started tutorial. And as an added bonus, a year free of prime membership. I was already a member and so an email was sent letting me know my year was extended.<br/>As for the phone itself, it is fast, sturdy, not too big, not too small, just right. The phone calls are clear, and I have not had any problems with any apps. I am more pleased with this phone than I thought I would be.<br/>The biggest downfall for me is that shopping is now SO easy!!!!!
Love it just as I love my kindle fire HD.  Very easy to use if your a fan of kindle and Amazon.
It's not that I don't like it. I LOVE what it is TRYING to be!  But the WiFi keeps going in and out whereas<br/>my other AT&T; phone does fine. So I canceled my AT&T; service plan and the rep even agreed that the Fire Phone<br/>had been rolled out before it was ready to go live. So we cancelled the plan.<br/>Now Amazon says if I don't re-sign up for the plan they will charge me $400.<br/><br/>So they may be a miserable service with nowhere to complain. But I'll eat the $400 if it<br/>gets them off my back(time is money, too). Some people might not as sanguine.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you sign up for the plan and your phone doesn't work, you cannot cancel the phone.<br/><br/>Note. I did everything they suggest on tech support(please, don't make me laugh), had called tech support<br/>early on and they were sorry they couldn't do much. So, "We're sorry we can't fix it and we're<br/>charging you $400 and there's no on you can complain too.And maybe they won't even print this..<br/><br/>But I love the phone so much I'm keeping it to use on WiFi. So there is this hidden cost of $400, I'm noting.
Excellent. I also have an iPhone 5s and before that an iPhone 4s. I have had a couple of Drood based tablets as well. The Fire seems to incorporate the best of iOS and Droid interfaces. Most iPhone shortcuts work in a similar fashion.<br/><br/>The setup could not have been easier. My Amazon account login brought over all my music, videos, and games that I had on my tablet.<br/><br/>I love the lock screen scenes.  I have it set to rotate every hour and the scenes are beautiful.
I have a first gen Kindle Fire, so I knew what to expect as far as apps and games. Yes, you don't have all the apps available to you that are on Android and Apple, but its to be expected since it is Amazon's first phone. Being the first phone that they have developed I think they went above and beyond expectations. I really hope they come out with a new phone next year, I upgraded to the Next plan and gave up unlimited data to have this phone. And not the least bit disappointed.
I like the phone a lot, and also the battery life is greatly improved because of the new update. That is another reason why I like this phone, amazon will continue to enhance this phones capabilities through constant updates, amazon cares about its customers. I also really like the features on this phone like dynamic perspective and firefly. I gave it 4 stars because the app store lacks some apps I really like on the iphone, but I like the amazon phone over my old iphone 4s.
I this phone because I was interested in the features and the amount of storage on it.  I am so tired of putting things on my phone and finding out that I have remove something else or move it or whatever so that I can use the newest thing.  THIS SOMETIMES happened even when I was trying to do and up date.  The only thing I am not happy about is that I lost my Google Play programs, but I can live with that in hope that sometime in soon Amazon will make these things avaible
I really didn't think I would love this phone as much as I do. The main functions that I use it for (picture, video, Instagram, & text messaging) are all flawless. The 3D design is tons of fun and makes the map tools easy and cool to use.<br/><br/>The main adjustment that comes with this system (I previously had an IPhone) is the carousel feature which is the equivalent to double tapping your home button on the IPhone to see your recently opened apps.
soooo sad this is discontinued.  i have a Samsung galaxy for work and the Fire phone is by far a more pleasant experience.  I don't want to have to have accounts with every big company like Google or Apple.  It is nice to have the Fire phone and a Kindle and keep all my stuff in one place.  The phone part and camera are as good as anything else and the Firefly is a cool trick that i used more than a few times while in the aisles of a store.
The “it’s a new tech toy” and I have to own it never grows old for me even in my senior discount years. No discount on the phone except for a year of Prime which I gladly accepted! Short answer I am adjusting to being without my beloved iPhone 5 and have moved on to a new love the Amazon Fire Phone. Amazon customers already owning the Fire HDX will open the box and feel like they have a smaller version of the Fire HDX when they see the home screen. The Fire Phone is entertainment in the palm of your hand. Sometimes as an early adopter I get a little crazed during the learning curve but when all else fails I am able to call “Mayday” and all is right with the world.<br/><br/>I am still slowly working through getting used to using the phone and accepting that I cannot be an expert overnight and maybe never. I did feel a little comfortable when I opened the box and turned on the Fire Phone as the home screen looks like the Fire HDX except for the cool new features. I love that many of the features such as the Carousel gives additional options such as when the app is on the Carousel you can look beneath it and see what you looked at last within that app. This was super when I went back and forth in the Search and Fire apps these past two days. I spent time going through all of the settings and turning on/off my preferences and adjusting my fonts etc. Somethings I could not immediately find what I was looking for but once I read through the longer version of help I was able to find the solution.<br/><br/>My precious books were waiting as soon as I activated my phone. Sadly some of my Amazon HDX apps did not make the trip across.  When I emailed Amazon they said they are working on app availability for the Fire Phone. I believe this to be a work in progress as the same thing happened when I moved from the Fire to the Fire HX but seriously I have to have the real Scrabble and not that other word game like Scrabble on my phone. My Prime Music took manual downloading instead of appearing automatically so that took a bit. I was surprised there could not have been an instant button to download to the device to save time. I did notice the battery running down faster than the battery on my iPhone. Lucky for me I have external batteries I take in my handbag when I will not be in the car or able to plug and charge.<br/><br/>Casual thoughts:<br/><br/>Verbal commands for messaging and email work great and the Fire Phone understood me without me having to repeat twice.<br/><br/>Email is a dream with quick response time and seamlessly putting frequently used names or contacts in the “to box”.<br/><br/>Map program is fine for directions and gave me extras when I moved the phone around (I did this when I was seated in the house not while driving).<br/><br/>Bluetooth works great and smoothly. My husband had to help with the pairing when I hooked the Fire Phone to my external speaker system in the kitchen since it would recognize the phone initially. The sound was great (we even took a twirl around the room)<br/><br/>The camera app took a great picture of one of my cats which I added to my home screen. I used the tools that came with the camera to enhance, crop etc. I did not need an additional app to edit. Most of all taking pictures is so easy! Speaking of pictures when you add cards to the Wallet app you can take pictures of the front and backs of the cards along with scanning the numbers.<br/><br/>I was happy to see my monthly issue of a magazine this morning on my Fire Phone but I needed assistance to enlarge the view and read sections of the magazine. With Mayday’s help all is fine again—thanks Caleb! He stayed on the phone let me practice with him to ensure I could enlarge and decrease the area I was reading. Three taps...not just fingers.<br/><br/>I ordered something from the Amazon store…no surprise there and also ordered something from an email attachment with ease.<br/><br/>Firefly recognized one item but not another by picture only. Firefly did fine as a QR reader.<br/><br/>I love all of the new features but my favorite new friend is the Monkey Buddy. Yep he keeps taking my picture and throwing it at me but sometimes he draws a heart around it. When he is nice he gets extra pets and a banana. He is a great way to become comfortable with using the phone’s features. Smart idea Amazon :)<br/><br/>Keep in mind this is version one of the phone and if you are fine being an early adopter in an ecosystem you already know and enjoy the Fire Phone is a nice addition to your Fire and Kindle family.
The idea of having a great company like Amazon endorse a phone was awesome, this phone has many good features but the product is horrible. My phone was not able to make outgoing calls and I called support and they performed their troubleshoot for close to an hour and told me their "specialist" will look into it and they will contact me in 3 days. I CAN'T MAKE OUTGOING CALLS! HOW CAN I USE THE PHONE? HORRIBLE!!
Excellent product,  Battery life is dependent on how many features you chose to use. The customer support is great. Quality is awesome and its fun to use. Phone and text are working wonderful.I do not use this phone for business, I use it to for shopping and fun.  I still use my iPhone for many of my banking and business needs simply because the amazon applications have not been developed by my banks systems yet.
So far (a couple of weeks) I like it more and more ... a good trend!  At first it seemed a bit of a disappointment, not particularly flashy looking or fast, but now I find it to be very appealing ... I love the aspect ratio (H x W) and the heft of this thing ... and the firefly feature (especially when it listens to my TV and gives me details) ... I also like the motion-activation features.  One feature that doesn't appear to be discussed on Amazon (a search of comments found only one) or mentioned anywhere in the Amazon page on the phone is the Siri-like, Go Google-like feature of the front button ... if you press and hold the button it'll prompt you to say something like "Call Penelope" or "Find a local Indian restaurant" ... very cool!<br/><br/>I do worry a bit about how warm it gets ... nothing kills electronics better than heat!
Love this phone I find it a lot easier to navigate compared to the iPhone.
love this phone. have had no issues and the battery life is fine . a lot of reviews claim the battery is poor. agreed if u want to play a lot with apps and games. this is a phone not a arcade device. had to use the mayday once and was very impressed  by Amanda. she did a outstanding job solving the minor issue. as the commercial its like nothing i have ever seen before. highly recommended it.
I just got it. I am not too impressed with firefly, Dynamic Perspective is cool, but doesn't apply to most of what I do on the phone, and Mayday isn't so great. (wait time, hit or miss with good rep)<br/><br/>So, why do I still give it 4 stars?<br/><br/>Unlimited photo storage<br/>year of free prime<br/>great resolution/image/screen/camera<br/>love easy shopping<br/>great for my mp3 itunes and amazon music and cloud-easy as an ipod<br/>I feel unique..not many people have it, so I like it<br/>the price is fine in comparison to other phones with this memory and features<br/>battery life is not the best, but it isn't an issue with me<br/>all the aps I want are on it, so that isn't a drawback either<br/><br/>The only way I'll be upset is if it doesn't last  3 years... then it won't be worth it...<br/><br/>bottom line, if you LOVE Amazon, it is a MUST BUY
I really like the Amazon Fire Phone. It looks very nice, and the photos are sharp and clear. The camera is easy to use, as is the Firefly feature. It is a very user-friendly phone. I showed the phone to my parents when I went to visit, and they both ordered one for themselves. I only had to use MayDay once, and they solved the issue immediately. I definitely recommend this phone to others.
I had to do some fast talking to get my AT & T rep to let me replace my I-Phone with the Fire phone as my contract was not up.  I wish he had not let me.  I am so disappointed in it.  I love the dynamic perspective but that is about all the phone has going for it.  I am an app user and almost all of the apps I had on my I-Phone I can no longer use.  Many of the android apps are incompatible.  When I find one it will tell me "downloading soon" and it never downloads.  So far Mayday hasn't been helpful in figuring out why.  I can no longer bank with my phone, check in at hotels or shop at a major warehouse store.  I can shop at Amazon.  While I have ordered 50+ times in the last 6 months I haven't ordered anything from Amazon since the Fire Phone debacle.  Can't wait until I can trade it in.
The phone is amazing for any individual willing to take a risk and experience something different. I suppose I can understand the dissapointment of those who felt the phone lacked stabilty, speed, and battery life. Issues such as these could discourage any user however walking away from this product based primarily on software issues that with time will not only be improved, but with amazon I believe our expectations exceeded alongside such fixed issues displays a lack of patience and dedication to product. I've owned the iphone 5s, LG G3, HTC One M8, HTC Windows phone, I've even had a few samsung phones. Yet ive never been this impressed. I cant say I believe this phone will take the world by storm oh so quickly but I do believe it's a perfect fit for those who have literally tried everything and found little satisfaction. The free prime membership is a definate bonus and being able to plug into amazons key features is fantastic. Location services and browsing capabilty need clear improvement. My search engines simply arent doing what they could be. However I love the phones ability to be powered by yahoo, google, or bing. The ease of use is really great plus there can be little to no button use if you choose. Amazing camera quality though a little glitchy thus the phone occasionally runs slow. However with confirmed updates being released by the end of the month to fix such glitches and improve battery life i'm not worried. Voice command.. Eh. To conclude. This phone is brand new. Perfection of its system and capability will take time. My advice? Stick with this phone. I assure you amazon has innovative, cutting edge monster like technology on its hands. The Kindle wasnt introduced to rave reviews but look at it now and before the fire phone I wasnt an amazon customer or fan. Ive found my product. Theres simply nothing like it and as it evolves nothing ever will be.
Everything at your fingertips
Love my fire phone😃 I got the 64 GB and my battery lasts longer than my last phone, an LG optimus. It's like having my kindle with me but better because it's also a phone now! The picture quality is amazing. Love my phone so I don't mind the 2 yr AT&T; contract. It's worth it. If u love your kindle you will love this phone. All my ebooks and games are on it. Joy!
Love this phone.  For internet, text, photos, and just general use,  lives up to all expectations.  Don't know what's up with all negative reviews?  App store has generally what you need if it's not there you probably did not need it anyway.  This is a cool phone with cool features.  If your a real nerd this is a phone for you. Just playing with features is fun.
Amazon services integrated into the phone are excellent, but that should be expected.  Screen is excellent @ 720p, I can't really tell the difference between 1080p or the 720p on the Fire phone, it's that good.  Screen is bright & colorful & I don't feel like I downgraded from my former Nokia 920 to this, in respect to size, screen, & weight.  The phone isn't heavy (unlike others have been saying) in the hand & that's an accomplishment, because of all the cameras & infrared sensors slapped on this thing.  The touch interface is zippy & doesn't seem to lag.  Options on the phone are simplistic & make using the phone a breeze.  Even if you're not an Amazon ecosystem person, this phone is relatively easy to learn, especially with the fantastic MayDay FREE service provided.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/><br/>Don't be turned off by the Amazon App Store!  You can get everything App you'd want by simply searching for an APK (file) on the Silk Browser.  You can actually download them directly to the phone & install them.  Some call this side-loading, but the way I did this, you don't have to plug the phone into a laptop with another Android device.  This is much simpler.  Download an APK file (App on Google Play Store) from "1 Mobile Market."  It's a Chinese version of the Google Play Store & has been around since 2009 or 2010.  Be careful with what apps you download from it though, it seems to want to take control of your Amazon Apps & replace them with 1 Mobile's versions.  I just don't update any of those & turn off App Installation from unknown sources, which you can easily do.  Just be careful what you download & be smart.  Also might not hurt to get an insurance plan with your carrier.  I spoke to AT&T; about this & they said if anything happens to the phone the insurance would cover it.<br/><br/>Now for the downside, the phone is almost unusable as a mobile device.  Especially with DP turned on.  I've gotten use to turning it off & just going with Low Motion which is an option that allows you to turn all the "goodies" off & use the phone just as a normal smartphone.  Don't get me wrong DP is awesome & the best 3D experience (gaming) created thus far.  But, it sucks battery life too much.  You won't even get a days use out of the phone even in moderate usage.  Having to continually keep the phone plugged in is ridiculous here in 2014 when most smartphones can go a day, day & a half or more on one charge.<br/><br/>The glass on the back is useless & needs to go on the next version if Amazon make another one.  It gets incredibly hot to the touch with DP on, turn it off & it's fine.  It only gets mildly warm using it just as a smartphone.  Battery life when everything is off is okay, it does last a bit longer but it's still worse than most options on the current market.<br/><br/>If you must have everything Amazon, beware, this phone is a 1st edition & they can certainly improve on this phone in a bunch of areas.  Cameras need to go, Firefly button is all but useless because of the App already installed.  The phone has too many physical buttons currently.  I would like to see the home/power button & volume rocker placed on the backside of the device with a rubber or matte finish.  The screen could also be enlarged to 5' or more with less bevel.<br/><br/>I gave the phone 3 stars instead of 2 because I do appreciate what Amazon tried to do, they just misfired on the package.<br/><br/>Thanks & I hope my review has been helpful to some.
I am a first time Smartphone owner/user. This phone does everything I want it to do.  I am able to make calls, receive texts and e-mails.  The phone seamlessly integrates with my kindle books and audiobooks.  While I have yet to use the "Firefly" feature for anything more than song identification I can see it as being beneficial down the line.
I love this phone, plain and simple. The latest update spared me nagging issues like poor battery life, overheating and no Emojis. The screen is crystal clear and just the right size and the price for a 64gb is crazy. The interface is great and I love the gesture controls. I say give this phone a chance. It had a rocky start but is working great now!
Great phone. Does everything my I phone did but better. Apps are cheaper and of good quality. I can share music with my friends. Firefly saves time typing. Even books and magazines are less expensive. Good gaming platform. Does all the things I wanted without added epense. Amazon prime was a nice touch
I love my fire phone so far. I do have some problems with it. 1. I can't seem to get ringtones for it :( 2. There are many apps I love that I can't get on my fire phone that I can get on my kindle like hulu plus and funimation free app 3. Phone gets a bit warm during use. Other than these things I have no problem with the new fire phone.
I have owned 2 iPhones & a Nokia Windows Phone and the Amazon Fire Phone is far the BEST!!!!! I would recommend this Phone to everyone!
I think this phone is great I love the camera. The battery life beats my iPhone 5. The only bad thing is that Apple is holding my phone number in some data base and I can't get group texts from Apple users. Getting my phone number released from Apple and getting texts from Apple users has been horrible. This is not Amazon's fault.
I am not very tech savvy but love my kindle.  The fire phone has the same format so  I didn't have to learn another device.  I also love being able to access all my kindle items via the phone.  This is my first smartphone and I looked at several, including my husband's samsung galaxy 4s, but this one seemed the easiest to use.
This, phone is amazing. I love it. It has so many features and it is fun to use and figure it all out. The mayday assistance is cool too. The live representative that helped me was so pleasant and helpful. The free year of Amazon prime is a huge perk. Ton of free content to stream. Very happy. Perfect size phone as well.
Probably not really helpful now that it is not available but will write a review anyway.<br/>- In short I like it. It is a great phone.<br/>- The user interface is really good, much easier to use than android. You just need to learn 4 gestures to access the left and right menus, the top quick access menu and the gesture for the back option. It is so easy that a newborn could learn it.<br/>- My life does not depend of any app, so I don't care you can't  install the google market or  whatever it is called. Most popular apps are available and, you can always manually install other apps.<br/>- I need to write about firefly, It is one of the best apps in this phone. You can identify movies, songs, products and, the best of all, you can just convert any text in a book, magazine, newspaper into pure  text. Just point your camera to the paragraph and... that is all. Copy the text to your article or homework and you are done. It can also read 1D and 2D bar codes.<br/>- the camera is great, I mean, It is 13MP what else can you ask. Some people, in any review, just say the colors are off or something like that. Maybe their eyes are really special or something but, cameras on most phones are good.<br/>- The screen is great too. No problems there, good resolution. In fact I do not see much difference with the lcd on my nokia N8. Cant understand why people complain about lcd resolutions. Beside the size, there is really not a single difference between the lcd on the N8, fire phone and Lumia 635, or any other phone with a higher resolution than the fire phone (unless your eyes are really special) .<br/>- The phone plays videos without problems. I have tried .mp4 and .avi and they play well. Nice video quality.<br/>- Dynamic perspective, I don't really find it that useful. I keep  it off to save battery.<br/>- One problem with this phone is that the battery is not so easily replaceable. Amazon does not seem to have batteries available either. It is a shame because with the hardware specs this phone is good for at least 5 years, probably more. When the time comes I will try to replace it because this should work fine for more than 5 years.<br/>- it is a shame that people is so easily manipulated by the media that this phone was pictured as trash. It is a great phone, looks and feel good quality, great hardware specs so yes, it is a shame. On the other hand, thanks to that I was able to get a great phone really cheap. There are no decent phones at a good price.<br/>- Maybe a bit big for me but, only big phones are available these days. The funny stuff is that when dell released the streak 5 everyone was saying it was too big, too cumbersome to use it as phone blah blah blah. Now people only buy 5 inches or more and they are happy. who can understand people? I can't.<br/>- One thing I wish more phones had is the lock/ unlock button used in the nokia N8. That is the best way to lock / unlock a phone. Manufacturers should look at those great solutions implemented in different phones and keep them. They are always reinventing the wheel for some reason.<br/>- I think many people are missing real keyboards but, they are gone. It is not like before, you had many options to choose from, clam shells, sliders, candy bar but now, it is just a bloody touchscreen. I am amazed they still use a physical power button. We need something like the nokia E7.<br/>- No phone is perfect but, this one is great. Just hoping I can replace the battery when the time comes.
The Fire Phone has gotten a lot better with it's new lock screens. I love dynamic perspective, and the maps app that comes with the phone looks really cool, with some of the buildings coming in color (like St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow, Russia). Steve Jobs hired liberal arts majors who knew something about computers, and apparently Amazon seems to have done the same with the maps app. Good job, Amazon!<br/><br/>FINALLY, Amazon has bent to the will of the public by allowing Google apps like Google Maps. I now have all the apps on my Fire phone that I have with my IPhone 6.<br/><br/>I bought my phone unlocked (another bending to the will of the public) and signed up with T-Mobile instead of AT&T.; If Amazon had allowed all these features from the beginning, I would have jumped the Apple ship a year ago.<br/><br/>The hell with iTunes and it's overpriced movies! I also got a year's subscription to Amazon Prime with the Fire phone, which has most of the same movies, and they are at least a dollar cheaper than iTunes, AND many of them come with X-ray, which allows notes to pop up on the left hand side of the screen that give trivial facts about each movie and actor.<br/><br/>The Fire Phone also comes with MayDay. I know that MayDay is just to help you with utilizing any hardware or android platform issues, but it would be nice if the staff had some knowledge of the basic, most popular apps too.<br/><br/>If I had any recommendations for a Fire Phone 2, I would have the phone be able to take dynamic perspective pictures and add them to the lock screens (maybe they already do - I need to talk to MayDay about this). I would also allow the Fire Phone to pair with the Samsung Gear S2, and amazing wearable that allows you to keep the phone at home. The maps app that comes with the Fire Phone needs to have a night time feature so that the screen turns dark (making it not so bright so that it doesn't strain your eyes) while you driving at night.
Let me just say that we own two of these phones, and I was planning on buying a third for my younger son in a year or so.  I absolutely LOVE this phone.  It works great.  It interfaces easily with our fire TV - I love that all my pictures flawlessly sinc and show up on all my amazon devices, including the fire tv.  I think the picture quality is awesome - could perform better in low lighting though.  I had no problem side-loading google playstore, which makes it hands down better than the iPhone.  Most of all, I loved that the unlocked version gave me the ability to use Walmart family plan.  Luckily coverage works well in my area.  Such an awesome screen, too.  I love watching videos and playing games on it.  The sound quality is great.  The interface took some getting used to, but I actually like it better - I am so used to swiping up from the bottom now to go back, that I find it "odd" to use a back button on my ipad.  This phone is quite literally a mini kindle with the ability to text and make calls - but the screen quality is the best ever so far on any device I've seen (have used Samsung tablets, nooks, kindles, and ipads).  Prime music is a great bonus, as well as access to the numerous books and videos.  The battery quality seems similar to many other smart phones - I have owned iphones and other android smart phones -  about the same as all of those.  Also, the parental controls, to me, appear to be the best out there on any smartphone in the extensive, frustrating research I did earlier this year.  (did a lot of researching in smart phones and ability to block internet, adult content, etc: - this phone actually was the best for that and really easy to do - researched samsung, iPhone (this is good too but more expensive for phone and phone plan than amazon), kajeet phones, windows phone, android phones with google) In all honesty, I think this phone was ahead of its time and not warmly embraced, because it's different.<br/><br/>From seeing the negative reviews, there are numerous complaints about not having google.  That actually can be side-loaded, no root required.  I searched for the way to do it on this website - in other customer reviews.  Perhaps, ideally, if the fire phone would just give everyone the basics they are used to in android smartphones (google apps) plus all their innovative technology (love the dynamic perspective and firefly is cool - perhaps expanded upon), this probably would be everyone's favorite, especially at an affordable price unlocked.  That way what we are used to can be combined with embracing the new.  Please amazon do no ditch this phone.  Love it and want to see a fire phone 2.
I don't usually write reviews but I wish to forewarn others before they are misled into buying this product by Amazon. The OS of FIre Phone is quite unusual but don't expect MAYDAY to "come to the rescue". After five calls  from this non-techie, Amazon blocked me from using it. However, the manual has no search function so if you're still getting stuck with a navigation problem... well too bad on you! You can always send an email to Customer Service and wait many, many, hours for a reply.<br/>As it happens, I used Bluetooth my first day with Fire Phone and sound quality on the other end was good. But when I tried to call without it the next day, I discovered that the microphone did not seem to be functioning correctly as no-one could hear me. All I heard was a loud echo of my own voice as I spoke. As Mayday had been blocked, I used email from the general Amazon site to contact customer support. After many hours of waiting, I was sent a written reply with two "fixes". They did not work.The email included a direct number to call in case I was still having a problem. It did not connect me directly with a customer rep However as I was directed to leave my number for a call back. Miraculously, I did receive the return call within minutes (finally I could get to speak with someone). The agent asked me some questions and then passed me to yet another department. There I was asked about my apps and when I informed that my I had downloaded Google Play (you see, I had done this dastardly deed in order  to compensate for the lack of simple things like a decent voice recorder - Amazon Apps remind me of Symbian and I think their app store will be just about as successful as Nokia's in its day)...WELL - I would have to remove it to get back the microphone he said. So I did as I was told, a complete factory reset that destroyed hours of work setting up this thing,  to no avail. Nope -  the problem is with the hardware (if you take a look at the Amazon Kindle blogs as I SHOULD have done, you will find that microphones are the weak link in Amazon products). So because there seems to be no quality control at the end of the production line,  I now have to send my phone back to Amazon to get a replacement. If it weren't for the money already spent, I'd have preferred throwing this Fire into the fire. I have always loved Amazon and find their service and pricing unbeatable. The FIre Phone, sadly, is very much an exception.
Nice-looking phone, syncs with your Amazon account, which is convenient. Takes decent photos. Dynamic perspective is gimmicky and not particularly useful, but fun. Can shop at the touch of a button, navigate with GPS, check various email accounts in a single inbox, stream videos and music, control your Fire TV (for Amazon videos, at least; not other apps), too name a few features... But rather glitchy.<br/><br/>I have GPS turned off for all applications except for maps. I had adjusted the settings in the main sins. I went to use my camera and noticed the triangular icon that indicates your locator is on. It flickered on, but went off, which made me question whether it was on our not. I had to fiddle with the settings by going directly into the camera app, turn the locator on, then turn it off. Then I no longer saw the triangular icon.<br/><br/>I use my phone for alarms. I have one set to ring Monday through Friday and I like to set the volume at the highest level. The alarm will ring nice and loud at first. But at some point, the volume drops to a lower setting without me changing it. I readjust and it'll happen again, invariably dropping to the same lower position.<br/><br/>The phone displays bubbles notifying you the number of text messages, emails, or phone calls you missed/voice messages you have. They typically disappear once you check your messages/calls. Sometimes they don't. I had a missed call. I went to the call log and exit out of the application. The bubble remains indicating I have a missed call. Or I see the bubble telling me I have text messages. I see alerts that I don't need to read and I delete without reading. The phone still says I have unread messages. Even when I read the message, the bubble remains. I have to restart the phone to get rid of the bubble notifications.<br/><br/>I've contacted Amazon for these problems. They can't explain then and their troubleshooting tricks are temporary fixes. They even had me back up my phone and reset to factory default settings. When I restored my data, not all my contacts were restored, but all of my text messages were.<br/><br/>Also regarding text messages, there is a search function, but it only searches the body of the message. It would be handy if it could also search sender/recipient.<br/><br/>Also, when I first got the phone, I connected it to my Wi-Fi. At first, it would reconnect automatically upon returning home. Now, I have to force it to connect. Strangely, it automatically connects to other Wi-Fi networks I set up. I was thinking it could be my home network that was the problem, except, all of the other devices (Amazon and other) instantly connect with no problems.<br/><br/>I've also had a problem with the ringer: turning it to silent, only to find the sound back on without my undoing.<br/><br/>Lastly, I sometimes can't unlock the phone. Pursuing the home key sometimes results in the screen blinking and slipping instantly back to sleep mode. This happens repeatedly until it finally works or when I reset it by depressing the top/power button. Sometimes it seems related to the angle with which I'm holding the phone.<br/><br/>The phone generally does what it needs to do and performs many tasks, but it also needs work. Given the bugs, it wasn't worth the $200 price tag. Hopefully, the developers well improve it soon based on all the feedback.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I think my issue with the volume may be attributed to an app I have downloaded on the phone. I have the app set to put the phone in energy-save mode when the battery reaches a certain point. Lowering the volume, it seems, helps save energy. That being said, I wish the volume controls were more easily accessible. The buttons on the side of the phone control the ringer and media volumes. But when does it control which? Good question. I find it's not consistent. Sometimes when on the home screen, it will change the ringer or the media. Sometimes when I'm trying to change the media volume, I end up adjusting the ringer. Alternatively, sometimes I wish I could access ringer volum and the media volume appears on screen. Then there's the issue of it would be helpful to allow the user to adjust the volume from the Quick Actions panel as you can do with the screen brightness.<br/><br/>And now a new issue: there's a ringer option to silence the phone for three hours, then it reverts to audible on its own. Previously, I would select this option and immediately see the counter count down. Now, it doesn't seem to count down. I'm not even sure if it turns off after three hours now.<br/><br/>One positive thing I have to say is my phone seems to not consume as much power as quickly as it did. I feel that the battery lasts longer when I use it for a variety of tasks, be they to surf the Internet, check email, play a game... Perhaps one of the updates pushed out to the phone addressed this issue, I don't know, but I'm happy that I don't feel compelled to bring my charger with me anymore!
I've been using the Amazon Fire Phone for about 90 days now, and am very pleased overall with the switch from the iPhone. On the plus side, the battery charges very quickly and maintains its charge well, the sound quality of calls is very good, and all of the pre-loaded apps (navigation, alarms, mail, texting, silk browser, access to Amazon, etc. work as advertised.). I am especially pleased with the camera's picture quality and that the images very quickly appear on my Kindle Fire HD. Firefly is very handy and works well! The app store isn't as extensive as Apple's, but it has everything I need, and if you have apps on your Kindle Fire, they load onto your phone with no hassle at all (as do your books) and you can pick and choose which apps to use on the handset as well as purchase apps specifically for the phone. Personally, I frequently use Pandora and Soma FM and the sound quality of the music through the headphones is terrific. I'd also like to compliment whoever designed the phone's packaging. My wife and I were very impressed with the simple, yet elegant box  the phone came in.<br/><br/>There are a couple of improvements I'd like to see made in a future software update. Firstly, I'd prefer that blocked numbers are simply stored somewhere in the phone's memory rather than in the contacts file. I'd also like those numbers to be completely rejected rather than automatically directed to voice mail. secondly, I would also like to see a native way to tether the phone to my Kindle Fire so that I can respond to and send texts while using the tablet. Currently I use the Tablet Talk app to work around this limitation, but it's often balky and I'd much rather see that capability built into the phone and its tablet cousin.<br/><br/>Overall, I am very satisfied with the Fire Phone and would recommend it to anyone, especially those who already use the Kindle tablet devices, and I'm looking forward to seeing what improvements Amazon makes to the phone in the future.
I picked up the Fire Phone about four days ago. It replaces an iPhone 4, which replaced a Samsung Galaxy, which replaced a Nokia e-62 (go ahead and look it up... I'll wait). Okay, if you are done laughing, here goes:<br/><br/>I was pretty excited to hear that Amazon was getting into the cell phone market, but I had a about a year left on my iPhone contract. No big deal. I waited to see what the reviews looked like a few months along. Once upon a time, I sold cell phones. One thing that you learn is that it is difficult to judge a new phone in the first 24-48 hours. Give it a few weeks and you will find all of the bugs and annoyances. So.... Thanks to everyone who took the plunge before me.<br/><br/>This is a standard and (so far) very reliable smart phone. I like the camera option that allows you to pick the best lighting for pictures. (It's almost like cheating.) The year of free Prime almost makes it all worth it. I already got the case with free shipping at a third of the price from AT&T.; (Pro-tip: phone cases wholesale around $3-$6.) It's also the right size. My old phones did not have a big enough display, but I didn't want a phone that might as well be a tablet. (I already have a Kindle.) The weekday and weekend alarm option is a nice little feature. The Firefly feature seems to work fine on QR codes, but it will also look at an item to see if it is available on Amazon.<br/><br/>To nitpick: I wish the books app would give you separate options to view the books stored on the device and the ones that only live in the Cloud. The phone is designed to push you toward buying stuff from Amazon, but that's not surprising since it is an Amazon product and all...<br/><br/>The biggest knock on the phone seems to be that the navigation is not "intuitive." I translate that to mean, "It doesn't work just like an iPhone." If you have a Kindle Fire, this works very similarly. You just have to play around with it a little bit. Use this for a few months and suddenly the iPhone navigation is not "intuitive." In fact the AT&T; sales rep was not ready to sell me the Fire until I explained that I also have a Kindle and I read all of the reviews. (It's funny how I didn't get the same reaction when I changed from the Samsung to the iPhone.)<br/><br/>In the end, this is a solid phone that doesn't offer anything "new." But ultimately, we have already created a device that puts the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy to shame. I would really like to know what else people expect us to cram into a "phone."
I told my boyfriend that I have found a new love-my new Amazon Fire Phone :) I'm loving my new phone I have not 1 complaint it holds a good charge for along time a lot of my other phones I'd be having to charge by mid-day after I already charged it that night before I went to bed &I; love the may-day feature if you need any help you click on it and you get a live person they can't see you but you can see them & they can actually go right threw your phone features while your on it with them and assist you with stuff and teach you & assist you with any features your not sure of or need help with or if the phone might be having any technical issues so I enjoy that perk & I got 12 months free Amazon Prime which gives you free movies & music for 1 year on Amazon Prime which  also gives you the free 2-day shipping choice on Amazon Prime Orders, so that was a nice gift because if you purchase Amazon Prime on your own it will cost you $100.00.It comes with a great, sharp looking hands-freeheads set with a great sound I use it to talk on while driving when I dont wanna use my Bluetooth +I even use it to listen to music from my phone + laptop+ what a great sound. The phone is easy to learn & I'm bad with new phones! I have had no bad issues thus far.. It is nice looking & has a great sound and takes a very nice picture & video.I'm loving all the neat features.. I have had a lot of different phones & this is by far my Favorite yet. FOLLOW UP; 2 months in with my Amazon Fire Phone and I do not like 2 things 1 is the app situation I wish I read the reviews shame on me lol but you can not get any apps on google play you now are stuck with only amazon apps store, now they do have many of the everyday apps such as facebook,ebay,twitter,instagram, but many are not avalable and some are similiar versions of what your looking for kinda like a knock off purse.. so do your research on what apps are a must have in your everyday life cause my bank is not on there or a few very good photo editing apps I like and now have only versions of them and some apps not even there and you can not use google play store no longer.. and I take back the battery life is great is not i is so so I have to charge my phone every single night and once in awhile another time during the day if I use it a little more but there are a lot of battery saving tips such as turn down screen brightness turn off or uninstall some pre-installed apps you do not use that yu can uninstall without hurting phone and download battery doctor or a silmilar app but I still like my new phone but I want to cheat on you when at 1st I only loved you!! :) will keep phone a year then gonna have to buy another this one comes free with signing up with ATT&t; service so if you switch to them and request this phone it is free and Prime comes free 1 year with all purchases of the Amazon Fire..
I find many features about the Amazon Fire Phone to be unique and an amazing first attempt at a phone. Firefly and the Dynamic Perspective are both interesting additions.<br/><br/>I'd like to point out that I have very in depth knowledge of Windows Phone, Android, and iOS. With that I understood before I even bought the phone that it would be a different experience altogether. Until recently I had never actually used a kindle, so I didn't know the type of environment that it possessed. Had I that knowledge I would have further assumed that this would drastically be a different experience altogether. For those who were looking for an Android phone and became emo because this was nothing like it, I say to them there has been enough documentation even before the phone came out that they should have known better. This is the Amazon ecosystem and not the google android.<br/><br/>On that note, the phone was not immediately intuitive to use. The side menus don't always respond. I will say that if your waving your phone around, of course it won't know when your trying to activate the menus by quickly tilting the phone. Yet if you move your phone to a new position, you'd need to wait just a second before you tilted it for the desired effect. With that I would say 80% of the time it responded.<br/><br/>The dynamic perspective feature is amazing. Many reviewers found it to be frivolous and without merit towards future apps. I believe that it has amazing potential. Especially when you consider what it could do with an rpg, first person shooter, or adventure game.<br/><br/>Firefly was a great concept, but one of the reasons I'm marking this down to 4 stars. The idea is that you can hover your camera over an object and the phone would be able to figure out what it was, or at the very least the servers, and you could find a product match online. 1 out of 10 times that worked for me. Pointing it directly at an iPhone 5c with a giant apple on the back of it was apparently not obvious enough.<br/><br/>Because of the unique features in the phone the battery life suffered immensely. Especially playing games that used dynamic perspective. I'd get just a couple hours of battery life out of it.<br/><br/>Interacting with the phone to navigate through previous apps wasn't at first intuitive. I can only assume I even now understand it correctly. Hitting the home button will take you to the main screen where you can scroll through the previous apps you had open. However it doesn't show a thumbnail of what you were lasting doing. So not as intuitive or friendly.<br/><br/>For gaming the market is extremely difficult to navigate and find the games you would like. More so than on the other app stores. I didn't find any category to sort through the various types such as RPG, adventure, puzzle, or whatever else there might be. So it became just a clutter.<br/><br/>I will update this review more once I have had further experience. Right now I've only had it for a week so we'll see how it goes.
I've been using the Fire Phone for a couple of months now, coming from a Motorola Android. Many of this phone's features are actually quite useful to me, despite a lot of reviewers being dismissive about them. The email and text preview and easy navigation saves me a ton of time as I go through the daily chore of work-related communication. It shows your newest emails and texts right on the home screen/carousel so you can quickly get up to speed on things and get things sorted - Nice. Also the FireOS to me seems very efficient - I was getting pretty frustrated with Android since it was getting more and more cluttered. This is a fresh approach and it makes recurring tasks easier to use. It's a fresh approach to a phone OS with some great merits although there is still room for improvement as one might expect.<br/>One feature I like and use a lot is Firefly. Whenever I want to (re-)order stuff on Amazon, I can just snap it and with a few clicks I'm done. No more getting to my PC, logging in, searching, etc - swift actions for things I need anyway so I might as well get them easy, fast and cheap on Amazon Prime right? Also, this feature is really good with music. I have had it recognize a ton of songs I did not know and otherwise would probably never know the title of. When you listen to a mix or hear a song you like on TV, you don't always get the title and artist. By the time you get Shazam doing anything, chances are the song is over. Firefly on the other hand is not only accurate, it's also fast. One button click and you're in.<br/><br/>The size of device also is just right to me - not too big, not too small, easy thumb navigation. Feels solid in my hand and well built.<br/><br/>I guess this phone only shows its usefulness if you use it and if you're the right kinda user. For one, without Prime, it's pretty much a dud. But for me, it works just right and it has made a lot of things I come to expect from a phone as a tool a lot easier.<br/><br/>The 2 things I thing are misses are (1) banning access to Google Play - that cuts you out of a lot of apps that can be useful and most people will have a few apps they really want. Thing is, they can be different for everyone so you need access to a big library. Doesn't look like Amazon will have that anytime soon so I need Google Play back. The other issue is (2) price - this should have been a $49.99 to $79.99 phone from the beginning. $199 was too much and $0.99 screams desperation and upsets people who paid $199 just a few weeks earlier. Amazon succeeded getting the price wrong twice on this product.<br/><br/>I really like the product and I hope Amazon will do what they usually do and that is to persist and disrupt - I want to see the next Fire Phone!
Went through AT&T; to get the phone. First mistake since the price dropped on Amazons to 99 cents.<br/><br/>Good<br/>1. Amazon Prime for a year.<br/>2. Large screen.<br/>3 Good camera.<br/>4. Identifies music accurately. (cool feature)<br/>5. Call quality is good.<br/>6. Music quality is good.<br/><br/>Bad<br/>1. Phone has decided to turn itself off a couple of times in 1 month of having it.<br/>2. It gets hot. Much hotter than any other phone I have had.<br/>3. The tilt feature is pretty cheesy. Just as an examples, in text messages you angle the phone to see the time stamp. It works some of the time. The space for the time-stamp is there whether you see it or not ... why do I need to angle the phone to see it? I've turned off this feature as I have found it more annoying then useful.<br/>4. Keyboard disappears sometimes and have to reboot the phone. Major phone deal breaker for me.<br/>5. Amazon store only for apps.<br/>6. Sorta goes with the Amazon store, Android version is not the same as the common market. Thus, can only get Amazon apps. Not what I expected.<br/>7. Transfer of information from old phone (iphone) wasn't too useful. It transferred contacts ... that's it.<br/><br/> Overall, I can't recommend this phone. If the hardware and software issues were fixed, It might be ok for you. The non-standard Android operating system really has me ticked off. I wanted to try android apps, not Kindle apps. I have 2 Kindles, I didn't need another Kindle. I usually trust Amazon and like their services, which is a big reason why I got this phone. This phone makes me rethink Amazon. I feel like they leaped before looking. And I leaped before looking in not waiting for reviews on this phone.<br/><br/>PS: One positive is that the Kindle apps I already have are available on the phone.
I recently got this phone. I got it as an early birthday present on August 21, 2014 and that was just 3 days ago and I love this phone. The prime benefits are awesome, certain books, music, movies/tv shows are all free! The phone itself is of course very nice too. I am a previous owner of an iphone 5S and have few complaints. I'll start with the Pros. This phone has a nice sized design and with 32gb it has plenty of storage for apps, games, books, movies, music and stuff. You can organize the apps on the home screen however you like which is very nice, dynamic perspective lets you get cool angles of your phone screen, free year of prime membership (enough said :-) ), and nice built in speakers. Cons since there are always going to be some, the version of Siri which is called voice input knows very very very few commands it only knows how to search the web, call someone or text/email someone, phone will become too hot to hold if you are on the phone for very long, firefly barely works so don't plan on it becoming your new faviorite app, missing some good apps I used to use a lot like, find my friends, liftmaster, shopkick, my school app (gpc), as well as some others that I'm sure I'll remember after I submit this comment, also 2 more cons are that when I'm reading a ebook while lying down it will change pages if I tilt the phone ever so slightly that now I have to bookmark the page I'm reading so I don't lose my place, and if you have contacts that have more than one number on them and you are switching phones like I did then first get the free app called at&t; connect to transfer over all your contacts, photos, etc. if it doesn't work and you are only concerned about your contacts because they are not in your gmail or whatever then you better be very patient and prepare for a couple of hours of putting all the additional phone numbers back in your contacts like I had to, yikes.<br/><br/>These are just a few things I liked and disliked about this phone but I would nonetheless recommend this phone to you and anyone else in the market for a phone as long as you are patient and are with at&t; because until amazon signs deals with verison, t-mobile and everyone else you are stuck with them.
I got tired of Apple and their shenanigans, so I switched to the Fire Phone.  I honestly do not understand what so many reviewers are complaining about!  The display is gorgeous.  The battery life is more than any phone I've had (turn off your dynamic).  The camera is great.<br/><br/>No,  there are not as many apps as on an Apple product, but surely, anyone switching from one to the other would expect that.  There is an organizing app that is free that creates file folders.  There's a generic YouTube app that had works great for me.  The biggies are there.<br/><br/>About the only thing that I don't like is the mapping system, but I didn't like Apple's either.  Google Maps rocks.
this is an awesome phone , I would recommend it to anyone.
So I bought this phone being a google play store fan. Yes it doesn't come with the play store but that wasn't an issue. Use apk4fun.com to get all my play store apps. The phone does get a warm but I've notice the more days I've had it the less warm it becomes, also it's not like a burn you hand hot. The battery seems to be getting better too. I'm thinking the first few days the phone is simply updating and configuring, therefore hotter and less battery the first couple days. I really enjoy this phone. The screen is beautiful to look at. Would recommend to anyone who is an experienced with computers (compared to someone with a basic knowledge of phone, Facebook, Twitter, ect,)
I was reading a lot of comments here for the phone. I realized that most of the comments are about the fact that amazon does not use clean energy. I want to read things about the phone and people experiece using the phone, not how amazon needs to use clean energy.<br/><br/>The phone is great, i love it and it still needs a lot of work for being the first gen of its kind. To start, Amazon needs to find a way to get Google APPS. second the start up speed of the phone is kind of slow and it needs to be faster and crispier. over all I like the phone for everything else i can do with it.
I am stunned at the sophisticated beauty of my roving, changeable screen...so "non-Disney"...soooooo...surprisingly refreshing...now I want Firefly...I think...your employees are so courteous!  I am a new fan of Amazon....and I am telling everybody about AmazonFire! Thanks for a top-notch product...
Absolutely love this phone.  I am still discovering all kinds of neat things I can do with it.  I love the firefly button and the mayday button.  I've used mayday for help and I've used the fire fly button to identify songs on the radio.  I've synced my calendar and like most smart phones can check the weather, my email, and log onto FB, or surf the web.  It's great!  And I have access to my cloud drive.  I can even view photos that I've taken with my Kindle Fire on my Fire phone.  And I can attach pictures to FB posts from my Kindle that I've taken with my Fire phone.  And I have access to thousands of Amazon and Kindle apps.  I am loving this phone.
I too was so excited to get this phone....I hate to say this, I don't recommend it at all. The screen freezes a few times a day, so you have to restart it. The fire fly option rarely works. The app store kills me......there is an option to allow outside apps, but the warning is very clear. So I'm nervous to do this because I don't want the phone to crash. The dynamic perspective is great.....if you play games or like looking at the screen saver. It seems the phone has a mind of its own as well, . The mayday button is nice when you can connect,. It's a very frustrating phone to use. You can't personalize it at all, no ringtone apps. No cute little picture to send with texts. No pictures of the kids for background , . Once again the app store is a joke ....yes my books from my kindle are on here, plus, the ear buds that came with it make movies or any audio usage sound amazing, those I love. And amazon prime free for a year, isn't really free, some of the same movies and tv shows that netflix has, for 8 bucks a month, you have to pay handsomely for. Prime does have shows on right away, but I hardly think paying something like 30 bucks for season 4 of once upon a time, not to mention 1 -3 are the same price. Not much of an incentive to use it, I don't feel like I'm getting anything from it. Amazon had a great idea, and this could have been an amazing phone. I really hope they fix these issues, asap.....
This is my first smart phone, and naturally, it is incredibly better than my last one!  LOL - well, it's got to be!  I have Fire tv and a fire hdx tablet - so, it seemed logical to get a firephone.  It was really cheap ($30 some odd dollars) - and then, I got a free year of Prime.  You might say I made money with this phone.<br/><br/>The pictures are wonderful.  The voice recognition seems more limited than I've seen in iphones (what would I know).  This I do know.  You cannot load android apps, other than those made specially for firephone.  So you're screwed, unless you load them sideways? - there's a way to load them.  What a lot of trouble!  Whenever you see a useful app online - it's going to be google play.  And you can't use those (or you can, but if they do something bad to your phone, it's on you).<br/><br/>If you have an amazon fire/kindle household (as I do) - it is quite sensible to get a firephone.  If you don't, then I guess at this point you shouldn't.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong - I love my phone - wouldn't trade it.  I can flip back and forth with all my other fire stuff.  And I believe  (I hope) Amazon sticks with this, and gives us more and better things in the future, as I have made an investment in their "system".  I don't know how you can beat all the free music.  I'll never buy a song from ITunes again - and this makes me strangely happy.  I've spent a lot of money on Itunes.<br/><br/>Oh, you can't just download your itunes songs either.  I think you have to convert them to (MP3?) - I'm not sure.  With all the playlists available from Prime, I haven't even gotten around to looking into that.
I like the phone, but there's a few things I dont like. For example I dont like the camera button on the side of the phone. I am constantly taking picture that I don't need. Also im having a hard thing with getting connected to facebook and I dont want a lot of the icon thats already on the phone.
I've had the Fire Phone for a few days.<br/>Love the 3d, the access to Prime music and Prime books. It syncs with my kindle.<br/>Easy to use. Love mayday help.<br/>Don't like how I have to close apps.<br/>Doesn't recognize all my contacts to call peeps by voice command.<br/>Basic apps are easily available like Facebook and Pinterest.<br/>Love bigger screen than IPhone 5s.<br/>Got all email acts easily on this phone.<br/>Got my Fire Phone at AT&T; store.<br/>Love my Trina Turk phone case. It's beautiful.<br/>Map directions worked great for me.<br/>Weather works fine.<br/>Firefly works ok.<br/>Very happy with this phone!
I really like this phone a lot with a few exceptions; viz., Amazon techs are not familiar with this phone. At least some of them are not. And I still haven't been able to download certain apps from the app store. If certain apps are not compatible why then are they in the app store anyway.
Good phone but needs to be more customizable.  I would like to set my background as a picture and things like that.  But, overall I really like it.  Also, its Bluetooth capability is very limited at this time but hopefully in the future they will put out a software update that fixes that.<br/><br/>Update 11/2015<br/><br/>Everything that runs on the Amazon software has stopped working. The phone is only good as a paperweight.now.<br/><br/>I understand they lost money and don't want to  make new phones but to stop the phone from being able to run its software is ridiculous.<br/><br/>Some people are still stuck with this phone for another year until they can get an upgrade.
Not bad, if the battery life was better that would be great but definitely an upgrade from my previous phone. Has everything I need and customer service is great. Graphics are great and sound as well. Also use the gps, besides the battery it is slippery so a case is a must.
Good phone! Graphics are good, but the auto scrolling needs to be turned off or it will drive you crazy.Battery life seems okay. This phone is definitely for Amazon lovers, and I just happen to be one. Most apps can be sideloaded, its easy to figure out, just google it. I have the bmo harris bank app on mine. I also have Google Maps on it, I just can't login in to save, but I can still use the maps. If you love Amazon, and want a decent phone then this is the phone for you. If your not an amazon fan, stay away, go get an iPhone.<br/><br/>Notes for newbs.<br/>Amazon was nice enough to create Mayday, if you cant figure something out, don't want to bother watching the instructional videos included in the carousel, or think something should be there that isn't then open up Mayday, and talk to the friendly person who is more than happy to help you with any issues.<br/><br/>Apps from the google play store can still be side loaded, I currently have 12 apps from the play store installed and working on my phone. There's a few websites out there that help you download the apps, and install ES File Explorer from the Amazon app store so you can see the files after you download them.<br/><br/>Some Apps that are fully working so far and installed on my phone from the play store:<br/>1) Firefox<br/>2) Microsoft Mobile Office<br/>3) UVO for KIA<br/>4) Xbox Music<br/><br/>THIS PHONE DOES NOT REQUIRE A BACK BUTTON, SWIPE UP FROM THE BOTTOM, NOW STOP BEING LAZY AND WATCH THE INSTRUCTIONAL VIDS.
This was purchased for my 11 year old daughter and she was thrilled after opening it. Being as she already has a Kindle Fire, it made sense to buy her to Fire Phone so she could easy toggle between them. Overall, great phone, no issues and she seems to love it!!
This is the best phone that I ever had.
I do like this phone. I've had it a couple months now.<br/><br/>I don't like:<br/><br/>I hate the Amazon app store, limited apps is turning out to be an issue.<br/>The dumb camera button is in the worst place. I'm constantly accidentally clicking it.<br/>Can't edit carousel to keep certain apps off of it permanently. I.e. Browser history is right there all the time<br/>Wish I could personalize it a bit more, fonts, bg color/photo, etc<br/>Seems a bit heavy<br/>Non Amazon screen protectors kept me from being able to answer calls if they cover any of the four front cameras.<br/>Did I mention I hate the limited app store?<br/><br/>I love!<br/>The cohesion with my Amazon prime acct! Shopping, tracking, updates, all work very well together<br/>I absolutely have fallen in love with the lack of a back button!  You swipe up from button of screen, to go back, awkward at first, now feels natural<br/>It's very pretty, especially 3d graphics, impressive<br/>Battery has actually done very very well for me and I'm a heavy user. Better than any phone I've had before. Deff better than my bf galaxy s4<br/><br/>overall, I don't regret the purchase and I only miss having a real appstore
I just got my fire phone on Friday! I was so excited to try it out and excited to switch from my iPhone! I must say so far I love this phone. Like any new phone you need to spend some time with it and figure things out. When I was looking at a friend's Facebook photo I couldn't find a back button so had to use the home button.since than I found the back button.you just swipe up on the bottom of the screen. I love texting with this phone and am able to text much faster than on my iPhone,also auto correct works much better! There's also a dictionary in which tostore your own words that aren't in the fire dictionary! I love the lock screen pictures as they are meant to work with the dynamic perspective. I have taken numerous pictures and the quality is very good and very easy to share.the monkey buddy is so cute.I guess it's a game and I love it.the phone is well made and browsing is fast! All my books and music are right there in a touch! Navigation on the fire phone is really very simple once you get the hang of it.the battery does drain fast..I let it totally drain this morning....And am charging it right now..my iPhone did that too and draining the battery fixed that issue. Other reviewers said the phone gets hot well mine doesn't get any hotter than my iPhone ever did! UpPersonally I love this phone way better than the iPhone.so glad I didn't listen to the bad reviews and went ahead and purchased.I know amazon will fix any issues with it through updates! Awesome phone and everything seems to work very well.Also I recommend downloading AVG antivirus pro it is made for fire phone and it's free.it includes a task killer,has a power save tool and also has a built-in  call blocker,which many people complained that you couldn't block calls with the fire phone.update: after totally discharging the battery and than recharging the battery to 100 percent I left it mostly idle did like 5 text the battery is at 81 percent after only 3 hours! So the battery is very sadly lacking in energy. Had I gone online it would most likely be on the charger again. Maybe that's why the power charger is so long so u can surf with it plugged in! Nothing worse on a smart phone than a battery drains to quickly. I never talked on the phone are went on the internet and this is how fast the battery drained! Hopefully amazon will fix this issue or whole lot of phones may need to be returned.
UPDATES BELOW!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>I couldn't wait for this phone to come out. I absolutely love the phone. It has a lot of very cool features and does stand out from the other phones. It was definitely worth the wait.  I feel that the Fire phone is easy to use, especially for people that have little to no experience with smartphones. Myself included.  I had been dragging my heels on upgrading my phone to a smartphone. The other phones  everyone has. I wanted something different.  When AT&T; finally had the phone I went in to look and that was it. I had to have it. There are a couple of things that I think need adjusting before the next generation of these phones comes out.  Reading some of the other reviews, I realized on some of the issues I'm not crazy.<br/><br/>1- The phone gets very hot. Not warm...HOT.  It feels like it's going to melt or explode. My phone spends some time in speaker mode. The phone does cool down pretty quickly if you set it aside for a few minutes.<br/><br/>2- The battery doesn't last. I have had to charge the phone almost every day since I got it. Not a super huge deal but a bit annoying. Going to purchase a second charger incase I forget to charge before work.<br/><br/>3- The status bar doesn't appear at the top. You have to tilt the phone to see it.<br/><br/>I have not used Mayday yet.  I am still exploring the phone. So I will be updating my review as I find more loves and dislikes.<br/><br/>The screen resolution is amazing. Very  very clear picture.  I love the size of the phone.  There is a good seleection of apps. They have something for everyone. I found a coin collecting app. It's a fun phone.<br/><br/>*************************************************************************************************************************<br/>UPDATE<br/><br/>I got some really helpful tips for all of the issues I was having with my phone.  See the comments below.  They seemed to work.
So far  I really do like the phone. The lack of apps you already have on Google Play can be an issue if your an Android user (I miss my Noom).<br/>I've seen a lot of people complain about battery life, and I can say, if you leave Bluetooth on it is pretty bad, but once I only turned it on when I was using it the life went way up (it is 3.0).<br/>I love Firefly, but got to be honest, if Amazon doesn't make that available to all platforms it would be a huge mistake, so it probably isn't something worth buying the phone for.<br/>The integration with Fire TV is awesome.<br/>The speaker volume is horrible though, also I am not sure if the cover makes it worse. Also odd thing I noted. I use an AUX cable rather than Bluetooth in car. Every other Android when I did this, would turn on my mic and play the person through my speakers, it did not seem to do this.<br/>The sound was way better than my Samsung Galaxy III for music not even close so I was happy about that.<br/>Charge time was great.<br/>The swiping in the interface is great, the twist is good, but the tilt left right isn't as intuitive or as universal to be viable yet.<br/>Overall, I am someone majorly hooked into Amazon (I have all my music there like 3 songs at iTunes and like 90% of my video purchases are there and like 10% on Xbox).<br/>So it is a great phone for me ... may not be for everyone, but I think people are being overly harsh on a first generation phone in some reviews. If we could just come out with a fitness watch or band that works with this and an arm exercise strap it would be so much more useful for me.<br/>**** UPDATE 10-10-14 ****<br/>Battery is now fantastic not sure what they did, but I use the sync with Fire TV, and even this doesn't drain the battery any more.<br/>I still wish I had access to several of the apps which seem to be on Google Play only, but oh well.<br/>Again Battery Issues Are Solved!
While, the "Fire Phone" is far from being perfect, I think that Amazon created a device that is defiantly different from any other smart phone on the market right now. The Firefly, Dynamic Perspective and Mayday are just a few of the new features that are offered with the phone. I think for Amazon's first time try they did a great job with the Fire Phone. From my understanding Amazon is in progress with improving some of the missing apps, I'll wait for the accommodations being made.<br/><br/> I think that Amazon wanted to create a phone for Amazons customers and some of those who were not a part of the Amazon community, to merge and enjoy the perks of shopping with Amazon.  However, those who have tested the device in comparison with other devices they were use to; may have tainted and spoiled there taste of what a good phone should entail. That is a big mistake in my opinion; you simply can't enjoy the phone if you're going to compare it with other devices (just enjoy the new features that's offered) it simply doesn't help if you're thinking of the old things you are already use to. On the other hand, like myself and a few others customers feel that it's a good match to some of the high end phones on the market, perhaps it isn't top notch , but it fits in with some mediocre to high competition.<br/>I'm doing a quick update , well one thing you should know that I didn't is IF YOU ARE HAVING YOUR PHONE SHIPPED , YOUR 14 DAYS HAS ALREADY STARTED FROM THE MOMENT IT SHIPS. IF IT TAKES 3-5 BUSINESS DAYS YOU HAVE LESS THAN 7 TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND IF YOU CHOOSE TO KEEP IT. I was very upset about this issue , because it should have started once I received the device. The perk is that, I plan to keep it, because I adore it the crisp screen, picture quality is great ,and I find myself calling Mayday just to use the feature, it's just that cool. I'm waiting on Amazon to make some changes. (Today is 8/1/14) I'll be back soonfor more updates.<br/><br/>To tell you the truth, I was scared straight literally only because of some of the bad reviews here. I figured I would take a chance and see for myself "each his own" with the bad to worst reviews, I'm sure Amazon will probably create another device and tweak some of the customer's request in their 2nd phone to come. I think I'm going to ride this one out  with Amazon, until something new comes along that is as eccentric as some of the feature offered here with the Fire Phone.<br/><br/>I plan to update throughout the year and see if I can post a video of the phone. I bought my phone through At&t.;
its not without its own issues. I got mine on thursday from my pre-order with at&t.;<br/><br/>For non kindle fire owners, the phone will have a learning curve. Heck, I own a kindle reader, 2 Fires and 2 Fire HDs and a fire tv and there were spots that tripped me up at the start.I only have 2 real complaints with the phone. First off is the camera button. For my hand, I am all the time hitting that darn button, when I am picking it up or even holding it. I am hoping a case (which I have on order) will help with that some. I bought my wife a fire phone as well and her case does seem to help make it a little harder to accidentally hit it.<br/>My second gripe is the battery life. My phone is currently on its third charging cycle as I write this so hopefully after a few more it will get better. My first charge went from 100% to 25% within about 6 hours. Most of that was just playing with the phone, going through menus, sending a few texts. A couple minutes make on video and music. At the time of the 2nd charge, the system was the top user of battery life followed by the screen.<br/>My second charge, I took it off the charger and let it sit for 12 hours doing nothing but being a phone. No calls, no texts, nothing. It lost only 2% battery life and that is with wifi on. With light use over the next several hours, sending some texts, a couple of games that were played about 5 minutes each, some navigation through settings and a couple web searches and I went to bed with 68% battery life. Over the course of today, very light use, a few texts and I was down to 56% battery life. At 56%, I loaded up plex and watched a 40 minute tv show from my server using the phones speakers set to about half volume. Checkinig it afterwards, I was down to 35%. I fired up netflix and started watching Deep space 9 (using the included headphones at even less volume) and was about 30 minutes into it when I got a popup that I was at 14% battery life. Again, the number one battery hog was system followed by screen. And FYI, screen is set to auto brightness and is somewhere around 10-15% less on the system battery report. My media watching took up less than 10% of the battery (not including screen use).  So far, the phone in standby mode uses very little power and could easily go several days if no texts or calls received. It seems once you wake it up, the system is chewing up the battery like butter. I can only hope that this can be addressed with a software update.<br/><br/>With the above said, I really do like the rest of the phone. I am coming from a windows phone and my wife is coming from an android phone however I did all the work on her phone so I had gotten used to android as well. I also want to state that my household basically is an amazon household. 90% of our orders are from amazon ( get packages weekly) and I have been a prime member for many years. So with that said, I figured at the announcement that I would like the phone as I am deep into the amazon eco system. I do have complaints about all my amazon devices, none of them are perfect but the pros far outweigh the cons.<br/><br/>I like the dynamic perspective on the fire phone. Is it gimmicky? Yes, but it has its uses. the biggest use of it is decluttering your screen. Even if its just a couple lines, it keeps things off it till you tilt it. I actually like that feature and I am glad to have it.Further development should provide some interesting and fun stuff!<br/><br/>Gesture control is fine and can be a little troublesome at times but once you get the hang of it, its not to bad. Amazon considers it a key feature for the phone but I don't. Again, its nice for some things but a swipe is almost as easy. I am glad its there but it isnt the thing that made me say I want this phone.<br/><br/>Firefly works pretty dang well. I have had it post the wrong item a few times but it gets most of them right. Its ability to tell you what tv show or movie you are watching on the tv is amazing. It never seems to take more than 5 words being spoken on the screen and bam, it has what you are watching on its screen. Its almost eerie in how well it works.<br/><br/>The things I like about the phone are the little things. Quick replies to texts, adding a photo to a text, and a bunch of others. That 3 panel system for the screen really adds tons of value to this phone. I hope developers embrace that and really take advantage of it.<br/>Some people have complained out the weight of the phone, its 5.5 OUNCES. Get a grip people, its not like that is heavy. The phone feels solid and well built, I will give them that. Coming from the phones that my wife and I had, it is much slimmer and weighs less.<br/><br/>Overall I am very pleased with the phone. I do think the price is to high for it, This really should have been a $300-$400 phone. but that is the price we pay for being the first to get these phones. I would say to all the folks out there, if you are a big amazon consumer, this phone may be for you. If you are not, then there are plenty of other choices out there. I think its a good first phone for amazon, Here is hoping version 2 comes when it comes time for a new upgrade for me!<br/><br/>Update to my review:<br/><br/>I keep its rating the same but I just wanted to mention the camera.<br/>It is great and horrible at the same time. I am going to include 2 pictures in here so you can see why I love and hate the camera. At least on the current version of the os which is the release os.<br/><br/>The problem is shutter speed. It is a slow camera as other reviewers have said. How slow do you ask. This first picture is of my two dogs. Notice the dog laying still and the how great her part of the photo turned out. My other dog was standing still but started to move as I took the picture. Look how blurry he is.  I hate to say it, but I have seen throw away cameras take better moving shots.<br/>https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive/share?s=py4TstutQtgh_8hf5wEKKg<br/><br/>This next picture is of our cat laying on my wifes lap asleep. No zoom, she was that close to him when she snapped the picture.<br/>https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive/share?s=eCAiEBOURQgomZOvQ8CS2M<br/><br/>Now, with that said. I want to point out that I take terrible photos or at least I used to. I have a very unsteady hand when it comes to cameras and I think this camera compensates for me beautifully. I can only hope that the new update due out in a few weeks adds the ability to have a faster shutter speed on this camera.
The Amazon Fire Phone combines most, but not all, of the things I liked best about my old iPhone, Android phone, and Kindle Fire HDX. The Fire Phone also offers some useful and entertaining features you cannot find on any other phone. Dynamic Perspective works surprisingly well and the Amazon software ecosphere adds a seemingly endless amount of content and valuable services with minimal hassle. I was worried when I started reading so many negative professional reviews, but I honestly think the Fire is tough competition for the Apple, Samsung and HTC flagship phones.<br/><br/>== Display == (5 stars)<br/>My first two smartphones were Apple's iPhone 3G and then the iPhone 4. While I enjoyed them at the time, the 4.7"-5" display found on many Android phones is just so much nicer to use. The Fire has a 4.7" IPS display, which is like my husband's HTC One (M7), but the resolution is only 1280 x 720. The AMOLED display used on the Samsung Galaxy seems to have slightly better contrast, but the colors are so over-saturated that I think the HTC One and Amazon Fire look better overall.<br/><br/>I thought I might hate the less-than-full HD resolution, but I really don't notice it unless I'm watching a high quality full-HD movie by myself. The resolution is higher than any iPhone and matches the Samsung Galaxy 3. The pixel density is still pretty high at 315 ppi. The best thing about the display is how bright it can get. It is the first phone display I have used that is easy to see when it's sunny outside.<br/><br/>== Features == (5 stars)<br/>Dynamic Perspective is the obvious differentiating feature and it really works well. The effect is just like looking into a small window - your field of view and perspective change with the position of the phone relative to your eyes. When I saw the layout of the 4 sensors I thought it might be an issue to hold the phone without covering the sensors so the effect would work. However, it turns out you can cover 1 or 2 of the sensors and the Fire will still track your head. It also uses the internal accelerometer, which I find helps it work seamlessly when you are tilting it in different directions to change the perspective. While it is really cool, there isn't a ton you can do with it...for now. I haven't gotten used to the gesture controls yet, but I think they might need more refinement through a software update. Given how well the technology works visually, I am sure a ton of apps making smart use of Dynamic Perspective will arrive over the next few months.<br/><br/>Firefly is the other innovative feature Amazon is touting for this phone. At first I thought it would be just like some of the apps I have used to take a picture of a product and find it online. Firefly goes much further in the type of content you can access using the Fire's camera. If you show your phone the TV show you are watching, you may be treated to a surprising amount of information on the episode, actors, etc. It's just fun to play around with at first, but I think it will come in handy and help me greatly expand my knowledge of useless things.<br/><br/>The Fire Phone also has all the great features I love from my Kindle Fire HDX. Mayday is really, really helpful if you ever get stuck or something goes wrong on your phone. It isn't all that different from calling technical support on the phone, just better in every way. The introduction video to the phone is a minor, but very helpful feature.<br/><br/>Since everyone who has a Fire Phone will have Amazon Prime for a year, I should mention that Prime Instant Video and Prime Music are both terrific, despite obviously having gaping holes in their content libraries. I think I might try the new Kindle Unlimited just for the audio books. And, Kindle FreeTime is such a treat for my kids on my Kindle Tablet that maybe it'd be in my best interest to keep it off the Fire Phone. Some people don't like being locked into Amazon's world, but for me it is a big positive, just like some people prefer to be locked into Apple's iOS. The Amazon app store has every app I've ever wanted or have used on my Android devices.<br/><br/>== Hardware == (4 Stars)<br/>The internals on the Amazon Fire Phone have their ups and downs. The camera is a big up with 13 megapixels and beautiful performance. Compared to the HTC One (M7 and M8) it is vastly superior and beats out other phone's cameras that I have used. Downs include the small battery (2400 mAh), lack of microSD and last-gen processor (Snapdragon 800). However, none of these seem to matter at all. The battery seems to drain slowly, much slower than the HTC One (M7), though I'm speaking from brief experience. With 64GB of space the lack of microSD is less of an issue. I haven't tried out too many games, but so far I have not noticed any lag at all. Since the resolution is only 1280 x 720, it makes sense that the processor wouldn't need to be as fast as those on the S5 or HTC M8. Speakers that are decent compared to most phones but disappointing compared to the HTC One. The included earbuds work well and don't tangle, as promised.<br/><br/>== Build == (3 Stars)<br/>The Fire Phone is an almost perfect blend between the iPhone 4 (on back) and Kindle Fire HDX (on front). I kind of like the higher end look of the iPhone 5 and especially the HTC One. However, I don't' think it looks bad compared to the Samsung Galaxy. If you are going to use a case, it doesn't really matter anyway.<br/><br/>The size is a bit smaller than the Galaxy and HTC One, though marginally thicker than the Galaxy. It is bigger than the iPhone obviously. It is also a bit heavy like the HTC One, which is surprising since it is smaller and doesn't have all that metal, but it is still comfortable to use. The smaller size helps a lot using it one handed, which I do a lot. There is a hardware button for home, which I like better than the software button for home on the HDX.<br/><br/>== Overall == (5 stars, assuming you remain a Prime member after 1 year)<br/>On paper, the Amazon Fire Phone has some big strengths and weaknesses. Using the phone however, I don't really notice any weaknesses. The phone does lack a high-end/flagship look and feel, but that is easily compensated for with the right case. Also, it does get hot sometimes, but not as hot as the HTC One (M7).<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who is an Amazon Prime member or frequent Amazon shopper. It is also the only Android phone I would recommend to my parents. I do expect the software and apps for this phone to improve noticeably over the next few months. This is a great Phone as it is, but has a lot of unique advantages that currently have more potential than practical benefit. The pricing is higher than what I was hoping for, but after you factor in the free year of Prime, unlimited cloud storage, 1000 amazon coins and the 32GB base memory, it is an attractive value.
This device is exactly what I was looking for. First off, I love Amazon services. I love watching the videos, listening to music and reading the books. I also buy everything I can on Amazon. I even buy my food on Amazon. I use the FireFly feature all the time. When I'm out and about and I see something I want to buy ~ I just take a quick snap shot of the item and choose whether or not to buy it later or 1 click and it's on it's way to my house. Same with a song I hear that I like. FireFly is so very convenient to me because I am not an impulsive buyer. It stores the things I'm interested in buying for a later purchase. And I always shop around for the best deal.<br/>Bottom line; the things that I do on my phone works perfectly with the Fire Phone. I listen to music (which you can only download the Prime Music with a Fire device), I watch Movie and TV shows (again downloadable with a Fire) I read books (can only get free books with a Fire) I make purchases (Super easy with FireFly). And yes, it does works well as just a smart phone. Call, email, text, and navigation. The camera is the best I've ever used. I traded my Samsung S4 for this phone and have not regretted it since. The battery life is better than the S4 too.<br/>I'm not sure what all the unsatisfied customers were looking. I said what I was looking for and how I use my phone and I am a happy owner. I've been able to side load the apps that are not on the Amazon App Store (look it up, it's easy).<br/>What I don't like? A minor thing. I was using Google drive and docs to do document stuff. Now I use Amazon's equivalent. But the fact that I can't use any of the Google apps does not sit well with me. However, I don't use them anyway.
This is a nice phone. Nothing more.<br/><br/>Fire Phone falls short of many other phones on the market. I will explain the things we dislike about the Fire Phone, and why we returned it. The phone got very hot while using navigation, burn you hot. You can change the lock screen but there is no way you can change your background. The speaker distorts a little when on speaker phone. Has hangups and lagging issues. The app selection is desolate. Another weird thing, the navigation does say what exit you should take but it does not show the exit in text, easily forgotten.<br/><br/>I love Amazon, but do not do business with Amazon Wireless, they expected me to wait a week and a half for another phone when they originally said one day turn over. We tried purchasing the LG G3 from them but they said "we must wait to get the other device back", before they would set up another device and send it out. I hated sprint but at least they would make sure you had a phone, this is horrible service.
I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. The phone feels nice and solid and basically works just fine. The 32 gigs of memory makes  up for the inability  to add a micro sd card.
I love the phone and technology, but there are some 'deal-breaker' features.  Most disappointing to me is that the Bluetooth technology of the Fire is not compatible with the Bluetooth of my car.  I didn't even know there were different Bluetooths!  Also, the activation button is actually a raised button, not a recessed button like the iPhone.  Now I know why the recessed button is a better feature...the Fire gets accidentally activated whenever I put it in my pocket or lay it down upside down.  The carousel feature is nifty, but you have to remember to close everything every time you use the Fire or everything will stay open in the carousel.  What this means is you can practically watch the battery drain and the Fire gets really hot; probably not what they intended when they named it Fire. And, finally, I have talked to several customer service representatives trying to get my free year of Prime membership added on to my existing membership instead of a concurrent second membership, but no success yet.
For those who got it for $200... YES!!! And yes, this is my first smartphone. A true luxury! And for those of you who dislike it, learn how to use a tech device.. all the tools are here, it just may take some reorganization ;) And I enjoy tinkering :) And smart move Amazon :) I actually was compelled to write this review. Five stars to you! Bravo!!
Excellent phone; great features
I was going to get an iPhone 6 because I already had an iPhone, but they were out of stock, so getting a fire was a complete chance. I can't say I regret it though. The only con that I've had so far is that the app store is tiny, and if they improved that then I would give 5 stars. The main pros are how how well the phone works, it is fast and does not have me waiting for apps to load. The battery life works for me although sometimes I do have to charge it during the day if I play apps too often. I got a 64 gb and have not run out of memory even with putting roms on the phone using an apk installer. The only other request besides adding a bigger app store is to put the ringer and media volume on the swipe down menu as sometimes I want to change my ringer volume while having music on. All in all I would and have recommended this phone to others and can see it becoming a large competitor with Apple and Samsung if they fix these minor issues.
I really love my Fire phone.  I get annoyed that some of my favorite apps are not available, which costs it a star, but honestly, it is my favorite phone.  I currently have a Samsung Note for work and my Fire phone is replacing an iPhone.  So I have used a lot of phones.  While the Fire phone seemed quirky at first, I really got it for testing as I am a front-end web developer.<br/><br/>The thing is, the more I used it, the more I missed some of its basic features on my Note.  The swipe back button, the dual side menus, the tilt scroll and the audio is fantastic.<br/><br/>As someone with poor vision,  I wish the Fire had the Note's screen size, but the current screen is big enough.  Ultimately it is just the easiest phone I have ever used and when I see it I get excited to use it, even a month in.<br/><br/>Fill the app store and that four star becomes a five star to me.  But in terms of a phone I want to use, this is a winner.
I have had my Fire Phone since the day they were released. It takes some getting used to, but once you do the flow of everything feels cleaner and more efficient than any other phone I have had. Battery life is the best I have ever had. Only down side to date is the limited number of apps, but I expect that will change with a little time.
A great cell phone! I've had no technical issues what so ever with the fire phone. The choices of apps from amazon can more than satisfy any needs. The features such as  perspective and firefly are useful. As usual, it is obvious that Amazon did not skimp on quality. This phone is an excellent product, so go ahead...Dare to be different!
So far I am pretty impressed with the phone. I do have to say, though, I am completely disappointed in the amazon app store. Very limited options to choose from.
UPDATED:<br/><br/>Where to begin? I wanted to love it. I really did. The commercials hooked me, and on August 2 I went to an AT&T; store, spent half an hour playing, and decided to upgrade to the Fire phone.<br/><br/>First, what I liked:<br/>- The speed. Can't beat the 4G LTE speed on the device. Smooth and quick.<br/>- The dynamic perspective: the envy of everyone. It was a definite eye catcher, and was great with the maps.<br/>- speaking of the maps... Fantastic. I traveled around Oregon on this with friends, it was awesome. Perfect navigation. Clean and easy.<br/>- the screen size- in for the win.<br/>- The camera. WOW! 13 Megapixels rocked!! Great in low light. Hard to beat. Best phone camera I have seen. The flash leaves a bit to be desired, but without it I snagged some amazing shots.<br/>- The device fluidity. I was great to flow quickly from one screen to another. Would I say it's intuitive? No. But the potential is there.<br/>-My one interaction with the Mayday button was quite pleasant.<br/><br/>What broke me:<br/>- The app availability: So many games available... if you're in to that. But it took a month just for Uber to become available. And no Starbucks app?!? It was the little things. Plus, the Android/ Google play store blocked.<br/>-The horrendous time I had transferring music and photos to/from the device. Half the time, I would get a message, "The device is locked, transfers cancelled," and the device was unlocked. When it worked, it was sloooooow. And album art would not show up. Then trying to download music from the Amazon store, and it would not show up in the music player, I had to search around for it. The worst part? Trying to create a playlist, only for it to delete tracks half way through the selection process if I tried to go back and add tracks. It was painful.<br/>- The less than seemless switch from Facebook to an external link. Click a link in FB, it would jump to the browser window. But when you were done, you had to close the browser and switch back to FB manually. Not good. Too many steps.<br/>-The browser. Only built in, no alternatives. I wanted Chrome or something, but not alternatives in the Amazon store. It used Bing as a search engine. Um, no.<br/>-The wrist motions to flip between screens... yeah, need to improve recognition of that.It would take two or three times to work, and the looks I got from people were amusing.<br/>-Battery life: had to charge it daily. Small complaint, and normally it was relatively quick, but on occasion it took forever. One day in particular: The day I came home from my trip, I recall having about 60% charge as I left the airport for my house after a 5 hour flight. When I got home, the device had powered off on its own, and would not turn back on at all. It was liked it had bricked up. I plugged it in to charge and went to sleep for 5 hours. I awoke, and the device STILL was not charged. As I tried to turn it on, I saw a brief flash of a charging symbol, which indicated to me it needed more time plugged in. So I did. 5 hours later, and it was only 40% charged. While this only happened once, it was enough to concern me.<br/>-Contacts- it would duplicate contacts two or three times, and the merging of contacts was messy and cumbersome. It would list the same number numerous times under one person. Then, it wouldn't alphabetize properly depending on where it was downloaded from. Manual sorting was a time suck.<br/>- No way to 'kill' apps. That was a power suck. Added a third party app to do so, wasn't great but cut it for the time I had it.<br/>-Bluetooth- with my iPhone it would sync with my fitbit. This did not. I ended up losing my fitbit on my trip, and lost 5 days of my walking and tracking because it wouldn't sync. I was bummed by that.<br/>-The final straw? Amazon lowered the price 30 days after I had purchased it.<br/><br/>So needless to say, I am awaiting my iPhone 6 plus and rocking an iPhone 3G for a phone. I was appreciative that the store where I bought it took it back, they so did not have to, but did without blinking an eye. So it's been returned.<br/><br/>Sorry Amazon, you need to put some work into this device before I would consider it again. Great bones, but as one would say, it's all in the details. And your details are NOT there. An, Amazon, PLEASE STOP CALLING ME, I DO NOT HAVE THE DEVICE ANY LONGER.
Overall I like the phone. It is definitely going through the growing pains expected of a brand new device intended to disrupt the market. Although I'm not so sure it has the unique features necessary to accomplish a market disruption. But it certainly is a formidable attempt.<br/><br/>The integration with Amazon is well-engineered and therefore reliable.<br/><br/>I like Dynamic Perspective, because it does what it was intended to do; it helps you use the phone one-handed. That said, it is probably what eats the battery, and it takes getting used to. I still want to use two hands even when I don't need to. Like any new feature of course, it needs to mature.<br/><br/>Firefly is cool, and useful, but needs a little more work. I wish it would recognize company name and address when it is formatted properly on a business card. by formatted properly, I mean as it would appear on an envelope. I don't expect it to recognize a randomly formatted address block, but I did expect it to recognize the standard format for the locale i.e. USA, Canada, etc.<br/><br/>Biggest Complaint: Battery Life. UGH! it's terrible! If I left it alone all day and didn't take more than one or two short calls, the battery might last all day. But who leaves a smartphone alone for an entire day?<br/><br/>Favorite Feature(s): I can't really point to just one as "the favorite" so my list, in no particular order: phone calls are clear on both ends of the call; screen is very bright when I need it and very dim when I need that; Learning curve wasn't as bad as I expected.<br/><br/>What would I change: let me swap out the battery; Look at all the spare batteries you guys could sell if you allowed users to change the battery... you're missing a cash cow here.
Former iphone user I Will probably go back to iphone if Amazon  does not get more useful apps I like this phone  I have a kindle paper white a kindle fire and fire tv and of course Amazon prime after the price went down to 99 cent I used the May day and got a refund on price Amazon customer service is great
I got this phone from AT&T; a few days ago.  I was sceptic because of all the bad reviews but I have a 14 day trial to see if I like it.  So I thought, what the hell.<br/>So far, I love it.  Works very similar to my kindle so getting used to it was relatively easy.  Also, I have had new phones that go bad quick, I know the process to replace and it's pretty easy so I wasn't worried.  This being Amazon's first attempt, the likelihood of it not being 100% could have been high, but so far it's fine.<br/>Review online that the phone was dropped and it broke, or apps not being the same from apple (i'm coming off iPhone after 6 years), that's no reason to give a phone 1 star.  That's actually really stupid...glass breaks and it's not an apple phone, so the technology wont be the same.  If you want apple apps, stick with apple.  Ok I'm done ranting.<br/>This phones peek technology isn't fantastic but it's fun to play with (like siri).  The texting is easy and the guessing what you want to say next is pretty cool.<br/>Not all the apps I had on my apple are available, that's true, but there are so many other apps that do the same thing, and most are free, so no big deal.  The screen is large, very good colors, and I am finding its a little easier to use than the apple products.<br/>Now for switching from apple to android...I was afraid of doing so mostly because of music, but the tech at AT&T; explained how easy it is to do, and he war right, super fast and easy.<br/>Downloading apps is the same way on android app store as it was on the apple store.<br/>All in all, it's a smart phone that works as a smart phone.  It's a great phone and I am happy I have it.
i wanted to write a little review from a perspective that wasn't tied strictly down to google or apple apps/ products so customers interested in this phone that aren't tied down to those companies can gain a little bit of insight on how their experience will be when they purchase the amazon fire phone. so i've had my phone for a week now, and i have made my decision on whether i was happy with my purchase or not. first off, i would like to note that i have been an iphone user for 3 years. I would like to first off mention the great service that i get from at&t.; i have been screwed over by sprint, and verizon overpaying for service fees in the area; and i never had any clue that it was just because they are not the dominant service provider in my area. In the same areas where i was the most, at&t; provided the most coverage than any other service provider i have been in contract with. Secondly, i would like to note the eco system. I only used a few apps, and every app that i used, it was provided by amazon so i wasn't losing out. As far as the 99 cent price you are not losing out on much. If you are an amazon fan, please get this phone. I have already had some really good instances where firefly has helped me purchase items i needed, and also it recognizes music and that is a major plus for me. The dynamic perspective is alright but to be honest you will get used to it real quickly and you will be more fascinated by the other main features of this phone. All in all the phone is a great phone and i haven't had any technical issues yet or needed the mayday service. I really don't understand why the phone didn't do well it is a nice product.
Love my phone.  I switched from an Iphone and never thought I would like a different software.  Everything transferred to my Fire without any issues.  My favorite part is MayDay and Firefly!  The only thing I miss about my iphone was the FaceTime, but that is easily replaced with Skype!
Excellent if not Better!<br/>Folks, this is a solidly built phone, I have had it for 9 months, the battery life is a good two (2) days worth of normal calls, internet browsing and email sending. The screen is crystal clear and I love the wrist gestures and easy to get to navigation. The reception is just about Fantastic where my iPhone would let me down over and over again. I am not new to smart phones, I purchased my first iPhone in 2007 on the day it was introduced!<br/><br/>Unlike some of the reviews, I have not encountered earth shuttering negative experiences with this phone, there has been times that it runs warmer due to heavy usage specially GPS navigation but to get so hot to feel a burning sensation, Not!<br/><br/>The biggest difficulty I have had is to spend a bit of time and learn its O/S (Operating system) and not treat it like an iPhone, I have a iPhone 5 running IOS 8.xx and I finally decided to shelf it. The only reason I had been using the iPhone was the belief that I would miss my applications, well I have Not!<br/>Forget about the iPhone, clumsy, no reception, lousy at best interface. Forget about it.<br/><br/>I hope that Amazon does not drop the line, this is a really solid phone. I want to admit I always read the negative reviews first, I find it funny how some people use the platform to write about their own personal agenda, I find most of the negative reviews are subjectively self-serving. Reviews are important, but a review like I dropped the phone and it Broke, are just subjective at best, no?<br/>T<br/>hank you Amazon for this lovely phone.
I love this phone. If you have an amazon tablet and love it, you will love this phone. It is a lot like a kindle tablet, but it's a smart phone.
I'm enjoying the fire phone.  I'm a amazon customer which means I have kindle books, amazon prime, and so having everything in one place is ideal for me.  I see where improvements can be made like the songs on the music. App are very sensitive, you are in a's one minute the next in w's.  I needed a new phone because with every update on my iphone, I lost another function.  I'm very pleased with the phone and See with updates it can become even better.  As for as being warm to touch my iPhone was the same way, so I'm not sure about that issue.
I'm confused by the negative reviews. We absolutely LOVE this phone. Love it. Here's our story. We also have a Samsung S5 and an older iPhone 5. The Fire Phone is our favorite one. Here's why.<br/><br/>Great graphics - love the 3D effects.<br/><br/>Great camera. The Samsung's camera is also fantastic. We don't see a difference between them.<br/><br/>I wish it would hold a memory chip, but we're fine without it. We got the 64GB phone.<br/><br/>Battery power seems to be the same as the Apple (when it was new) and the Samsung.<br/><br/>Apps are GREAT. Better than the Apple apps and the apps I found for the Samsung. I'm not sure about the complaints about apps here.<br/><br/>EXAMPLE: Music ID app (Firefly) is MUCH BETTER than anything I have found for the other phones. I have put Shazam and SoundHound on my Samsung. We love classical music - Firefly always finds our music. Shazam and SoundHound do not find many of the pieces that Firefly finds. That's fantastic.<br/><br/>Mayday feature is FANTASTIC! To have a tech person right there on the phone to help you? Love it! Love it.<br/><br/>The ONLY problem we had occurred when we put a screen protector on the phone. All sorts of problems started then - turns out, most of the screen protectors cover at least one sensor that is essential to phone function. Looking at reviews of the screen protectors, I can see this is a major problem - next time, I read reviews before purchasing them.<br/><br/>I don't understand the negative reviews of this phone.
I just bought this phone a couple hours ago, and I love it! I don't follow phones or technology much. I use them for work and play. I've been through a number of them over the years. The last few years replacement has come of necessity and I have always found getting used to the new phone to be a pain. Yesterday, my last phone went for a swim. Today I walked into AT&T; and bought this phone and have been loving it. First, the service at AT&T; was awesome, they even opened the door as I approached the store. I am not used to this kind of service as my  previous carrier was sprint. The minute my new account was set up, I was able to find the apps I need, sync Email and even find some of the phone numbers I had lost due to the syncing on Google.<br/>The Screen! Wow, this is one of the things I love about this phone, the picture is clear and sharp.<br/>Interfacing with amazon has also  been fun, everything I had for Audible or Kindle is now available to me on this phone, and Prime too! The thought of watching a movie on my phone used to horrify me, but with the new screen I'm liking the idea. It's small but I could manage to see it even with bad eyesight.
My husband and I have had our fire phones since May 2014. We love them. Takes great photos that I can upload to Facebook, email, messenger, or texts. So easy. I have over 4000 photos stored in the cloud and/or on my phone. People are jealous of the great sharp photos it takes. It's easy to use. Syncs with my Kindle Fire so what ever I'm reading is always available. I play games on it and Skype with family. No complaints. There were a couple of apps I was missing, but within a couple of months they became available. And I found apps that easily replaced any others that weren't available... Customer service is awesome for the few questions I had in the beginning. No problems with Firefly either. I hope Amazon gets the phone up and running again.
First the bad...<br/>What apps it is shipped with and the few I tried worked seem great.<br/> BUT,,,,,, Since you cannot use Google Play your apps are limited and most of what is offered are not free.<br/>The Bluetooth has a major flaw, you cannot initiate a call via your handsfree anything except on the phone.<br/>Hit the call button on your device such as BT enabled radio or steering wheel control and nothing happens on the phone.<br/>It will hang up a call but as for voice dialing without picking up your phone and initiating a call well worthless from that standpoint.<br/>What is hands free if you cannot make a call without picking up your phone.<br/>I spent a LOT of time with Amazon Fire Phone support and this is currently not supported, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!<br/>Importing contacts hmmmmmm, AT&T; stores equipment is not set up to transfer contacts so if you purchase the phone you have 2 options; 1 use bluetooth transfer which will fail halfway through unless you fully charge the Fire Phone first. 2 manually input all your contacts.<br/>Since you do not have full access to google, if you had backed up your contacts to your google plus account forget it that is not an option.<br/>The 3d display is fantastic, the tilt and look around is the best I have seen.<br/>The Voice recognition is also well done better than most, (Since I have not tried SIRI I did not compare it)<br/>The device is a great size and controls are easy to use.
I too wanted to love this phone.  I love most things Amazon, but not the Fire phone.  The battery life is awful; the unit gets hot; and most importantly, I can't use a lot of apps I had on my iPhone.  I'm still within the 30 day window and I'm returning my Fire phone today.  Other than buying the Fire phone, I made another mistake.  I bought my phone directly from Amazon and entered a 2-year contract with my carrier, AT&T.;  I'd been waiting to enter another contract with the purchase of a new phone.  Now, I have to wait 2 years to buy a new phone unless I pay full price.  If I'd bought the phone from AT&T; I wouldn't have that problem.  If you just need to try the phone, buy it from AT&T; not Amazon so you won't have the same problem.
It's something new! It's q new inovation in cell phone tech and I already love Amazon. I do a lot of shopping on it, I ordered a package and was surprised when my phone notified me that it was delivered.<br/>The Dynamic view is fantastic. Keeps my screen clean when I can just flick my wrist and it handles it all for me. Its a new step for cell phones in the right direction. They really took notes from the current #1s like Samsung and Apple and created something new. I was surprised with it being the first of a new era it is running very smoothly. I expect generation two will be a huge impact much like Microsoft and the Surface 2 -- there will be imitators but Amazon and AT&T; will always be first. Love it.
The phone in general isn't bad especially when you add a sideloading application on the phone.<br/><br/>What I do like about it.<br/>1. The screen is quite clear<br/>2. 3d is a nifty trick and hasn't so far induced any headaches<br/>3. Speed of boot and shutdown are decent<br/>4. Speaker and Mic are quite clear at least compared to my old Iphone 4<br/><br/>There are a few things that need to be worked on.<br/>1. There needs to be a method by which one can control which apps can use data at what times.<br/>2. There is a need to allow someone to alter the background of the phone in general<br/>3. Find a way to allow apps that work on a typical android phones to work on this one (RedFin, some religious apps to name a few)<br/>4. An easy way to alter the rings for individual workers<br/>5. Get the dynamic lighting method to work. I don't thing any phone has got this to work, but it would be really nice. (this shouldn't be too hard with all of the spectrum sensors on this phone. Find the ratio between the highest light source that is visible and what the phone controller likes and use that ratio as a base for all external light sources. As new information is obtained, fit the information to some function that can define the screen brightness that is needed)<br/><br/>Overall, it is something I can live with and not hate myself for having it.
This phone is amazing.  Every day I find it easier and easier to use.  The pictures I have taken are so amazing I wish I could attach some.  I have read the reviews from others, but I actually use this phone for home and work.  Email is great and WAY easy to set up.  I love the amazon prices for music and I have a huge MP3 collection that is always available.  ONLY DRAWBACK is I had to switch to AT@T and they do not alway have the best signal, but not bad.  This has nothing to do with the most awesome only innovative phone that has come out in years.  It also easily attached to my smart tv so I can play videos etc.  Don't expect it to be a samsung or an iPhone, it operates differently, but in my opinion, much easier and convenient.  Every app I want is available, and the navigation works great!  Good job amazon.  I have had Droids, Samsung G4, iPhone 5, LG....and I love my fire phone
I really like my phone and I also purchased one for my husband. He enjoys his new Fire as well. I find it very easy to use and the panoramic feature is excellent. I also like the fire fly, because it's very convenient. Thank you Amazon.
After reading all the reviews on this phone before purchasing it....I have to say this phone is simply amazing! I did recieve mine with the new version downloaded in it to work out some of the pass bugs that was happening with the phone via other customers. I'm still working on some of the apps and ect that came with the phone, but now everything that I'm using is working GREAT!!! The only change that I'd like to see is having the volume louder when making a call. Even while using the speakerphone to talk, it's not very loud and Yes, I do have the volume turned all the way up. So Amazon increase the volume speaker and I'd say this phone is absolutely FABULOUS~~!!!!
I accidendly enabled something on my phone, which meant every time I clicked on an app or did anything on the phone it would start talking and telling how the app works! However , I did not know how to disable it, let alone know what it is.<br/><br/>But then I rememberd that the phone came with a built in feature called mayday! I had never used it before but when I did I wish I had. They were able to talk you through what has gone wrong and how to fix in in the future, whilst repairing your phone for you!!<br/><br/>I was so amazed, and pleased with the amazing free service! Hope fully it will be able to help in the future!<br/><br/>Thanks again amazon!
After 1 week of using, I ended up returning it. In my opinion I think Amazon phone is really good phone for whom were already bored with original Android platform or iOS. I like the User Interface (because it's new and only Amazon offers it).<br/>And sadly that is all I can say how much I like it. Here come the cons:<br/>1. If I am who in charge in this product. I would immediately deny or disagree with "Dynamic Perspective" project. This project is just for fun, for kids for teenagers and not for adults who shop on Amazon. Waste of time and battery killer. I played with it for like 1 hour then turned it off right away.<br/>2. 4 more cameras in the front? Oh man if those cameras just for Dynamic Perspective and cost more money then it's just piece of trunk. Sorry but I have to say garbage.<br/>3. Firefly is a good starter and not stable not accurate right now.<br/>4. Pricy very pricy. For that money I would wait for iPhone 6 incoming next month.<br/><br/>Conclusion: sorry Amazon. If you want to try it, go ahead and buy it. You have 14 days to try because I know for sure you will return it.<br/><br/> 3 stars are right and fair game. Would get 4 stars if the price is not that high. For that price Amazon can not compete with other known well-make smartphone companies out there.
I love this phone. Previously had iPhones and wanted something with more storage without paying an arm and a leg. I already had Amazon and audible accounts so this just made sense for me.<br/>Downfalls: I did turn off the dynamic perspective. While really neat, it made me nauseous. I do not like the placement of the camera button. I turn it on all the time just holding my phone. You can only download Amazon apps so some major apps that I used on a regular basis cannot be easily downloaded. (Starbucks my bank etc)<br/>The firefly feature is really neat and fun to play with. Plenty of storage. Easy to use. Love this and would recommend this to anyone.
Love this phone. A lot like my kindle. Very easy to learn to use. Would like to see more popular apps available.
We've had our phones for about a week and they've been really great! Very responsive touch screen, which I appreciate. It does what I need it to do quickly. Since it is a first generation phone, it is a little glitchy every once in a while. I had to restart my phone once because the screen went black when I tried to open Facebook. I'm not a heavy app user, but all of the apps I've downloaded and used have been great. I've run across one app that I had on my iPhone that isn't on here (space team), other then that everything I want is there. The phone does heat up a bit if you're watching a movie or videos for a while, nothing that worries me, but enough to notice. The battery life is decent, it could last me all day if I used my phone a lot, but it is dead by the end of the day if that happens. Camera is great. The four cameras that keep track of where your face is are cool but have no real use as of yet. I imagine that there could be some really awesome uses in future generations. I was pleasantly surprised by a 'siri' on this phone that is really good. All in all, pretty great phone. I wouldn't buy it at full price, but I'm cheap. We got these for a dollar each when we switched to AT&T.;
I love my Fire Phone. I wasn't sure if I would because of some of the other reviews. I got it at my ATT store a couple of weeks ago. This is my first smartphone. I have the Kindle Fire so the screen has many similarities and that made it easy for me. The Mayday button is great if I have any questions. The camera takes good pictures. I love the way things sync between my phone and my Kindle. The talk to text feature is excellent. So many of them on other phone mess up what you say but the Fire Phone does not! I am still discovering new things and learning about my phone but I would recommend it to anyone.
the mayday feature is good but I can't get the music, video,and prime music to work. The tech passed the problem on and I was supposed to have been contacted by Tuesday and it is now Friday and nothing.
Best smart phone for the money, but a little tricky to handle.  The motion opened menus take a lot of getting used to, but they are a very clever idea.  Superior graphics.  Great sound quality.  Main reasons I purchased this particular phone are the price (99 cents) and the free year of Amazon Prime (which keeps me from spending $99 to renew it).  This is a really good phone for the money.  I am not a power phone user - in fact, I really don't use it for much more than an alarm clock which can occasionally make phone calls and take pictures.  For those functions, it more than meets my needs.
If you are on the fence about the Amazon Fire Phone, I encourage you to "leap" forward! The Amazon Fire phone has been a lot of phone.....very user friendly...all the coolest apps are preloaded. Using the camera was soo easy, I felt like a pro! SUPER GREAT PICS and VIDEO production!!<br/><br/>Access to Amazon Prime movies is a plus, video streaming is excellent, along with great sound quality!!!  The Amazon Fire lets do everything I want to do, with complete ease! Take my word for it, buy this phone!! Get off the fence, and come on over and have some fun with the Amazon Fire phone.
In reality, not at all.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Price when considering the free year of Prime<br/>Brilliant Screen<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Everything else on the phone does not operate as well the iPhone 5s.  Nothing!<br/>The surround sound speakers have a poor frequency response range.  The one iPhone speaker sounds better.<br/>Firefly is a gimic, I have bar code reading apps for my iPhone which work just as well.<br/>Dynamic perspective seemed nothing like in the promo video where I thought I'd get a 3D like experience.  Instead it provides a 2D picture which changes perspective.  No part of the image provides a sense of depth.<br/>The speaker phone function uses the ear piece speaker and is simply not loud enough to use it hands free.<br/>And the straw that broke the camel's back for me was the Amazon app store.  It's so difacult to search and find something related to your search terms.<br/>The camera, worse in low light when compared to iPhone 5s.<br/><br/>In summary, I returned the phone, had it on and active for a grand total of 10 hours.  I had upgraded my grandfather'd AT&T; account in order to get this phone, I only hope AT&T; will restore my account once the return is verified.  I'm very disatisfied and disapointed as I really like Amazon and wanted to enter their "Eco" system a little deepr than just a Prime membership.  I am also a little befuddled by the fact I couldn't post a review the day after I received the phone, I can only imagine Amazon was aware of issues and concerned user's posting about known issues would discourage other buyers, but that's my own $.02.
Excellent. Basically a Kindle Fire HD with phone. Excellent display. Superb instant customer service.
I have had an Amazon fire phone for a year now I am very happy with it I had one small problem which they took care of extremely quick. I have had iPhones and Galaxy phones and I am happiest with this Amazon fire Phone. With an iPhone if you have a problem you have to go to one of their stores or online and you talk to five different people that have five different ideas. With the fire phone you go to Mayday and you have direct contact with the person they take your phone over and correct the problem and show you how to correct it as they're doing it.
I read so many reviews... Personally I really like this phone. I have had no problems. I'm still learning as of now. Some their is no pleasing and some everything is always good. I would like to make the font bigger in the text messaging. Maybe you can, I just have not figured it out. The camera is great. The speed is great. I have a few apps and they seem to be just fine. The battery is great. I had so many issues with my I-phone I was ready to go back to a flip top Nokia.. So I guess I fall into the category of "everything is good :-)"....
Before buying this phone you need to do your research and figure out the apps you REALLY need. You will definitely won't need all 1.3 millions apps in the other app stores, so don't be fooled by the numbers. Yes, Amazon App store is not as big as the other Big 2, but it has some useful apps. I've been an Apple user and a Samsung Galaxy S3, S5 user, and so far this phone is up to par with those other. It is fun and most important it is DIFFERENT. Remember that Amazon will make its app store as big as the other ones in time; and the benefits of DP, peek, and the others extra features will make for some fun and unique way to interact with the phone. Also, Amazon's latest software update has improve the battery life of this device and the Google apps everybody is complaining about..well there are work around those. I recommend to try the phone before judging it. You can even get it and if you don't like you can return it within 14 days and exchange it for something else at AT&T.; Play with it and experience something different.
I've had this phone for a few days now. I bought the unlocked version and set it up with my straight talk account. As far as phones go, this one is pretty sweet. Add on the free year of prime and it's easily the best deal on the market right now as far as value and quality go. My only complaint is how quickly the battery dies, but all the pros definitely outweigh that one con. It loads webpages flawlessly and let's me easily navigate between all of my apps with just a swipe of a button or a flick of my wrist. I am very satisfied with this phone.
This is my first smartphone, but i have knowledge of how other smartphones like iPhone and Samsung galaxy work and some of their features and capabilities. I just looked at the Fire phone without any bias or unrealistic expectations.<br/>I really love this phone, it is just perfect for what i need. I was a little hesitant to get this phone after reading so many bad reviews, but i don't regret my decision to get it one bit. I feel like it is completely under-rated, and that perhaps people that left all those bad reviews were biased because they where used to other smartphones and their operating systems.<br/>The camera on this phone is probably the best one i have ever seen on a mobile phone.<br/>The navigation on the phone is smooth and quick, the back feature took me a bit to get used to, but now i love it, i even find myself trying to swipe the same way on my ipad to go back like on this phone, that's how quick and natural it started feeling.<br/>All in all for me this phone is great, and I love it
This phone has worked really well for me so far! Customer service is excellent and the operating system is user friendly. The only disappointment is the battery life but I guess that's a problem plaguing smartphones of all stripes. Since I already use so many of existing Amazon services, the Fire phone turned out to be a great fit.
I bought this phone because I have so much amazon content (books, music, games, video, etc.) already and didn't want a smart phone that wouldn't give me access to it, and friends advised that the Kindle app for Iphones only works for books.  This is my first smartphone and I love it.  The camera function is great, Mayday is super helpful, and I've been able to run all the apps I want.  I do find I have to charge it pretty often, but I use it a lot, so I think that's fair.  I'm surprised it isn't doing better with customers--mine is great!
I was more than a little nervous about trying this phone after reading some of the reviews but I'm so happy I took a chance on it.  (I was definitely swayed by the free year of prime)  Navigation takes a little getting used to but it's really second nature now.  I love the camera which was also a deciding factor when I purchased this phone.  Limited apps can be a little bit of an issue but most of the ones I've wanted are available and hopefully more apps will continue to be added to the Amazon app store.  Overall, I love my Fire phone!
I love this phone!  It took a bit to adjust to a new phone, but doesn't it always?  I love the way it automatically connects my photos to Amazon Cloud!  I love the extra memory!  The camera is pretty good. The battery life is not bad, even after a year of use. I have a Kindle Fire HD 6, and I sync my books and audible account to both the Kindle and my phone. That way I can pick up wherever I left off, no matter which device is handy. The only wish I could make is that Amazon used a compatible OS so all android apps would work on it.
I think the phone will be great, but I have been on the phone with att for 3 hours and still can not get my numbers ported. I finally gave up and asked where the closest att store was. I am taking all 4 phones to them and see if they can straighten out the problem. One phone has the number ported but all calls are going to my old phone. The other phone has a totally new number and is the most important. I have got to have that number ported if nothing else. I will update later if they get things straightened out.
I know this phone didn't get the best reviews from various online reviews, but after owning the phone for a few weeks and getting to know it better I realized that those reviewers either didn't know what they were talking about or had a heavy iPhone bias.<br/><br/>I have really started to like this phone way more then my previous iPhone.  Once you get used to the controls and configure it the way that works for you it becomes very initiative and a feature packed experience.  I was already married to the Amazon environment so the transition for me was seem less.  It should be noted that I made that choice while owning an iPhone.  In other words iTunes sucks!<br/><br/>Amazon has been nothing but a pleasure to work from a product and customer service standpoint.  The Amazon app store has everything I've needed and haven't had any problems.  I'm extremely happy with this phone and look forward to owning it for the next two years and beyond.
Ok, so I bought this phone as a Christmas present for my husband.  Previously he had an iPhone.  He really wanted this phone.  On 12/29 he went to activate the phone.  First mistake....I bought the phone in early December (remember it was to be a Vhristmas present) and I was transferring his number to the new phone.  BIG mistake...AT&T; actually activated his service the day I bought it, not the day I received it (6 days later) nor the day I called to activate it, 12/29.  So forward fast to CHRISTMAS.  Busy time, so we finally got around to activating the phone.  WRONG!!! Even though it remained dead in the box until 12/29, the day we thought we were activating service, DING DONG, time was up on the 14 day buyer beware AT&T; says they give you to cancel your contract.  Now, the best part.  The phone worked for 8 HOURS and suddenly the Fire Phone no longer recognized the SIM card.  7 hours over the two days on the phone with Amazon support and AT&T;, and 90 minutes at the AT&T; store in person.......ZIP, NADA.  Back to Amazon support.  Explained everything only to be told that the brand new phone was defective.  Supposed to have a replacement phone 2 days later.......again NADA.  Back to  Amazon support......"oh I see there was a computer glitch," the replacement phone was never ordered.  Fully frustrated, I cancelled the replacement, asked for a full refund,  went back to Verizon (who I will never leave again), and bought an Android.  AMAZON:  my hubby really wanted this phone.  It's not ready for PRIME TIME.  Go back to the drawing table and release it when it has been fully tested and all aspects work properly.  Still a huge Amazon Prime customer and lover of every other aspect of Amazon (Echo, Kindle, Music).  AT&T;:  you suck.  The most ignorant reps I ever dealt with and outright fraud on the true 14 day Buyer Beware.  How can you begin the 14 day timeline of Buyer Beware before an item has been fully activated and tested?  They refused to expunge the cancellation fee of $325 and the initial service payment of $126.30.  Small Claims Courts love folks like me as defendants.
I am familiar with many different smart phones including the iphone's, Droids, Nexus and Galaxy devices. This phone is a great new entrant with some great features from what is becoming a very very good hardware company. Amazon has been making hardware for just a few years compared to Apple, LG, Motorola, Samsung, LG, Etc but there products are very solid, this one included. There are some things that could, and probably will be improved in later revisions of this product.<br/><br/>The price of this phone is a little expensive for an Android phone, but the base model does include a year of prime and 32GB of storage, which is double what a new iphone, galaxy or nexus phone comes with.<br/><br/>The weight and size of this phone are a little bit on the heavy side, but this phone feels very solid and neither are a deal breaker. The phone doesn't have the premium metal feel like a iphone 5s/or an HTC one, but once your case is on they all feel the same.<br/><br/>The screen is very good, the resolution and color are excellent. The 4.7 size in my opinion is just right. The 3D feature is really neat, but I am not sure that it will be that cool or helpful in the long run. Stay tuned for updates to this review in regards to the 3D feature set. I presume 3D will become a better feature once more apps are developed specifically for this phone.<br/><br/>The camera is very good and has been a joy to use. I am excited to use this with some of the different photo apps on the Amazon AppStore. I think I even prefer it to the iPhone camera.<br/><br/>The battery life is good to average for a comparable phone. Longer than the iPhone 5S for sure, the battery is 35% larger than an iPhone battery.<br/><br/>The new Fire OS for phone is nice and snappy to use. The OS is ok, like the original tablet OS it will be continually updated and shortly become a very polished product. One negative regarding the Fire OS is that the Google Play store isn't included for apps, everything must go thru the Amazon AppStore. The Amazon Appstore is great, and the free App a day is a great discovery tool, but it is nice to have the breadth of the Google Play catalog.<br/><br/>Overall this isn't the greatest smartphone ever released, but it is definitely a great first smartphone for Amazon. Especially for users who are heavy users of all Amazon's offerings(Prime, Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, Etc.)It is great that Amazon didn't just make "another smartphone" with like specs but made revolutionary steps like dynamic perspective. If Dynamic Perspective is improved over the years then you will see other phone makers imitating this feature.
My device reviews are normally pretty technical- but I can't do that here. I bought this as an early bday gift for my husband. He had his previous phone (htc inspire) for years and it was cumpling befor my eyes. My husband is very much the 'if it ain't broke' type... except he's more like, 'if it ain't broke enough'. So when his nexus tablet bit the dust after a fall onto a hard floor I started looking for something that could give him the same function as tablet and phone in a closs to phone size (he doesn't like galaxys, which are my own preference). This popped up in an email with a free year of prime and looked like it would fit the bill.<br/><br/>It does =) With prime he can watch shows and movies with it, plus the unlimited music streaming. The speakers aren't great but the included ear buds are amazing. He said it sounds like he's in a movie theater it's so crisp and clear. He loves the amazon appstore free app of the days and that's easily accessible on the phone. We had a worry spot because we use google calendar (with two boys with a genetic disorder we have to have their myriad appts straight), but we were able to find a calendar that synced to google, so crisis abated. His one complaint is there is no camera app. He doesn't always remember the camera button- but that will just take acclimation.<br/><br/>I've played with it a bit and admit this phone would not be my personal choice. There are too many limitations and I've always felt that the Amazon version of android was barely android. However, for someone like my husband this phone is nearly perfect. It gives him all the easy functionality of media, camera (13mp) and basic web surfing without much hassle.
This is my 4th cell phone; 2nd smart phone. I've had verizon prepaid for a kryocea and LG flip. Went to a nokia windows phone with t-mobile, and now have the Fire with ATT.  I typically don't buy the first model of anything, but I did this time. What sold me is Amazon customer service; it cannot be beat. Also I have had numerous Kindles (give them as gifts) without any issues. Honestly, I haven't taken the time to explore all of the features, but I'll get there eventually. I'm looking forward for some more slick games that take advantage of the dynamic perspective. Only issue I have with phone was random (two occasions) rapid battery discharge, and customer service has resolved that issue.  With the new 0.99 price, year of prime, and support - I'd highly recommend the phone if you're like me and just getting into the smart phone market.
DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO BAD REVIEWS !<br/>This is where they're all coming from, GREENPEACE is on a mission, all these bad 1-star reviews are from greenpeace people who haven't even purchased the phone. Why is it that people are allowed to write a public review when they haven't even purchased the product ?? This is just WRONG. Read below, this is directly from the greenpeace website, full instruction on how to write a bad review,and as you can see this phone is flooded with them. Completely insane.<br/><br/>"Thank you for telling Amazon’s Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos to finally come clean about his company’s energy performance and environmental impact. Making this information public is the first step to getting Amazon to clean up its act.<br/><br/>And the more the company hears from its customers, the quicker it will happen. Let's take this to the next level by talking to Amazon in the one language we absolutely know it understands: product reviews!<br/><br/>HELP flood Amazon.com with 1-star reviews for their first ever smartphone, the Amazon Fire.<br/><br/>Why the Fire? The recently released Fire phone’s major boast is its unlimited cloud data storage ... but there’s a BIG catch. Unlike Apple’s iCloud which is powered by 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power.<br/><br/>Amazon’s Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary. Storing our photos, music and messages shouldn’t mean we are forced to damage the health of our climate and communities. Apple, Facebook, and Google have figured out how to store our photos and music with renewable energy, and so can Amazon. These reviews will show Amazon that it’s time to move to modern energy sources and make a “smarter phone” supported by clean, renewable energy.<br/><br/>Do you have an Amazon.com account? Great! Now, take these TWO easy steps to tell Amazon to shape up:<br/><br/>Number 1Copy the following review (or just write your own):<br/><br/>It’s time to put out the Fire! It makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud is not a strong selling point, especially when competitors like Apple are using 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon can commit to using modern energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.<br/><br/>Number 2Click HERE to leave a 1-star review on the Amazon Fire Phone product page:<br/>Pssst … don't forget to click "one" star when you paste your review. And you may need to log into your Amazon.com account first before accessing the review page.<br/><br/>Thank you again for taking action. Time and time again we’ve seen that your support makes a big difference in getting companies like Amazon to embrace better policies. As an Amazon.com customer, it’s important they hear from you directly.<br/><br/>For a greener internet and future,<br/><br/>David Pomerantz<br/>Greenpeace USA Senior Energy Campaigner<br/><br/>P.S.

I'm enjoying this phone so far. Wish it would work better with Android. Couple apps that are only in android market that I would like. Otherwise phone is solid in performance. Operates quick and performs well. Video quality is awesome. Been able to sync my gmail email to phone and have gotten all my contacts from my Google account. Glad to say the negative reviews are mostly wrong and people just expecting it to be another Samsung or HTC phone.
Got this phone a little over a month ago, switching from an iPhone, and I do not regret it at all. The Fire phone is so easy to use and  it does everything I need it to do. The voice calls are super loud, as is the ringer. I have no complaints at all.
I'm very happy with my new Amazon Fire Phone, with 64GB. The phone is sleek, very easy to set up and use.  The camera functions beautifully.  I'm a long time Apple iPhone owner, and I'm thrilled to have finally cut loose from such an expensive phone. With the year of Prime added to my current membership, the savings is already incredible. And considering that I can trade in the iPhone right here on Amazon for a hefty amount....well that's just icing on the cake.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Sleek and clean style<br/>Easy to set up<br/>Very cost efficient for me<br/>Has everything that I need in a Smart phone<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>I don't have access to a kazillion apps like I did on the iPhone.  Oh yeah, I downloaded or purchased so many apps and use less than a 1/4 of the apps on the iPhone.<br/>Won't have my phone syncing to my iPad anymore.  Well I do love my Kindle Fire HD.<br/><br/>Give Amazon a chance, people, and stop throwing away your money on the next best thing. The iPhone 6+ is undoubtedly a great phone, and my AT&T; store was packed today with people struggling to pay bills but determined to spend $300-$500 on that new phone. And while the plus has a great battery life and nice camera features (not found on the 6 by the way), I'm pretty sure it won't fit in my pockets or purse.  I could perhaps look for an armband, but then I'd have to build up my biceps.  Hey this Amazon Fire Phone is great!
Switched from an IPhone to the Fire Phone and was pleasantly surprised.  The motion features are nice and all but I run my phone with low motion settings.  The phone operates very smooth and navigation is extremely easy.  Only downfall is the lack of some major applications (youtube for example) but numerous third party equivalents make up for those.  Overall it is a very nice phone and I would definitely recommend it.
I have had better phones and the one I replaced was by far inferior to the Fire. I understand the frustration with not having certain Apps from the Google and Android Libraries, however, like the Soldier I was all my adult life I have adapted and drive on. I find my new phone to be more and more user friendly as I get to understand it, use it and just explore the variances from this platform to others. Of course ALL phones have room for improvement, but I would rather have a phone that is not too overloaded than one that is far too short on functions.<br/>I personally like my Fire and I would recommend it to anyone if they want to try something new and different. If you are one of those Blackberry faithful or only like the Samsung Galaxy it is not for you. However, I still have an iPhone and I use both with equal confidence and enjoy them for what each offers.<br/>This is the first attempt and those always have some shortfalls, however, I like jumping in where others may fear to tread. That is why I was in the SF and Infantry not the Finance Office and Mess Hall. But hey, that is me. I like mine, you try it if you want and you decide. Until next time, I hope my objective point of view helps and not hinders anyone's decision to buy this phone or no. I like mine, perhaps you will too or not. But that is for you to decide. Thank you.

It's a very easy to use phone.  With the May day app. Any question you have is immediately answered by your own Tec person.<br/>.
I love this phone, don't agree with a lot of other reviews I've read about it. It's great in many ways! I've seen a lot of complaints about navigation through this phone & I completely disagree, the swipe maneuvering is so simple & nice, I really love this phone!! The only thing I would change is the apps that are available through Amazon, many I want are not an option but overall very happy with this phone :)
I love this phone. I've had every version of iPhone until the 6. I thought it was too expensive for what it is, so I decided to try the Amazon Fire phone. I'm glad I did. Everything works well on it. Don't let other reviews talking about not being able to load certain Google apps dissuade you - it is possible to have them on your Fire phone, you just need to search the Internet to figure out how.
We are an older couple and this is our first smartphone.  This is not a technical review.  This is the best sounding (speaking & listening) phone of any cellular phone we've ever owned.  The size seems perfect.  The screen is big enough to see, but the phone is not too bulky to handle.  My husband was afraid the keyboard for texting would be too small, but he is pleased that he can actually use it.  So far I have used the GPS, camera and firefly and have been pleased.  We are pleased enjoying the device and exploring its many applications.  We are also happy we waited for this one as many of its predecessors were only half baked by comparison.
I like the phone it's takes some getting used to but I always expect that.. Amazon did and amazing job with the dynamic perspective.. It's even a little sleepy how it follows your eyes on the lock screen.. the only cons is it doesn't have some apps I want.. and there is not led indicator for texts and notifications.. both minor problems but over all well done Amazon.
I have used this phone for 2 months and am very satisfied. Keep unwanted apps deleted off the homepage and the battery is satisfactory.I like how the homepage is a widget for my text, notes and calendar. I think most negative reviews are from people who don't give themself time to get used to it. Would give it 5 stars but the camera is only average.
There are a lot of apps that I used on my previous phone that are not available in the Fire Phone app store. There is no Target Cartwheel app, Bank of America app (?!?!) are the two biggest ones that are not available and I really want to use. It syncs with my Kindle Fire, which is nice. It is a fast phone and usually loads everything quickly.
(Revised 2014-08-28)<br/><br/>I will start by saying that I am an Amazon Enthusiast; I love Amazon services and how the phone integrates with them.  Before the Fire Phone I had a Samsung Galaxy 3, and have also had iPhones and Blackberries in the past.  I have had the FirePhone for over a month now and like it.<br/><br/>The phone is well polished.  All of the stock programs (email, contacts, calendar, camera, weather, messaging, phone, photos, as well as the "settings" menu) are all extremely well done and are **better** than the corresponding stock Android programs.  I use these programs the most, which is why I will say this phone is better than a Galaxy or other stock Android phones.  In particular, the email, camera, and weather programs are a great deal better than the corresponding stock Android programs.  (In particular, email search on the FirePhone is better than on my Galaxy which increases my productivity.)  The camera is extremely handy, one-button access even when the phone is locked, and picture quality is very good.  Similarly, FireFly is great and can be accessed via button from a locked phone -- I use it frequently for music identification (Shazam / SoundHound) when I might not have time to both unlock the phone and get to the right app on my Galaxy.  It also reads QR codes (in addition to just about everything else).<br/><br/>The Maps program is better than I initially thought it might be.  Competition here is quite high, as the stock Android navigation program is extremely good as well.  Amazon's "Maps" program has destination search (ie, search for "Space Needle" instead of typing in an address), including voice search that works well.  This makes it comparable to Android's "Maps" program, and possibly better than Apple's.  The UI for Amazon's Maps program is more aesthetic than using Google's navigation, and similarly provides turn-by-turn directions.  The quality of directions seems fine to me over a few dozen journeys where I have used it, although I suspect that the Android directions are better due to greater usage and thus more data to feed back into their system.  I can say that Amazon's "Maps" does not cover all of (or any of?) Europe, as the stock Android navigation program does.<br/><br/>The look & feel of the FirePhone is as well polished as the stock applications.  The UI is not as configurable as an Android phone, but given how well things work, that is just fine with me.  I was not excited about having to configure the Galaxy to get rid of junk programs -- no need to do that on the FirePhone.  Scrolling and general device navigation seems better than on other Android phones, basically on par with an iPhone.  I find the FirePhone to be more fun to pick up and use than a Galaxy.  Kind of like an iPhone in this respect, but without being locked into the over-restrictive iPhone ecosystem.  Voice dictation for text entry works *really* well -- better than on my Android phone which is surprising.  I use this a lot.<br/><br/>The Amazon Music, Video, Books/Kindle, and Audible applications all work well, using these on the FirePhone is simply better than on a Galaxy.<br/><br/>The phone hardware itself is aesthetic - the dimensions, color, finish, etc all look good.  The screen dimensions are just narrow enough that I can reach everything with my left thumb.  The Fire Phone is a few millimeters thicker than the Galaxy, perhaps one minor thing to make the device seem clunky (particularly with a case).  The device is a few grams heavier than other phones as well, but that doesn't bother me.<br/><br/>The camera program is also a significant step up from the Galaxy 3.  It is fast to load and generally responsive, and the colors look better to my eye.  I was able to take multiple photos per second by pressing the shutter button successively, and I love that the program is always available by clicking the button on the side of the phone.<br/><br/>A few key tips that I learned:<br/>* There is no physical "back" button, but you can do the same thing by swiping up from the bottom of the screen.  This, in combination with the "home" button, work well together.<br/>* By default the device has a "clean" look with very few characters, no time or battery indicators listed.  Tilt the device to one side or the other to make these widgets show up - this is one example of how Dynamic Perspective helps to make the device clean looking and fun to use.  I ended up going into Settings to turn "on" the display bar (Settings | Display), so that I always see the time and battery level.  (Use Mayday if you want help configuring this.)<br/>* Tap the button twice quickly to scroll through active applications.  Swipe applications up to close them.<br/>* "Mayday" is always available.  I LOVE THIS!!  Any time I have a question about the phone, an Amazon is one click away from answering it.  This is a bold move by Amazon.  If my Galaxy had this functionality I would have used it continuously to complain about a ton of minor glitches.  As I remarked earlier, the Amazon phone is better polished than the Galaxy which makes it possible for Amazon to provide this superior level of support.<br/>* When you shake the phone, it goes to the settings menu.  I turned this off ("Configure low motion settings" from the "Display" menu, or just use Mayday to ask an Amazon agent).  This messed up my jogging program... I would look down and see "Settings" instead of my exercise progress.<br/><br/>To be sure, there are a few kinks along the way - here is what I have found so far:<br/>1.  I could not find Prime Playlists in the default Amazon Music app.  I used Mayday to ask where it is - they had me download a different application called "Amazon Prime Music" from the app store.  It is not integrated with my music, but this is a newer program for Amazon and I imagine they will fix it in the next few months.<br/>2.  Some programs are not available in Amazon's app store.  For a few of these, I was able to move the program over to the Kindle Phone from my Galaxy as follows:  (1) install an "APK Extractor" program on the Galaxy, (2) choose the program to move over and extract it, (3) email the APK ("*.apk") file to the FirePhone as an attachment, (4) get the email on the FirePhone and click on the attachment to install it.  This may not work for all programs, particularly those that utilize Google's services, but it does work for many of them.<br/>3.  The phone gets hot with heavy use.<br/>4.  At one point I lost my GPS signal while using the Maps program -- I assume that the phone got hot and thus turned off this energy-hogging-heat-generating functionality -- but it was not entirely clear for sure this was the cause.  Just happened once on a hot day while the camera was in the sunny dashboard of my car.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm quite happy with the phone.
It was finally time to dump my old iPhone 4S. I researched many of the leading options and was impressed by the hardware found in the Fire Phone. The price was right so I bought it. After enjoying the gimicky "Peek" and "Dynamic Perspective" features for a day or so. I found myself disabling them for good. They weren't useful or even reliable.<br/>Had that been my only disapointment, I would have written off that part and kep tthe phone. Unfourtunately, Amzon missed the mark in creating their own flavor of Android OS. The exclusion of the Google Play store was annoying at first but became downright frustrating as I found the Amazon Appstore versions of many apps were missing key features found in the Google Play versions. Some of the features (like the "scan" option for the eBay app) were advertised as a feature in the Amazon App Store but not found in the app.<br/>Firefly was useful if you wanted to lookup a product... but only on Amazon. The feature is quick to recognize barcodes but then only lets you search in Silk for a match.<br/>I ran some side-by-side tests on the Fire Phone and my old iPhone 4S. Both are on the AT&T; network. My iPhone consistantly receives Twitter, email, and eBay notifications 5-10 MINUTES before my Fire Phone. I could complete an email conversation using my iPhone with several back and forth emails before the Fire Phone ever notified me of the first incoming email.<br/>The MayDay feature is helpful but the operators (while friendly) couldn't even explain how to close a background app without a 7 step process involving jumping through the settings menu, manage applications, hunting for the app, then forcing it to quit by overiding the warning. I found on my own that simply double-clicking the home button and swiping up on an application icon did the trick.<br/>If you like auto-scrolling to simplify reading lengthy web pages, the tilt to scroll feature is nice. I just wish I could shut it off for when I have to set the phone down for a second. Whooosh!!!! I am instantly at the end of the site!<br/>This phone is going back to the store... and I am going back to looking for a real phone.
Top Things Liked: Swipe-able UI , Amazon apps (Kindle, Audible), Mayday (Tech Support) and Low Cost. Bottom Things: Battery life and heat. Undetermined: Dynamic Perspective - gimmick or hidden gem?<br/><br/>I prefer this phone over the Android and Apple phones because it has a unique top layer that allows swipe action and gives visibility into the emails and texts messages, without having to tap into those features themselves. Double tap for quick switch is also nice touch for quick access. There are also some left tilt, right tilt actions which are handy, but i still have to get used to them. The screen is as big as iPhone 6 by the way. I do agree with most people that Dynamic Perspective is a little gimmicky (to me, as a short time user for now).<br/><br/>I also have a lot of kindle books and audiobooks i like to read and listen to. I went to the ATT store to try out. I found reading books ok on the FIRE but not good on iphone 5 (too narrow and insufficient) and the financial incentives are very attractive. If you factor the free 1year's worth of PRIME, which I would pay anyway, my effective cost is really low. The downside of this phone is battery life. It is warm when the phone is one for a while and drains quite rapidly. I have not had it for a long time to give more info on this. However, (1) they made sure native Amazon apps like kindle and audible remain battery sipping. (2) once the screen is off, the phone cools equally rapidly. So, i shut the display down as often as i can help it.<br/><br/>Finally, their Tech Support is superior - It is done through a custom app called MAYDAY and it basically allows their reps to remote login to the phone and i was able to figure a lot of stuff out with their help. I would say "i want to get rid of recommendations" and they show me how to do it. It beats having to haul into the mall and make an appointment to see a genius.<br/><br/>My previous phone were webOS phones, which i found quite intuitive with their swipe actions at the time. Fire is a decent 3rd candidate in the land of android and apple. I was sick of carrying around the kindle (touch) and then a phone and headphones and charger etc. To me, kindle and audible are not going away from my lifestyle anytime soon, so having a single device that takes care of all that is useful. The large screen makes Kindle reading ok by the way. It has tech support (what a novel idea!!) and a decent camera, email and such works as well as any of the other candidates. Free PRIME and zero down makes it all the more compelling.<br/><br/>The business with Hachette not withstanding. If you read/listen to a lot kindle content, you should take a look at this.
I would only use this phone as a door stop. But you can sideload google play and Google apps into the phone. If you do that it's a great phone. I hope Amazon realizes they're missing out on so many potential customers but limiting the phone only to Amazon. For non tech savvy people they're probably not going to love it.
Has been a good phone, and like the display.<br/>Left the Android world for this, and not for any real reason than just was time.  And liked how they did things with other whom have one.<br/>Would like to see some of the same apps, since Amazon still seems to be lacking in some areas, but for me not a deal breaker.
This is the best phone I have! I have used the IPhone, Samsung, and Windows smartphones, NONE of these phones comes close to the Kindle Fire phone!!! Waiting for the new Kindle Fire phone to come out? Every feature on this phone out does the others' browsers, excels in  clarity, and sound with all its features!
4 days in! Love the feel and look of the Amazon Fire! Wish the protective case came out the same day. However, it appears that it would be difficult to scratch the Fire.  Had an Iphone and an HTC. While both were excellent, I do a lot of shopping through amazon, read a host of books on my Kindle and watch prime almost daily. So this was an easy switch for me. The picture quality is excellent. Still working on learning what all this phone can do. But for now, glad I made the switch. Update. There are way to many products blend with this phone. Some make no sense at all. Say your phone is off and you receive a message. You will have to call your voicemail to find out. That is so 1991. Next, you want to save your boarding pass, no can't do that either. I have to go back to an iPhone fast.
My wife has finally given up her old flip phone and joined the I-phone generation, and she couldn't be happier with her choice.  Ordering was trouble-free, delivery was trouble free, and set-up and activation was quick easy and trouble free. We are very happy with our choice.
I loved the phone however could not get service from at&t; locally because I purchased from Amazon. I spent over 5 days trying to receive calls and all they said was you have to wait, we can't help. I wish the phone was thru another service. I really loved the easy way the Fire phone could be set up.
For $200 this is a great phone.  I bought one to use in Europe as I am on Sprint and had a lot of problems with my Samsung Galaxy phones while there.  We have both the Samsung Galaxy S4 and Note 2.  Two Galaxy S4s did not work while in France anywhere ever after unlocking International and agreeing to the $2/min or $1/min cost.  French SIM cards didn't work either.  So next time I saw this phone on sale for $200 dollars, I snapped it up.<br/><br/>Going to Europe just got a lot simpler. In Italy in Spring we popped in our Italian nano SIM and we had 20cent/min calling.  Until this we would charge up our old Motorola Photon phones and use the GSM only feature.  The Photons no long hold a charge and never worked quite right in Italy, it always tried to ask to go Global which meant searching for Sprint service which... doesn't exist there.  Killer on the battery.  So now, yes, I carry two phones and so does my husband.<br/><br/>After using it in Europe, I started learning the interface and became enamored with the desktop and swipe/tilt features.  It is very easy to use.  It plays all my games without complaint.  That it doesn't come with Google apps is a set back but since I'm Amazon Prime I get a lot out of the phone in other ways.  After Spring, I ordered a second phone when it went on sale for $189 and got another year of Prime (I love Prime).  With the phone I can download the prime streaming for 48 hours to watch while offline.  While traveling to Europe, this was great for my daughter on the plane.  On the ride back I bought a few seasons of favorites and downloaded them for the flight home.  This was not possible with my Galaxy phones as Amazon doesn't support them. (Or didn't at the time)<br/><br/>For a good, quick responding phone that I can use in Europe, and play games and videos easily, $200 was an incredible price and getting Prime for a year, really brought the price to $100 because I would've renewed like always, it is a steal.  I bought a second a few months after the first and am very happy with it.  Too bad that discontinued the phone.  I would've upgraded.  I have seriously thought about switching from Sprint and using this phone.
I am torn between 3 and 4 stars.  I do love Amazon and really want this phone to be more awesome.  However, I like it much more than my iphones and if I leave the Fire I will explore HTC or another Androidish phone.  I have had 2 Fire phones - One I bought unlocked, and one that was sent to me refurbished as my first one had some issues.  The 2nd one did too and I'm waiting on my third.  They have made replacing the phone very simple though and, as always, customer service is polite and actually timely and helpful.<br/>As I also use this phone as my home and work number, not having a reliable phone is very problematic.  (and my IT department does not love supporting it)  I will say that I love so many things about the Fire Phone, but there are definately fixes that are needed based on my experience with 2 phones.  These may be issues with the physical phones that I have had which would be bad luck, or issues with the programs:<br/><br/>Problems or suggestions:<br/>1) the speaker phone is very low and almost unusable.  As music or videos will play louder, I do not think this is a speaker issue, but something about when the phone is on a call.  therefore I have to use a bluetooth speaker for conference calls or anytime I need to be on speaker.<br/>2) the maps need a lot of suggestions, but when I try the swipe left - I don't get a screen to report a problem, but rather it just moves the map.  A lot of pins are wrong.  A lot of roads seem misaligned.  However - I love the ability to tilt for extra information.<br/>3) The map should have an ability to lock on the compass at ALL times, it drives me nuts when the turn by turn directions switch - especially as the maps have a tendancy to believe I have gotten off the road and wants me to make a big loop.  It is difficult to see the whole trip the way I would like as it Zooms in automatically with no way to adjust how much of the map I would like to see.<br/>4) I do not think the Calendar syncs correctly with Outlook.  And the day view is difficult to see as it starts early in the morning and you can't see the whole day but just a few hours.  It would be better smaller or give you an option to pick the viewable hours.<br/>5) The apps don't show alerts - like facebook or words with friends.  You have to open them to see any alerts.  And it doesn't have all the apps I would like.  Also, Amazon is good about showing me reccomendations on everything - except in the App store.  always open to a bunch of kiddie games that I would never download.<br/>6) The cloud doesn't let you automatically back up things like recordings or screen shots.  This would be huge to me.  However, it is easy enough to hook up to laptop and drag them into a folder or into the Amazon Cloud.<br/>7) I wish there was an easier lock for the scroll function - I love it - but there are times I am on the web and I move my hand and I am halfway down the screen or more.  Also - handing the phone to someone to look at something can trigger scroll - which is annoying. However - it is awesome for reading with one hand!!<br/>8) there isn't a great option for facetime replacement.  We try to use skype - but it's not always great.<br/>9) the face recogniton is great - however, the monkey feature doesn't 'see' little kid faces well.  My 3 year old loves her monkey friend - but I have to be there to look at him so he stays engaged.<br/>10) The camera was supposed to be better than the iphone - but I dont see that it is.  It is still pretty slow and I can't tell that resolution is better.  However, it isn't worse.  I am by no means a picture expert.  I do think that the front cameras capture a more realistic look for skype though - less huge nose or middle of the face spread like iphone.<br/>11) the photolocket is an AWESOME idea - but a little cumbersome to load pics into.  If there was an option, like the VIP for contact - or to choose multiple pics at a time that would be helpful.  Even if it added to the locker from the picture - but stayed in the pictures.  Or could load up the locket from the cloud.<br/>12) Contacts seems to duplicate people and numbers - not very easy to clean up.  I wish there was a hide - or easy way to group people better.<br/>13) after I switced from an IPhone - it took weeks for people to be able to text me again.  I blame Apple - they irritate me - but I do think a bettr fix on your end would help if people switch over.<br/>14) my IT department gives me flack about not supporting this phone and not having easy resources to debug issues.  (however, some of these issues may have been attributable to a defective phone.)<br/>15) when you receive a texted 'contact' from someone - you can't see who it is.  you have to know what name it saves under or scroll through your contacts until you find a new one.<br/><br/>Things I love:<br/>1) firefly is pretty cool.  I have used it shopping several times, found a better price with free shipping and had it delivered to my front door next day or added to Subscribe and Save.  I have not had good luck scanning business cards with it or flyers for certain events.<br/>2) I am an Amazon 'junky' who reads a ton and loves to shop with you first if the price justifies it (which it often does).  However, the shopping app could be better.<br/>3) I like that I can see categories of pictures by flicking to the left (or right)... is it my left or the phones left?<br/>4) I love love love that you can flip from cloud to device with a switch!!!  This is awesome - I love the Amazon Cloud. I hate Itunes.<br/>5) I love that I can plug the phone to my computer to pull off pics and files - however the folder organization is not as friendly as I would hope.  The camera pics are not in pictures but in some file called DCIM...<br/>6) It s great being able to access my attachements and docs easily for working away from the office.<br/>7) The screen is a great size and durable as far as I can tell.  Much better than the iphone screen. I never had an iphone screen for more than a couple months without a crack or break.  I have had the Fire for a year with NO scratching, breakage etc.<br/>8) I love that my charger is USB to Mini - I am so tired of proprietary chargers.  i would love the phone to hold a charge longer - or automatically clean up my poser usage becuase I have too many things going on my carosel.  however, the mini-usb means I can charge anywhere easily.<br/>9) I thought the voice recognition worked surprisingly well - I just need to train myself to use it more.  I kind wish there was just a button that you held down for voice (like a walkie talkie) so that I don't have to figure out if it is ready for me to speak, if I have to push a button to say I'm done etc.<br/>10) it used to allow me to open up Facebook like in Facebook or as a webpage - however I never see that option anymore.  I LOVED that option.  It let me e-mail myself articles I wanted to read later.<br/>11) It is very easy to back up and reload from that backup if you have to reset phone to factory or to use a new phone ( I have experienced this).  I never figured this out well with an iphone.<br/>10) Alarms work well and are easy to set.<br/>11) the carosel and the swip down 'control panel' are great!<br/>12) flipping right for pics when I'm texting is great!<br/>13) Mayday is usually great!<br/>14) I don't know what sync does - it's easy to find though<br/>15) all of the search optios are easy to use so I never have to remember where to find things like 'connect to a bluetooth device' - however I would like to pin some of my common processes to the swipedown menu<br/><br/>Overall - I would love to try to stick it out with the Fire phone - however I heard a disturbing rumor that several of the developing group was laid off and that maybe the phone would be phased out.  That would make me sad:(
I see that the Fire phone isn't currently available, and am wondering if Amazon will continue with it. I personally am not overly impressed. I waited more than six months to write the review because I don't think reviewing something 3 days after you get it is fair. As the 3-star rating indicates, "it's okay." It's got a smaller screen and is heavier and thicker than my previous phone. Some of the Android apps I used on my Samsung Galaxy (I had an s3) aren't available in the Amazon app store. The features they tout highly (dynamic perspective, Firefly, and the Mayday live customer service) are probably nice, but I almost never use them. (I did try the Firefly a couple of times with songs that came on the radio and it worked ok, but it's just not something I would use all the time.)<br/><br/>Performance...well, I find that the phone freezes up on a fairly regular basis--2-3x/week on average--and I have to restart it. I don't like that it doesn't have a back button and swiping to go back a screen within an app is clumsy and often results in going back to the home screen instead. I don't like that it doesn't have an alert light when I have a message or missed call or notification of some kind--at least not one I can find from searching through all the settings and help docs. Maybe I *should* try that Mayday and see...LOL I have to keep my phone on silent all day at work, so it's always nice to tell at a glance that I have a text.<br/><br/>I'm an Audible customer, and I do like that I download my audiobooks right the phone and listen...and ditto with the Kindle books. But of course there is a Kindle app for use with other phones that I could do the same thing with...and I think I would find this phone's screen too small to read on anyway.<br/><br/>In short, to me it is ok, but at my first opportunity I will switch back to a Samsung Galaxy (whatever number is available at the time.) I am not someone who uses the phone for everything, so it's not intolerable for me...I just don't like it nearly as well as my old phone. The free year of Prime it came with was great, but even if an upgraded version of this were available later, I'll skip it.
Brief Summary followed by explanation:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Fire phone excels as:<br/>1. Functioning as an Actual phone<br/>2. All forms of Media playback and web browsing<br/>3. Maps/Gps function<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>The only con I have found so far may simply be user error in that I'm not entirely sure if apps "fully close" when exiting, or may simply be differences in operating systems.<br/><br/>Overall functioning:<br/><br/>I find the Fire phone appears to outperform my Note 3 consistently & across all domains despite appearing to have "inferior" specifications on paper.<br/><br/>Additionally, the phone comes with a free year of Amazon Prime. Current Prime members also receive this bonus.<br/><br/>I nearly avoided this phone due to some of the bad reviews. I'm very thankful that I took a chance with this phone. I acquired the phone from an AT&T; store.<br/><br/>I took the time to go through the tutorial & I'm glad that I did. Navigating the fire phone is a unique experience compared to Android devices; however, I appreciate the break from conventional methods.<br/><br/>This phone has excellent call quality which I define by voice clarity & very low levels of "static" on the line.<br/><br/>I find the phone impressive as a media player in general. Both audio and video appear to be of a much higher quality when comparing the *exact same* media files, i.e. same resolution, etc, when playing on my Note 3 vs Fire phone.<br/><br/>The built in "Music" app takes a few seconds to load initially, then is very quick to navigate. My only issue is that accessing Prime Music requires downloading an additional app.<br/><br/>The Silk browser *drastically* outperforms Chrome, & the built in browser, on my Note 3.<br/><br/>The maps/ GPS functioning initially appears superior to Google maps in that it *doesn't* tAke forever to locate GPS signal, & I have yet to suddenly lose connection---which frequently happened to me using Google maps on my Note 3.<br/><br/>The screen on this phone is amazing with very good to excellent color clarity, depth, and is far easier to read than my previous Note 3. I am very impressed with the display in general, especially visibility in direct sunlight!<br/><br/>I am not a heavy app user, but do rely on gmail on a daily basis. I had zero issues using the built in "Email" app to access my Gmail account. I actually *prefer* the email app because my email presents by day vs by Google's predefined categories---which I personally dislike strongly enough to consider dropping Gmail entirely.
I love my Fire Phone.  I am very familiar with the system as a Kindle user, so I did not have a problem going from my Iphone to this.  Also I know people complain about the app availability and for me-complete non-issue.  I'm not a big app user.  My only complaint really is the battery life.
A really bad buy, the phone has been behaving wierd for a long time. It has stopped sending out my audio on phone calls. So, someone on the other side has no idea I am on the line. Now I have to switch my phone off and on again every time someone call me and call them again to get to talk.
Average phone missing some important apps I used daily with my Tab3. Lack of Google Play will keep this phone from ever being a serious player in the Smart Phone industry. The only unique feature, Dynamic Perspective, has stopped working since the OS updated last night.<br/><br/>Update. The reason my Dynamic Perspective stopped working was related to the app LastPass. Thanks to Russ the outstanding Mayday tech support rep for figuring it out. I uninstalled the app and everything works fine.
Love this phone! Great camera. Cool functions.
I love Amazon, I hate this phone.  Every time I try to place a call, answer a call or open an app, I have to clear pop ups or decline an "update" for an app I don't even have.  I contacted support to get help to no avail.  This thing is going in the junk drawer.
This phone needs more options inside the app store Google play and iPhone both have a lot more options toward Syncing your phone with your TV or even your game system at half PlayStation apps in Xbox apps call of duty apps Because with all the new games that's coming out on the new updated next-generation systems all those games has apps and you can download those apps to control your game and update information three your app on your phone when you away from your game now where has the Amazon fire phone would not be able to do that because they have no actual game system apps that can control their and update their game from elsewhere and Amazon needs to make there own task killer built in the phone not an app that you download, and this phone glitches and stalls and crashes
I discovered you use the Cloud technology that is fueled by dirty power which is an unnecessary assault on our environment. The phone has all kinds of new and fun ways of connecting with family and friends however until you change how you fuel your power source I have no intention of upgrading. We all must work together to lower the carbon output on this planet we all live on so  we all have a responsibility to make sure we do no harm so please consider going over to a solar or wind powered system as your phone is used by so many people that you have a chance to make a real difference.
I have no idea what critics were thinking, but based on my usage for a day (public transit in nyc) and also my wife's (she has to juggle household chores and our 4 month old son) the one hand operation of this phone simply blows away my galaxy note 2, nexus 5, galaxy s4.<br/><br/>Dynamic perspective is good and while firefly was effective but did not have lot of use cases to test it out yet.<br/><br/>Few cons that I have witnessed is the heat generated by the phone. My wife believes iphone and nexus are also similar to fire phone in this aspect, so atleast it does not seem too bad in this respect but compared to Samsung it is still bad.<br/>Other big one is the obvious lack of google's native apps, but the incredible speed of silk browser, kind of balms it over.<br/><br/>Overall a very nice phone with people needing one hand operation.<br/><br/>########  update after 3 days of usage. #########<br/><br/>I have upgraded rating to 5 star. We managed to get some google apps side loaded and the heating issue has also subsided somewhat.
I love my fire phone more than my I phone 6
This phone is not bad. I say this not actually having placed a call yet. I've been using the thing on WiFi only until the new SIM arrives and I can get cell sevice on it.<br/><br/>I got this phone unlocked and at an incredible deal, so for me part of the phone's appeal is the value of the device. After the full year of prime, which I would have renewed anyway, it was very hard for me to say no.I wanted to see what the fuss ( complaining) was about, so I pulled the trigger.<br/><br/>This isn't a bad first attempt. Just think about how flawed that first iPhone was. People loved to hate it, but the iPhone got better and now the iPhone is almost synonymous with the smartphone device. The iPhone is our bencmark. We compare all phones to it, and I think that's part of the problem. As this is Amazon's first smart phone attempt, we really shouldn't look at it as an iPhone competitor.<br/><br/>Let me just say that I was not an early adopter with this thing. It isn't unique enough to stand apart from its competitors. Since this iteration does not include access to the Google Play store, that has turned some people off. But Amazon's app store isn't anything to sneeze at. It's robust and filled to the brim with all sorts of apps from developers that want your money, some of whom have also put their product I n the Play store as well.<br/><br/>I hope Amazon doesn't abandon this project in light of any negative press about it. I'm eager to see how they can improve the phone.
I love the pictures and it was great as a spare when I went abroad. I am not using the actual phone as this was a very cool prize I won at a conference. I have been using the phone as a camera and to use the wifi features and what it allows me to do.
When I first bought the phone the OS was extremely buggy.  If I were to open a link from an email, it would open a blank page in the browser and I would have to reopen up the email and reclick the link to get it to load.  The camera on the phone is not good at all compared to other phones.  I have also had issues where apps crash and the phone randomly decides to restart itself as well as bugs with the music app that are insanely annoying.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with this phone is that after 1 year and 4 days, it crashed out completely and is no longer functional. I barely use the phone, its never been dropped, and I have 6 apps I have downloaded from the app store, none side loaded.  I am stuck at a bios like screen that says, "file system recover" and I cant get past it.  It gives options to reboot the system, restore it to factory defaults, apply an update manually, or wipe the cache.  I have tried all of these and the phone simply reverts back to the same screen.  When I called Amazon they would not replace the phone because I was 4 days out of warranty and couldn't if they wanted to because the phone is no longer being produced and they are out of stock. I am basically screwed and have to buy a new phone out right.  Glad I have been I prime member for 8 years (Amazon, I really hope you can sense the sarcasm here).  I really hope customer service steps up here and helps out.
It is so difficult for me to understand why Amazon was forced to discontinue the Fire phone. In my opinion, the Fire phone is perhaps the best Android-based smart phone in the market. If you ever hold one in your hand and use it for a day, you know what I mean. I used many Android devices before, including some phone from Motorola and Samsung and nothing ever come as close.<br/><br/>I initially got the unlocked Fire phone  on a lightning special deal for my upcoming trips oversea, but came to really like it after a couple of weeks. Fire phone supports ultra-high resolution camera (13MP) and 1080p video way before any smartphone in the same class. High definition 4.7” screen with gorgeous colors. I currently use it as a Wifi Hotspot and back up phone with an awesome TMobile plan, and save $20/month in the process. Couldn’t be happier. Btw, its Hotspot’s performance is at least same or better than my previous Hotspot-specific device from Samsung. You can still connect 5 devices to it at the same time.<br/><br/>Since Amazon no longer makes this phone or releases software upgrades, I don’t expect to use it for long. If I can get a couple of years out of it I would be happy.  But for now, it is one of the best toys I have!<br/><br/>Come on, Amazon!! Make the next Fire phone!! Or at least make a Fire OS version for existing Fire phones while you making one for Fire tablets!
Camera on the phone keeps breaking and the head phone jack is unrealiable. I do not recommend to buy this phone if the price is over $100. I paid for a device that worked good up untill a month later and then it crapped the bed.
I had the Amazon Fire phone for less than a day before I returned it, and settled on an HTC One. I had been drawn in to the Fire because of Firefly, the Prime membership extension, and the ability to get my free monthly ebook and watch free tv/movies. The dedicated camera launch button was a plus.<br/><br/>Dynamic Perspective was a let down. The gestures to fliip it from side to side to view menus got to be complicated, and they had to be done "just so". I wasn't super impressed with the camera anymore so than my old Samsung Galaxy. The speakers being on the ends didn't do anything for me, either. I'm much happier with the speaker placement on the HTC One.<br/><br/>The Big Brother-esque intrusion on Twitter and Facebook made me not hook it up through the embedded options; it would let Amazon read & use your content. So because I chose to use the standalone apps, I couldn't get decent notifications.<br/><br/>The lack of Google was the big con for me. I didn't realize how much I relied on Google services. The mapping app included is utter s***. It didn't locate stores that I know have been down the street for many years. And the mapping service thought I was a whole town over. Sure you can plug in your gmail to the native email app, but it wasn't as userfriendly to me as the Gmail app.<br/><br/>The carousel ended up being more annoying than useful. The inability to remove/move native apps from the front home screen was super annoying.<br/><br/>I tried to justify keeping it. I'd been so stupidly sure that I'd love it, that I sold my Kindle. So if I got rid of the Fire phone, I would have no ability to watch free tv/movies on the go, and would lose my monthly free book. But I really scrutinized the tv/movies, and found nothing I'd want to watch.<br/><br/>I'm much happier with the HTC One. I'd moved from a Samsung Galaxy S3 to the Fire Phone to the HTC One. Having the HTC One in my hands felt like "home", it was much easier to use, more intuitive.
I have been using this phone for 4 days and as a long time Android cell user<br/>- I am enjoying it. I have had no problems with the phone. If you are<br/>considering this phone - do your research first . I bought this when it<br/>became discounted. I very much like and use Amazon Prime and this comes with<br/>1 year of Prime. If you an experienced user of Apple or Android phones and<br/>not use to changes - you will probably have problems adapting to the Amazon<br/>OS or ecosystem.<br/>If you are familiar with the Kindle Fire tablets you will probably enjoy the<br/>Fire phone. If you are use to Kindle tablets , you should already know that<br/>there is no Google Play store on the phone just the Amazon App store.<br/>Perspective view with multiple front cameras is a nice feature. Time will<br/>tell if one will get bored with it. Battery life appears to be normal for<br/>this type of phone. It will need to be charged at least once every day.<br/>Complaints:<br/>1) Apparently no actual "back" button. Swiping up can only go so far.<br/>2) Some aps that run on the Kindle HDX tablets are not available for the<br/>Phone even though the hardware is the same.<br/>Wishes:<br/>1) a true "Back" key<br/>2) longer battery life<br/>3) slightly bigger screen
I live in the UK and bought it off eBay for £70, upgrading from an iPhone 4S. For that price, it's a really good phone and a pretty good deal. The build quality looks decent, but still, I put a case on it straight away, which should help to protect it. Screen size is good. Bigger than the 4S, but not as big as some of the latest phones out there.<br/><br/>I must admit, I thought I was taking a bit of a gamble, what with the perceived lack of software out there. I did manage to find most of what I was looking for on the Amazon Store. For the apps I couldn't find, I decided to install the Google Play store from APKs. That was so easy. Worked first time (and via the latest Fire OS), opening up a whole world of apps. Not everything is compatible right now, but there's plenty that is. I think the only thing I haven't got working as I'd like, is Google Plus.<br/><br/>Yes, the dynamic perspective is a bit of a waste of time. It does look cool though. Maybe I am easily pleased. And the extra "cameras" supporting it are a little bit ugly, but not so much that it put me off.<br/><br/>A good all-round basic phone. Shame it got cancelled. They should have put what they learned from the experience into a bigger, better version 2.
Sensitive, requires your attention when typing. Requires a learning period.<br/>Transitioning into the fire.<br/><br/> So far I see good things in the phone software, all seem to improve on other phones,<br/>Still early in my use of the fire phone.<br/><br/>The phone has (apps) locked up a few times, requiring restart, the battery is depleted way more than it should be based on the use, I assume the blame maybe the brightness of the screen. It drains the battery every time you have the screen on.<br/>Accessory, Screen protector and leather case, well worth buying them, improves screen feel and phone comfort.<br/><br/>Flaws I have found, is the apps are not that great for free stuff. The battery life is way too short for the use it receives, Update, 8.5 days on a charge, so not too bad.<br/>This phone warms up noticeably during playing music or videos, any kind of streaming.<br/> Using a case helps insulate your hands while holding it, from the hot phone.<br/><br/>Benefits of Fire over any other phones:<br/>1 Amazon cloud, music movies, books.<br/>2 Mayday, service help.<br/>3 OS upgrade, phone with out buying new phone every year.<br/>4 Year of Prime<br/>5 FireFly feature.<br/>6 Ease of searching apps and installing.<br/>7 Music player<br/>8 Instant video player<br/><br/>Update, the phone has a "fire" Whisper Link Activity View, and it locks up constantly, I call Amazon, and they don't know what I am talking about. It sure is annoying, wish there was a way update it.
I really wanted to love this phone because I love Amazon, but I don't. Here are the pros and cons in my opinion:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>Battery lasts a long time.<br/><br/>Easy access to shopping on Amazon with Firefly.<br/><br/>Plenty of storage.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>Only browser available is the Silk browser and it sucks! Half the time the browser doesn't work and no amount of force closing the application will get it to work right, you just can't access any websites until it decides to work.<br/><br/>Auto text is drunk! Seriously some of the words it tries to fill in with I swear are not even English or are not even close to what I tried to put in. When I Swype a simple word it puts shoebox in. POINT PROVEN! Shoebox= something.<br/><br/>The camera sucks. I've had two Fire phones now because the first one was defective and got dust under the cover and over the camera lens. The replacement just takes AWFUL pictures.<br/><br/>The app store sucks! More often than not I can't get an app that I'm looking for because it's through Google Play. GET OVER IT AMAZON! Let Google on your phone and it would be 100x better!<br/><br/>Those are just a few. The big ones.
To all those who don't like this phone, your idiots. It's not an iPhone and that's exactly why I bought it and love it. It's basically my kindle only smaller and I can put it in my pocket, and I make phone calls. I love how easy it is to use, I have access to all the apps from Amazon and if I wanted others I could get them. But the only apps I trust are the ones approved by Amazon. I had an iPhone and gave it away because of all the problems it gave me and the resolution it didn't have. Thank you Amazon for this incredible phone.<br/>I decided to add to my review. It's now May 10th and I've had time to learn a bit more about the phone and time to appreciate it even more and love the ease of use. I know some people complain about the flick of the wrist and no back button or swipe function but I've never had a problem with any of those functions and the firefly function is awesome, it outshines any of the apps I had on Apple, plus it doesn't have to be right in front of a speaker or have the volume at deafening sounds. I can't improve on the stars but I would if possible. Still love my fire phone.
Being an Amazon customer for many years and a prime member I wanted to love this phone. I tried the phone for two weeks and then wound up returning it to AT&T; with a $35 restocking fee #%¥€. The phone has some fun features but not enough to make me keep the phone. The apps that I couldn't get with this phone weren't devastating but I still miss the some of the Apps I had with the iPhone. There are a few major disappointments with the phone. First of all it gets very warm and uses up the battery extremely fast. Probably the biggest reason I bought the phone was the Mayday help button. I felt like when I called they could answer easy questions; if you looked it up in the user guide you get the same answer. When I called to ask why my music through the Bluetooth in my car was skipping. They had me do a number of different things to the phone which I lost some information. I called three or four times to get an answer on this and no one seemed to know the answer so I plugged in my iPhone 3G into the car and played the songs that skipped on the amazon fire phone and it didn't skip. Then I plugged my iPhone 5c and the songs didn't skip. One representative told me they had a new update for the phone which I couldn't get from my phone so they instructed me  to download it from the computer onto my phone so I did all that and when I called back because it didn't work the other rep said oh no you can't download it from the computer you have to download it from your phone which wasn't available at  the time. Now I will need to transfer the songs I bought on Amazon to iTunes; another hassle. I hope they improve this phone in the future. I think it was released too early. But I do love Amazon' a customer service; it cannot be beat. I just placed an order and will continue to do so.
Bad very bad. Play Store? :/
Pros:<br/><br/>Sturdy/built well<br/>fun extras: dynamic perception, firefly, ect...<br/>great sound (using phone/music)<br/>easy amazon purchases<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>missing common apps<br/>crashes randomly<br/>won't show missed calls/texts/ect...<br/><br/>I bought this phone back in August, originally because I love amazon. I think the site is amazing, I've loved my moms kindle fire, and I liked the fun add-ons that it has. The phone itself is well built, study, and is appealing looks wise. I have had a case and a screen protector on it since I bought it, but even without the case I'm pretty sure that it would hold up.<br/><br/>All these great things do not make up for what it is, and that is a flop.<br/>Probably 90% of the time the phone will not display that I'm getting a call, and even if it does it won't tell me I have a missed call.<br/>The apps crash constantly, I have tried everything, resetting the phone deleting apps, you name it and it does not get better.<br/>The app store is O.K., its missing a lot of common apps, but I knew about that going in, but it is still quite frustrating.<br/>My lock screen randomly changes on me even though I tell it not to.<br/>I have to restart my phone probably once a day, sometimes more, to get it to run at a proper speed.<br/>I've heard it doesn't have the best battery life, I was used to an iphone that I dropped in a puddle, so I don't notice the lack of battery life.<br/><br/>All in all, loved the concept but I would never recommend this phone to anyone. There are too many bugs, and it is just all around too frustrating to have.
This phone program will not increase the font size.  If you are over 40 this can present a problem with reading text messages and using the phone book. Returned phone.
It's a different operating system than I am used to and there are a few apps that I cannot download but over all its a pretty great phone I like it and recommend it.
I wrote a long review about my troubles with the Amazon Fire phone and AT&T.; However, it's now gone? The only explanation I can think is that Amazon deleted it.<br/><br/>I don't have the time or energy to re-write my review, but needless to say, it has been a nightmare. The phone was terrible and AT&T; keeps charging me, even though the account is canceled. Amazon promises to take care of it, but as of yet they haven't.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I've made over a dozen call to Amazon and AT&T;, but they still haven't reversed my charges--in fact every time I call I get the runaround or excuses.<br/>Funny thing is: today a collections notice showed up from AT&T.;<br/><br/>BUYER BEWARE!
I got this phone on contract via O2, at first I was amazed, one of the best phones I have ever had, I was even recommending family and friends to get this phone! However, after about 6 months everything started to go wrong. It was getting over heated both when it was getting used or not. Regularly when I attempt to unlock the screen it stays black, it wont switch on, wont turn off, no matter what I do, then the speech comes on asking 'how can I help you?' but still, a black screen. This phone doesn't like the 'Facebook' app, it will just shut the system down, nor does it let you send messages on the app, instead I have to use my laptop. I am very carful with my phone, I always have a case on an take extra care when using it but the screen does not work as effectively as it should do, the touch screen is not that great! its as if it was made several years ago when technology was just getting good. the battery life was promised to stay 'great', I only allow my phone to be on charge for and hour, then unplug to stop the battery getting worse, but it now only last a max of 6 hours, even when not touched...<br/>Being 18 I use my phone very often, can the Fire Phone not come with being used everyday? I would highly suggest you think before you get this phone, is the small amount of 3D really worth the price?<br/>I am very disappointed in my experience of the Amazon Fire Phone, Amazon was my number 1 place to get everything!! I will be going back to iPhone's or Samsungs as soon as I can! I am not impressed.
I really like the phone. Everything is easy to get to and use.The best phone I have owned and with a year of Prime to go with it what else can you ask for.
This phone has blown my expectations. I highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants a high quality phone without the expensive price of an iPhone. This phone has many features that make it a force to be reckoned with. For example, unlike siri from Apple, the Fire Phone's voice control can answer questions from "where is the nearest Target" to "What is the square root of 1,986". The phone also comes with the new "Firefly" which enables you to scan price tags and find the product you scaned on Amazon.com for an even better price. This phone is a very good phone, however, I would recommend you buy a screen protector and a case right away. This phone was built gor luxury and durability, but the screen can get scratched easily. I dropped mine and it didn't break, but it did get a little scratch on yhe screen. Over all, this is an amazing phone and I am looking foreward to using it everyday.
This phone is a piece of crap. The only thing remotely good about the fire phone is a year of prime for free. You cant send pictures over 1 MB in a text and the phone is constantly freezing up, glitching, and turning off. I took it to AT&T; to replace it, which I did, and the same crap happened. Also even if you bought s song make sure your music library is switched from cloud to device or else you can say good bye to your data plan unless you're connected to WiFi 24/7. No Google apps. 3rd party apps screw with the phone. Battery life sucks. Etc. Etc. etc... save your money. Definitely not worth it. In 5 years? maybe. Now? HECK no!
Pros:<br/>Good camera<br/>Good UI considering it's brand new<br/>Comfortable design<br/>Camera hardware key<br/>Great price ($130)<br/>Includes a free year of amazon prime<br/>High end processor<br/>Pretty good screen res for the size (315 ppi)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>No google play store (but you can add it with some work)<br/>Gets VERY hot<br/>Poor battery life<br/><br/>All in all, for the price ($130) its a steal. Sure there's no google play store out of the box but you can put it on there with some work. The battery life is poor but most people are around a charger most of the time anyways.<br/>The UI (User Interface) is pretty good for it being brand new, much better then the first version of Sense or Touchwiz considering it isn't buggy as all hell.<br/>So if you want to try a new UI, don't mind a little work, can deal with poor battery life and have $130 laying around and use amazon to buy a lot of things, then this phone is perfect for you.
Best phone I've had. Mayday feature is amazing, and the modified Android is feels refreshing. Can't wait for a larger screened model to come out.
Short simple review without turning into a manifesto. I have had androids and iPhones ... lots of both. iPhone can be a pain sometimes but it tends to be a very well developed phone. Rarely does something come out of the Apple oven half baked. The fire phone is so much better for me in many ways. Sizes, screen layout, logical display. The notification scrolling screen is great. HOWEVER!!!! Some Apps and highly flawed on the fire phone. I book bands for shows from time to time, and this has become a Facebook reliant business. On fire phone this the worst app ever. Fire phone "pings" that there is a notification, but no icon shows?!?!? If you scroll over email it shows you a list of email in. Great idea. If you scroll over Facebook... it shows you what to buy???? It locks up a lot on Facebook!!! this means you are restarting the phone to get out of it. If you like having a circle of friends on a phone list...... you don't get that here. You can't separate your most common numbers from your list. I have over 200 phone numbers and I can't separate my home, wife or family from the list.. Major bummer! With that said, just about everything else is great! I hope AMAZON is reading. I will keep on this phone for years but you need to fix the obvious flaws. They are big freaking flaws!!
Do yourself a favor and wait until Amazon runs one of it's 'One day only sales'. I got the phone with no Sim card and 32GB with a free year of prime for $189.00. The prime membership was half the cost and with a Net 10 Sim card kit, I get unlimited access for 30 days at $45.00. For the money it beats the hell out of my kids over priced i-phone or the Galaxy5 with monthly AT&T; plans at $135/mo. I travel every day and with the heart radio app I listen to my favorites as I drive, calls come straight through if you want them to and I've dropped the thing on a concrete floor twice with no damage. We have 2 fire sticks and basically only need WiFi now as we cancelled Comcast as we do not require cable TV anymore. You can take the stick on vacation, plug it into any new TV and Prime comes right along with you.
This phone has a lot of cool features but in my experience the battery life stinks, navigation is difficult and the apps have an unfinished feel. This may be a great phone someday but someday is not here yet.
Five stars because I only have one gripe with this phone, the screen doesn't come back on after it goes off when making a phone call.
So far, still trying to learn this. But, it is nice.
Amazon OS works great but needs the apps that are newer. I would like to be able to play some games found on Android devices.
For this to be a first for Amazon, it is definitely impressive. However they still have a long ways to go before the Fire Phone will be comparable to other devices. Mainly with the lack of apps that are provided in the app store, no backscreen option, and a few minimal details. But what it does have going for it makes up for where it lacks. The dynamic perspective very cool but there are a limited number of apps that use is. The feature I have come to enjoy the most without a doubt though is Firefly. It can pick up songs almost instantly, as well as movies and television shows. It also allows you to transfer helpful information you might see on a business, newspaper ad, and elsewhere. Can't wait to see where they go from here with updates.
I wanted to love this phone. I can't. I can't use the apps I love-- Target Cartwheel, Locately, Youtube, etc... and now I can't play the audio books I check out from the library. It makes me sad that a company I typically love has been such a disappointment when it comes to this device.
The design of the phone is beautiful and sleek, and the overall capacity of the phone is great. It doesn't tend to slow down at all and I have noticed it is very good when coming to handle more than one app at once. The only concerns that I have is that it tends to over heat easily, almost to the point of discomfort to the user. The other concern, is that the cameras shoot very well, but the four corner front cameras aren't usable and somewhat of a nuisance when it comes to reading something and all of the sudden the camera thinks you want to scroll and you lose your place. The phone overall runs extremely well and fast, but some things that people might want to look at before purchasing.
I have a Fire Phone that I have had for 4 months. The phone glitches, freezes, and will just turn itself off regularly. The phone will just automatically open the gallery, Amazon's music app, or the Firefly feature at random. The browser is horrible, and the apps are limited.<br/>Amazon doesn't even want these phones back with their Trade in program.  I wanted to like this phone, but instead I was disappointed. I love my Kindle Paper White, and my Kindle Fire. I've never had a problem shopping on Amazon. The only thing I cannot complain about with this phone is the camera, but that is not enough of a savings Grace. I will not be recommending this phone to anyone, and buying a new phone.
It's not bad, I like it! It could be better! I think it shouldbe more privacy on the Carousel or at least give you the option, I wish I could have emoji's, I know it's not an iPhone but some phone could still get them! I'm a big picture taking person so I love the picture quality on the front and back cameras! I love the fact that at anytime of the day I could call my mayday people lol I use them a lot! I love my prime, let's me watch movies etc, borrow books 2 day shipping! I also think I should be able to have the option to get my notifications other than email phone calls and messages on my lock screen! But other than that love it, but this phone it's for everyone!
It started pretty awesome. I was given the opportunity to upgrade my phone and my AT&T; store offered me to try the Amazon Fire phone. The phone at first was pretty neat, 3D visuals and new settings, It was a little difficult to find out at first how it worked and it was a bit annoying as there are no return buttons or settings button like the android which I had grown accustomed to. The camera is impressive and I was very happy, but I did not have a way to custom my wallpaper which made me sad :( I liked the way some of the apps were set but the carousel was too much for me as it was in big icons and held information you might not want everyone to view in public. the first thing on my mind was I have to buy a case for this phone as it looks like if you drop it once it could break. Calling settings are pretty good. Although if I use my phone for too long it gets super warm and I have to let it cool down. :( Some apps are hard to find... in the end.... I found out the Fire phone was okay, but just not for me :/
The app store just doesn't carry basic apps, including but not limited to airline and bank apps I had on my previous android phone.  I travel a lot, and those are pretty important apps to me. I have had the phone for two weeks, and I've had to reboot it three times because it got stuck.  On the other hand, phone clarity is excellent and the basic email handling system is quite good.  The texting program works well, and allows for group texting better than some other androids.  The keyboard isn't always responsive, however, and I have to retype words three or four times because it just doesn't process.  If I were to do it over, I'd go with the Samsung Galaxy S5.
I switched from the iPhone and upgraded to the Amazon Fire. At first I was skeptical, but since I basically used my iPhone for books and audio books, I thought I'd give it a try. I not only liked it, but I LOVED it. After an accident in a canoe tohat caused me to replace it, I didn't hesitate to get the Fire again. Minor complaints with some freezing, but it hasn't happened once I got everything set up. One of the other minuses is that Amazon doesn't have access to the Google+ apps, but still a large source of apps are available. It all depends on what you use your phone for, but if your a bookstore, this is the phone for you.
Why has amazon stopped selling this?  When I asked I was told they don't know.  I asked why there hasn't been a recent update and again they don't know. I think this is a defective product amazon is hoping will last through the warranty.  I've had my phone for 4 months and it's working fine, but  I do not buy disposable electronics.  I have bought enough of Amazon's junk products they flood the market with just to get us to consume more. I am finished with Amazon. I was told the review process is more about emotion then fact. Seems funny  I was told that, but they won't sell me another phone or offer an explanation why.
Awesome phone! I really recommend all amazon's products.
I, too, wanted to love my Amazon Fire phone, but the App store is tragically disappointing, and its basic capacity to be a PHONE is at times lackluster. I will answer a call only to discover that the other caller can't hear me, or I can't hear them (less often). I miss the camera of even my old Galaxy S3.<br/><br/>The video and music playback are convenient and enjoyable, but almost used an entire months data by auto downloading media before I navigated my way deep enough into the program to change its settings. I sent weeks with my data turned off to conserve the data and avoid fees.<br/><br/>Physically, the phone feels solid, and I actually trust it not to break or crack so far. I frequently drop it or toss it across the room onto light surfaces, or bash into things with it in my pockets.<br/><br/>Really, though, I could forgive this phone all it's flaws if they would just up their app store game!! Come on, Amazon!
I was afraid after reading the reviews about the phone because I failed to read them before ordering. To the people with complaints or future buyers, watch the tutorial when you power on your phone. It makes using your Amazon so much easier and those that don't fully understand hit MAYDAY and there's a live rep that you can see at their desk to assist you, that had to be the coolest... however I found that the phone does get  hot but that's when my battery is at its lowest level.. but I found a very nice case on Amazon for $12 regularly priced at $32...oh yeah it comes with 1yr free PRIME..Overall I love this phone
Wish u had an app that had a direct phone and text contact. Also wish it was bigger. Love the mayday!
This phone has been nothing but trouble. does not work with a lot of google app's. it randomly rebooted and deleted recently added contacts, the speaker volume occasionally will work, but I cannot turn up the volume unless I turn it down first, then the digital display allows me to turn it up. the glass cracked even with it in a thick phone case. I really feel I wasted my time getting stuck into a 2 year contract, thinking this phone was going to be amazing... oh and you cannot share anything through blu tooth. it only allows anyone to send me files where I cannot send them any files... don't waste your time.
I have to say that I wanted this to be a five star review, but there are some critical flaws here that really need to be addressed.<br/><br/>1.). If you're going to build this on android, let it run android apps.  Sure, I could side load apps, but who really wants to spend their time doing that?  No Runkeeper, No Zombies, Run! Those were the first two apps I looked for.  Then, no Google apps either.  I bought this because I do love me some Amazon, but a phone without access to best of class apps is crippled.<br/>2.). This phone would not pair properly with my truck.  The Entune audio in my Toyota refused to see this device as a hands free device or allow me to stream music from it.  That's just confusing, because Bluetooth is a very open standard, not sure how engineers could drop the ball on this.<br/><br/>The hardware is great, the dynamic perspective pretty neat.  There were some goofy things about the interface, but I was still tinkering when I returned this to Amazon for reasons 1 and 2.  Those two flaws were deal breakers for me.
I actually got the 64gb version on this phone & I love it!! I went ahead & installed CM 11 on this phone to get the android feel & so far everything is working fine!! The battery life is really good on this phone& the camera which were the two main factors in getting this phone besides of course the cost, which I got the phone for $159.99, which included a Year of Prime free or will extend to a year longer!! Can't complain so far!! So sad that Amazon had to get rid of these phones all together!! If, they would've only went with Android, I think it would've been a better outcome!!!
This phone is amazing. I can read my books on it, check my email, get online, take, save and send pictures and, oh yes, call people.<br/>I'm from the dial up generation and this was simple enough to learn, but the May Day Button  helped me out in a few confusing spots. The May Day button was the main reason I chose this phone. I'm a bit intimidated by newer technology.<br/>I have a classroom full of 20 somethings and they were equally impressed with it's features when I brought it to school. (My version of show and tell)  Give this phone a try and you will not be disappointed.
It's a great phone. I'm happy with pretty much everything about it. My one complaining is with the apps.<br/>  The updates are slow and not as current as other platforms. The selection is a bit more limited than Android and the Google play store, but it has everything I need. I made sure of this before getting the phone, so I wouldn't be left stranded without my banking app.<br/>  The screen, cameras, and audio are amazing. They do suck down the battery a little faster than most people would like, but it can be managed. I only have to charge the phone once a day.
I got the FW of phone upgraded about 2 weeks ago. And phone start running really really slow, sometimes the touch panel doesn't even work. Also the power consumption raised dramatically, fully charged battery can only stand by for about 7~8 hours.<br/>This morning I found all my files(mp3 and photos) on the phone are just gone, no clue for what's going wrong. Try to use Mayday function and can't even connect to this service stably. Very disappointed(I just have this phone for 5 months!!!), will definitely get a new phone to stop this kind of tortures.
I'm a true Amazon fan. I really wanted this phone to succeed. I bought it as soon as it was released. I'm currently on my replacement phone, hoping that my experience was just a fluke. But it was not. This phone is possibly the worst smart phone I've ever owned. It possesses a lot of cool features, how ever it's far behind everything currently on the market, which is sad because I've only had it for 4 months. The best feature about this phone is Amazon's amazing customer service as always. I used Amazon's "Mayday" service to complain about the phone not charging. I would plug it in, and it would repeatedly go from charging status, to not charging. So they replaced the phone immediately. The ability to connect with a customer service rep within 10 seconds via video is pretty amazing, and if I was rating their customer service, I would be giving them 5-stars right now. Every morning, the phone does not automatically connect to the 4G LTE once I leave my house. I have to restart it every single time. Additionally, about 3-4 times a day, the phone simply does not respond to any button I press to bring the screen up to unlock the phone. I'm thinking it's doing something, but once I'm finally able to get the screen to turn on, I drag my finger down from the top to see what it is doing, and there is nothing. The camera is extremely limited in the settings menu. I can't do something as simple as setting a timer for the camera. The camera takes entirely too long to focus. the frame rate on the camera is the slowest I've seen on any smart phone camera. I can't believe Amazon said they spent 4 years making this phone. This phone seems like it was rushed through production. Another annoyance is that I have to manually organize my apps in alphabetical order. There isn't an option I can select for the phone to do it on it's own. The only place it organizes the apps automatically is when you switch over to the Cloud. Everyone complains that you're restricted to the apps available on the Amazon app store. This isn't really an issue for me. When I first started using an Android phone, I was in the same situation. People quickly forget the past. The app store is growing quickly. Everything I used on my old Android phone is now available in the Amazon App store. If you're looking to purchase this phone, I would steer clear, and stick with an Android phone. Amazon needed this phone to sell. Unfortunately, this phone was a massive dud in my opinion, and it shows in the sales figures.
First I want to say I'm not a phone poweruser and previously had an iPhone.  I like the Fire and the year of Prime is a bonus.  Sound quality is excellent.  I don't miss google apps and if I ever do I can just turn on the "allow non-Amazon app installation."  Everything loads so fast, not something I was used to with the old iPhone I had been using.  I do miss having a speaker phone. The dynamic pictures are very eye catching and kind of gimmicky but I like them.  Overall i'm enjoying my new phone and would recommend it to others.
I bought my Amazon in February 2015... absolutely loved it! 2 months later, or whenever it's JUST right passed when you can return it, I went back to ATT with complaints. As in, my phone randomly calls people who are NOT in my contact list, my phone will not receive calls at all, no text messages are being received on either end. Well ATT tells me, they don't handle the phones, Amazon does,  BUT if I want a new one just pay off the $400 on this phone and get a new one.  UMMMMMMM NOPE..... I don't want this broken phone let alone pay you for a broken phone... duh....<br/><br/>so I call Amazon, who sends me a new fire promptly... again first month, perfect.... now back to the same ole headache... why oh why must technology want to annoy me... now the waiting game again... dumb...
There are not as many apps available like in Google play store. I do not like that there is no actually back button and only able to up swipe. The sound quality needs improvements. When I turn the volume up it just sounds like noise and not the song I am listening to. This is unfortunate because I like to listen to music on my phone a lot. The speakers in my old S4 had better sound quality even with the one speaker. I think the fire sounds more like an AM radio. I like that instant video is available as an app for this phone.
Guessing all Fire phone buyers are super excited right now... My friend has been playing with his for hours, I haven't seen him so excited over something since the release of Playstation 4. He ordered it as soon as he checked the list of specifications a few months ago. Being highly demanding, always in search for innovative, practical, and tastefully designed programs and applications, this brand new phone has him getting all enthusiastic, claiming that it is the most freakingly fantastic gadget ever. The ever so anticipated Dynamic Perspective software is "mind-blowingly genius", he says. Obviously this particular application is one of the main reasons potential customers will purchase this, along with the Firefly application. Only drawback, seems to be battery life which is drained quite fast, though considerably longer than an i-Phone's, which I guess is pretty impressive. Apparently, Amazon has managed to present a most accomplished smartphone device for gadget lovers, and casual users, despite its rather costly price. Well done then.<br/><br/>PS: Check out other reviews for more technical analysis, this is just my friend's opinion, hopefully helpful to those interested in a short review of the product.
The interface is strange at first but I really like the carousel and the way each app gets its own suggestions as you scroll, messages and email show recent entries, and calendar shows upcoming events. It's hard to explain but it flows nicely. The whole thing flows once you figure out which way it's going.<br/><br/>The app selection is okay but there are apps I couldn't get. Fortunately, the ones I really need were there, mobile sites will do for others, and I can live without the ones I've lost access to.<br/><br/>The display is very nice, the phone feels great in hand, and there is no lag or stuttering. Phone quality is good and it paired easily with Bluetooth devices.<br/><br/>The lack of a back button is taking some adjustment. You have to swipe up from the bottom of the screen. Its growing on me.<br/><br/>I use Airwatch MDM to connect to Exchange - no issues for mail, contacts, and calendar.<br/><br/>Dynamic perspective doesn't matter to me. It doesn't get in the way, adds some effects. It's done well but I just don't need it. I'm much more excited about Firefly recognizing phone numbers and offering to dial them.<br/><br/>It's too soon to say about battery life. Seems on par with the HTC One M7 I came from so it's decent.<br/><br/>I'm enjoying the phone a lot. It's odd, but I knew it would be. Some things I'm used to are not there, but I knew they wouldn't be.<br/><br/>I think Amazon did a good job here. Solid phone that integrates apps and services well. Not as seamlessly as iOS but more seamlessly than Google's Android phones from the various vendors.<br/><br/>Very happy so far.
feels great, looks great, works great. had it for 2 weeks, easy friendly features, love the wrist flick to get access to basic settings (wifi, bluetooth, etc). very nice screen, just the right size for scrolling and choosing apps in any place on the sxreen. it reacts fast, has good call quality (crisp sound). the bluetooth works great in my car and I have never heard such clear music from my previous devices. research the apps before you buy if you are looking for specific ones, or sideload them if you know how ! firefox, chrome, salesforce, outlook all work great (all sideload). my wife loves it too and uses waze for driving places and loves the sound of her bluetooth audio too. only negative is the earphones......yikes ! all in all a solid build !
The Amazon Fire Phone is a wonderful item to buy. The cool features like dynamic perspective and firefly make the phone even better. The ear buds are excellent almost if not as good as beats ear buds. It is also light weight has a sleek black color. However there are bad things about it. One the phone gets to hot if too many apps are open are using it while charging.  Secondly the app store is small compared to Google play and ios. So you have to side load some apps but still an amazing phone with good quality.
This is not good for business people.  I am an artist.  I use PayPal and Square.  This phone won't accept anything but Amazon apps.  The ATT store didn't mention that little detail.  I didn't find out until a week after the two week cut off.  The Amazon pay app has bad reviews in terms of getting your money into your bank account and requests your social security number. I have always disliked ATT because of the difficulty of understanding their bill which changes every month.  I have always felt scammed by ATT.  Now I feel scammed by Amazon.  I used to love Amazon and ordered items every week.  Now I use it for books only.  Amazon lost a good customer by not taking PayPal and Square.  ATT is losing a long-term customer, too.  I can't possible pay any more with another company.  I am drawing the line, I am the customer and Amazon is not providing the service I need.  Anyone want to buy a barely touched Amazon Fire Phone?
I have had my Amazon Fire phone for a month now.  I was a little apprehensive about getting it after reading the reviews.  I am very pleased with the product.  It does everything that I want it to and while the apps are limited, I have access to several that apply to me.  It is nice to travel and/or to to appointments with one device and have access to my books and everything else that I might need. The only problem I have had to date is trying to figure out how to get the back lens of the camera to work.
I bought mine from the AT&T; store in town, after turning down the Apple 5 and Windows phones. I have no interest in Androids. I had seen the commercials on TV and was intrigued. I rarely buy based on a commercial/advertisement without doing research first. The big advantage I saw was I have a Kindle with books loaded, and they synched right up to my phone, which really made my day (I don't like complicated stuff). I don't understand the one complaint about over complicated navigation because I don't see that at all. I have yet to open a book about the phone or call Mayday because I am stuck. "Mediocre battery life" was another problem someone sited. I charge my phone once a day and have sent texts, used apps, read my books without issue. I love the wallpaper that changes daily (I get to go around a couple of offices and share) and the clarity, which is up there with the Kindle. Although I have lost some of my apps, I found a couple Android replacements (FREE) that were better than the ones I have on my iPhone. I have been and will continue to recommend this phone.
Love my phone. It's quick. It does everything: I want and more. It's sleek. And stylish. Plus the accessories are good quality. Love the ear buds. They hug your ear and I can wear them for hours. The apps are good and aren't as expensive and other phones. Watching videos online is great quality. It's just a great phone. Ordering items from Amazon app is easy and it's rather quick I thought. And to top it off they gave me a year of Amazon Prime. Win win. So upgrade and get this phone. You will love it!!
This phone is a really great phone with great features and a really nice screen!!
The phone takes some getting used to,  as an Android user.  It took a little fiddling around with it and some hit-or-misses, but I eventually got down the basics.  It is smooth, thin and not  heavy.  Was a little disappointed in a few of the apps, but I figured I could do without those.  It was quick to set up and link all my accounts (email, facebook, etc.).  I like it and hope to enjoy it for years to come.  However, the reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the headphones.  Apparently, whoever designed the headphones had ear canals as big as Texas.  They do not fit comfortably in the ear, and are always slipping out.  Other than that, the phone is fine.  Well have to do something about the headphones, though.
The negative reviews remind me that the generation we live in us a spoiled rotten one that throws a fit when they have to wait in line for their ten dollar Starbucks coffee. When I got this phone and turned it on to play with it, my jaw dropped. I have an iPad already so I went with the highly anticipated amazon kindle fire for my phone. It gets great reception where I live-which is hard to do since I'm in the country. I have had a blast with this device and sometimes I have to pinch myself that I own something so nice. It's perfect for me since I'm also addicted to books and to Amazon. The absolute only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because after having it for two weeks, I am already encountering annoying glitches when the phone is in sleep mode and I have to push the home screen button several times before it stops teasing me and turns on all the way. I don't have much downloaded on it, so this shouldn't be happening already. Oh well, it's still the best phone I've ever had. Great job amazon!
This phone has changed my whole perspective on what a smartphone should be.  It's a revolutionary idea, with the four infa-red cameras using your body heat and then translating that into movement on the phone, to peek around things, and to just have fun with a new device.  The Fire phone takes great pictures, and has lots of storage for all of your apps, photos, vidoes and in addition, has the Amazon cloud backup over wifi which enables you to have even more of an integrated experience.  It's got a whole new take on the OS, which masters the Android, while making it unique in UI and touch and feel.<br/>If you want a whole new experience on a smartphone, the Amazon Fire Phone is your best bet.
I read lots of reviews and many of them were negative. But there were enough good reviews that I decided to go for it. Admittedly, the one year of Amazon Prime really closed the sale. Verdict? I really like the Fire Phone. It was easy to learn, very responsive, and the Mayday worked brilliantly. Fortunately I only had to use it once while getting started. Like with my iPhone, there are things about it I wish were different, but few enough that I found the Fire Phone fun to own.
I LOVE the phone and the Amazon support!  I have upgraded to the family plan!
I wanted to love this phone...I really did. However, after having to have it replaced after 6 months and now 6 months later it's acting up again, I'm ready for my contract to be up so I can get rid of it. After returning it and getting a replacement, Amazon canceled my prime membership since I returned the phone. It's a piece of Crap and I am so mad at myself for spending the money on it and being stuck with it for two years. I hate it. 0/5 stars! Do not buy!
Great phone. Picked one up on eBay barely used with a case for $155. App selection is a little limited but growing. I haven't missed any apps yet, if you know where to look almost any app is available. I find fire os as an upgrade from stock android. I can't see using a screen this size with one hand without fire os gestures. There is a back button, just flick up from the bottom of the screen. Easier than trying to press a virtual button imo.  Everything is clean, snappy, and well thought out. I think the majority of bad reviews come from people who are a little closed minded. Give it a chance, and there are deals to be had if you shop around.
If you can still find one on eBay with Prime included, this phone is an incredible bargain. I paid around $100, so, with Prime included, the phone was essentially free. Now, Fire OS isn't for everyone, including me, but with a quick root and Cyanogenmod 11 installed (instructions are all over the web - it's not difficult), you have an unlocked upper mid-range phone running Kitkat, and doing it very well. What's not to like? Five stars all day long!
Love this phone. found no problems that other reviewers complained about
I decided to return mines.<br/><br/>It was fast and easy to use but the app store was terrible(ex. no Clash of Clans or banking apps). On top of that games made the phone run to hot. Battery life was less than advertised. They should have asked LG or Motorola to make a phone for them to skin vs making this half baked product(ex. Nexus 6 is a Google phone made by Motorola, the Nexus 5 is a Google phone made by Lg). Imagine an Amazon phone made by Sony...<br/><br/>Now I see they dropped the price but not low enough. The phone shouldn't cost more than a Moto X 2013 or Nexus 5, two phone that out class this phone in most categories.
I really like this phone.  I've used an android for several years and was used to that, and I never learned to love the iphone at all.  So, I bought the fire phone when it came out.  Sure there is a bit of a learning curve, as with any new product, but it's becoming second nature.  Dynamic perspective is awesome, firefly feature is amazing, and I love the unlimited cloud storage.<br/><br/>The 3D map feature is pretty cool too.  When you're in a new area, looking for an address, the addition of the buildings helps to identify your destination because you know, visually, what the building looks like.<br/><br/>The apps selection is limited, but I anticpate that to change.<br/><br/>Bottom line, the graphics are crisp and the clarity is great, the phone quality is excellent, the sound is amazing, camera is excellent, I am pleased with this phone.  I look forward to new features as they become available.
The phone for the most part is pretty cool, the dynamic perspective is amazing and the apps are cool. I also love the maps! It has all the major apps I want but  it isn't extremely app intensive like you would find with most androids.  Unfortunately, they missed the mark by not using apps like google drive and taking full advantage of the android market.  My biggest issue is the constant crashing the phone does.  Mayday agents can't even explain the issues.  Not to mention it doesn't work with my wireless up band.  I love the prime as well, but it doesn't do me much good if the phone crashes during videos, calls and app usage.
Just an awesome phone. Big but not too big. All kinds of motion activated features, and quick screens that can be swiped from all four edges. The Amazon prime trial it comes with entails TONS of free music to stream, super entertaining shows, and very simple to sync with Windows and Apple computers. I've had no complaints so far aside from a not so long lasting battery. But that may just be me because I always have this thing in my hands!
I got the 64 g from att yesterday, and its better then i thought it would be. By a long shot. First, google play is not only possible but its easy to get. Just change app settings on phone  download away . I had some bad feelings about the dynamic perspective.  Its amazing. Im in love with it. The talk sound quality  his superb, and the internet is way faster then my samsung galaxy s4. No back button is only reason i gave 4 stars .
I was a little worried getting the Fire cause all the bad reviews. I don't usually do reviews but had to cause it's a really good phone, I've re commended it to everyone. It's really easy to use and the Mayday feature is awesome. If you like Kindle you'll love this phone. Also the Amazon cloud is easier to use than I-cloud.just waiting for better cases to be available. If your worried about data usage you can easily set limits.
It's a nice Little phone. I owned the Samsung Mega and was used to the big screen. Also the app store doesn't have alto of the popular apps on it. You have the Amazon Prime set up for me but you have to purchase the movies or music you want but I am already paying for Amazon Prime. Paying for such a service should allow me the ability to download music and movies without having to pay for. I digress. Overall the phone is good.
Worthless can't down load the apps I need the lock screen started blinking then I got another one a month after I got it then 5 months later it does it again but this time it's worse lock screen freezes black have to hold 2 buttons to restart phone because screen is blacked out after restart it's normal phone has never hit ground or water has kool features but that's it if u use ur phone to pay bills this one won't so it sad
When I first got new phone (the fire phone) I was really happy with it. Email and Amazon were flawless as always and so was syncing my phone with my kindle. But then I looked at the wallpapers I liked some of them but at the same time some of them are dark and some may even describe a few as "creepy" but all in all the fire phone is a great deal with one year of Amazon prime and dynamic perspective. Well done Amazon!
I enjoyed having prime, but really it was a larger version of my kindle fire. It was not compatible with any of my apps from the iphone and made it very difficult to keep up with my daily events. Also, it would not display my call history or voicemails until an hour later. Then when i would attempt to put it on speaker, the buttons would jump and I would accidentally end a call. I had to return it.
I've been using the Fire for well over a month now.  That means I'm keeping it, like it or not.  And I do not like it.  But I'm keeping it because the phone has some functionality that assists me in my work - Firefly.<br/><br/>The Amazon Fire really only has one purpose.  Shopping.  That's it.  It excels at nothing else.  I'll give an honorable mention to free cloud storage for photos. That's really great.  And the camera is pretty nice . . . except it has a shutter lag that is simply unacceptable at times.<br/><br/>I've used multiple iPhones and Blackberries.  I don't expect a phone to have an OS that's necessarily perfect for me, but I expect it to have some logic and, most importantly, to be stable.  The Fire has neither.<br/><br/>First, let's start with a user friendly operating system.  Just a few examples:<br/><br/>To delete a message you swipe left.  Thing is, if you swipe left too close to the edge of the screen you pull out a separate menu.  The same action, just a fraction of inch apart on the screen, gives you two different results.  That's stupid.<br/><br/>If the keyboard is showing and you want to disappear you swipe up, not down.  You want the keyboard to go down so your brain is thinking down, not up.<br/><br/>Some actions take more steps than necessary.  To access a bookmark in the browser takes at least one extra step than you have to take on an iPhone.  No, not a deal breaker, but why do this?  Why add steps to the simple act of accessing a bookmark?<br/><br/>Overall stability and speed is an even bigger issue.<br/><br/>Just accessing the phone shows how slow the OS is.  When I punch my code into an iPhone 5s the phone can take whatever speed I'm entering the numbers.  Tap, tap, tap, tap . . . fast as I can and it works.  Not with the Fire.  I can get ahead of the phone without even trying.  I have to force myself to slow down while entering the code so that it actually takes.<br/><br/>Speaking of something taking effect . . . I touch a link in the browser.  And wait.  And wait.  I do it again.  Ah, that did it.  I've seen this error dozens of times.  Just because I touch something doesn't mean the phone will do what I say.  This isn't because I'm not touching hard enough.  I've checked the browser history and it shows that the last page visited was the link I just tried to access.  Except, I didn't access it. I'm still on the previous page.<br/><br/>Accessing a bookmark, besides having an extra step, is an extra joy.  I frequently have to swipe half a dozen times just to access the left side pull out menu.<br/><br/>Firefly, the top reason I bought this phone, works . . . most of the time.  Sometimes you get an error message that the server is busy.  Except it's not.  Every single time I've restarted the phone Firefly works immediately.  It's not the server, it's the phone.  But either way, it doesn't matter.  Firefly should work 99% of the time.  It doesn't.  If you use it dozens of times or more during a single day it will fail and you'll have to restart your phone.  Unacceptable.<br/><br/>Other issues:<br/><br/>The phone overheats as mentioned by others.  I can accept that.  Not a huge deal.<br/><br/>Dynamic perspective is a gimmick.  I can think of only a few practical uses for it, none of them major sellers to a general audience.<br/><br/>I'll give some points for battery life.  I've had better battery performance from the Fire than I did with my previous iPhone.<br/><br/>The tilt feature sounds cool, but it's actually more of a nuisance most of the time.<br/><br/>The phone comes with pre-sets that are just idiotic.  For example, you have to set up the phone to show battery life at the top of your screen.  Seems like asking if you want seat belts in your car.  Yes please.  It's a smartphone and that means it eats up power.  Of course I want to see the battery life available!  The pre-set should be for it to be seen.  I shouldn't have to freak out trying to figure out how to make it appear.<br/><br/>Which brings me to buying this from Amazon versus ATT.  When I got my phone my voicemail wasn't set up.  I mean, it wasn't even enabled.  When I contacted Amazon via email they tried to tell me my phone must be broken.  I took it to ATT.  They fixed it.  They told me Amazon never set up the phone for voicemail.  Thanks Amazon.<br/><br/>Wifi has been a joke.  My phone has very poor reception even compared to my much older iPhone 4 phone.  There are spots in my house where I have zero coverage.  Everything else works on those areas.  But not the Fire.  When I contacted Amazon they sent me a boilerplate email that was obvious they hadn't even read my message.  They said it was my router and I needed to turn it on and off.  No, it's not my router.  Amazon customer service for this phone, at least via email, totally sucks.<br/><br/>One of the reasons I considered the Amazon Fire was because I thought its closed environment would actually create more stability than your average Android.  I was willing to sacrifice the choices of a big app market in exchange for only apps that would work completely with the OS and not create conflicts.  Except, that's not what I got.  The Fire is very unstable - at least compared to any iPhone I've ever used.<br/><br/>A few weeks after I received the Fire it was obvious that the reviews were mixed at best and sales for Amazon were in the toilet.  They sent me a survey about the phone.  I thought, "Great, they're going to fix this!"  Instead the survey was about public relations and how they could improve awareness of the phone.  At this point Amazon had more than enough information to know their biggest task wasn't promoting the features the Fire had, but to fix the problems experienced by its customers so they weren't all PO'd and dissing the product.  That means fix the OS.  And if they can't fix their lame OS, start offering refunds.<br/><br/>The iPhone 6 came out and Amazon dropped their price down to 99 cents.  That's about the price where this phone belongs.<br/><br/>The primary purpose of this phone is to buy things - buy them from Amazon.  If they're not going to offer a rock solid and intuitive OS then basically this is about us giving Amazon more market data and more sales.  Yeah, we get a free year of Prime.  Thanks for that.  But I want my damn phone to be stable.  And I don't want to have to think hard about how to do basic tasks that other phones can easily handle.<br/><br/>Arrogance, laziness and apathy.  That's what I see from Amazon with this product which I now have committed to using for the next two years.  People slam Apple for many things.  Some of it they deserve, some of they don't.  I bristled at their closed in system that prevented me from getting apps I actually needed.  The fact that their phones have no expandable memory galls me.  But at the very least I had stability.  At least give me that.  Yes, at least give me that Amazon.  You owe me and other customers an apology, a refund and/or a better phone.  Barring that, I have to seriously question the future of this company.  This was a landmark product.  You want to join Apple and make a phone that rocks the market?  Then fix this fiasco you've created.  I won't hold my breath.
Amazon has done a great job with this phone, so far, apps work great and my phone doesn't have performance issues.  I have spent the last few days putting it through its paces and I haven't had any issues with it.  It's refreshing to see something other then IOS 7 and Android available, contrary to what others have said, this OS does have a future and it is ready for primetime.  This new OS reminds me of older versions of Linux Xwindows, its simple and doesn't rely on rich GUI and glitter to do the same job other OS's do.  This is something people aren't used to, its not pretty nor is it fancy, this is what people really dislike about it the most.  Since I grew up using web browsers like gopher which only showed text and no graphics, the missing glitter and fancy pants crap isn't an issue for me, but I know it is for others.  Other complaints are about apps like google not being available for the Amazon OS.  I say give it time, I'm sure there will be a version written for it.  I like google too, but you can always access it through the web browser.  (Problem solved.)  Give Amazon time to work out the bugs, don't jump on the hate band wagon because they aren't supporting every app or you can't figure out the OS.  Play with the phone a while and get used to its functions and how it operates, and for god sakes, give Amazon a chance to fix these issues, it was the same way with Android those problems aren't fixed over night!  Keep in mind as you read the reviews and also, read carefully, most people are ranting about apps not being available or the OS not looking or working to their liking.  Judge for yourself, not a load of complainers!  Then again, if everybody that wrote a review had a million dollars, they would find a reason to complain about that too.
Believe it or not, I survived until July 2014 without a proper smart phone.  My prior phone was a Samsung Evergreen with full slide out qwerty keyboard.  So if anyone is used to not having certain conveniences, it is I.<br/><br/>I got this phone the day it came out.  I was so excited about the dynamic perspective and tapping into the Amazon ecosystem.  I was already a prime member.  I thought the phone would provide me some different functionality from what I could get on my other apple products, and I was prepared for a different user experience.<br/><br/>I was stoked when I got the phone.  The display is beautiful.  The hardware is solid.  The camera is great.  It is a solid phone with clear call quality, and I can multi-task while talking.<br/><br/>What I can't do is... much else.  The primary disappointment-- no Uber, no Lyft, no FlyDelta, no Starbucks.  The main apps that I actually need on a phone for full benefit.  I could live without facebook and games on my phone (though those are available in the Amazon App store).  I work on a computer all day and have an iPad for games.  But not being able to get around, to have to geek out and sideload an Android Uber app which won't update automatically without my searching the web for a more current *.apk file-- that's not cool.<br/><br/>I waited patiently, thinking these apps would emerge in the first month.  They haven't.  And now there are new phones being announced making me jealous.<br/><br/>I am sad I wasted a 2 year contract renewal getting this phone.  And I paid the full $200 for it.  :(  I really don't want to spend 20 minutes searching on a relatively crappy Bing browser (remember, no Google apps whatsoever!) to get a ride home.
Really when I got the phone last year felt happy for the deal, afterwards, all the problems, battery drains out, handset heats up, worst, you will get calls, you won't be able to answer and only way you can talk is by turning on speaker phone, and although you have full connectivity, your calls will redirect to vm. Hangs up easily. Please go for some basic phone rather than this Fire phone. IT will set you on fire.
If you have cold hands this is a great phone for you because it heats up quickly, becoming very warm within the first minute of a phone call.  So I guess that's good for people with cold hands.<br/><br/>If you really like the way Apple locked down the apps store so you couldn't buy anything from anyone but them you'll also appreciate that Amazon doesn't allow you to install apps from Google Play.<br/><br/>If you wanted a very average to below average camera then this is the phone for you - it really delivers in mediocre quality!<br/><br/>The much vaunted peek left/right features work at least 25% of the time, so if you were hoping to be able to retry them until they work then you will have fun.<br/><br/>If you were tired of that know-it-all Siri always having answers and being able to set a timer or start an app then you will appreciate the limited functionality of whatever voice monster lives inside the fire.  It really can do almost nothing!<br/><br/>Are you tired of getting phone calls?  Because the antennae in this phone is evidently placed in such a way to make it not get coverage in places where normal iPhones and Galaxies get 4 bars.<br/><br/>It may seem like I think this is a bad phone, a bad smartphone, and a waste of money.  That's because that's exactly what I think. This phone is so crappy it's almost like they tried to make it awful.
Well it takes forever for a text to send , even with full service
I got this phone primarily for work and like it a great deal. Ease of use a plus. Comes with a great "notetaking" app, and excellent video capabilities. Enjoy the year of Prime membership, and also Prime Music. Also good selection of apps for almost any need. Additionally, the Mayday "Help" function is excellent. VERY satisfied with purchase and would recommend as alternative to iPhone.
If some of my favorite apps were available,  I would give it five stars.  There are a lot of apps,  but some of the ones I used all the time are not available,  the Starbucks app for one.  Also,  RockMyRun,  which is my favorite running music app.  There are other ones to chose from,  I just don't like them as well.  The phone itself is great and I like that I have all my Amazon features right there.
I have had this phone for a couple of weeks and have done more with it than any other phone I have owned.  It has some really neat and innovative features.  I didn't like that I had to switch from Verizon to AT&T; but oh well....they are both about the same.
As an Amazon only device I give the phone a two star rating. It's far too limiting. Why couldn't they find some way to incorporate Google apps by default? Luckily it's easy to side load all things Google including the Play store. I'm using Nova launcher and still have all the speed and stability of Fire OS. 5 minutes of reading and 10 minutes of doing makes this phone amazing and super versatile
Being a first generation phone and unique I was eager to buy and enjoy the uniqueness which never lasted long. The phone could get super warm on charging or using, would develop problems such as going off leaving you with no option. Most of the Android Apps are not on the phone hence makes it pretty hard to access what you want.Given other options quickly go for them unless the fire is improved
Absolutely the best phone I have ever had, I finally retired my Iphone 3, and have never looked back. Amazing clarity on pictures and videos. I love how the screen moves with me as I read, no more stopping to move to the next page. Super fast, I can access my college classes quicker with my Fire Phone then I can with my 6 month old laptop. I also love the 3 D images and games, go ceck it out.
I love this phone so much. I would definitely buy it again. It has a good camera, a great variation of music (which is very good for me). The only two things that make this phone not so wanted are #1 lack of apps and number #2 the fact that almost all phones that are not apple or samsung are out of the competition. But I personally would perfer this phone over and iphone any day.
Love it!
We have been really happy with this phone. We are an apple family so this is the first android based phone and we have a bit of a learning curve. We purchased this as a work phone for my husband to give him some privacy on his personal number. The ringer is loud enough to be heard, the usage is very user friendly and set up took very little time. All in all I am happy
I have had an I-phone 4 for two years. I did not have reception in my townhouse most of the time, with the exception of the upstairs bedroom.  I had to be standing by the window for good reception.  I have to say other than that, I loved my I-phone.  I picked up my Amazon Fire phone yesterday (Friday) and so far I love it.  I have reception inside my townhouse, and made and received several calls.  All of my kindle books were already on my phone, and I clicked on one, and started reading.  My Google email and contacts were added easily.  I added a few apps and overall it was smooth and easy to adapt to my needs.  My only complaint was the quality of photos taken with the camera.  Not a deal breaker.
The promotional deal of .99 cents to get the phone was an absolute steal. I love the Gorilla glass encasement, but I only wish that the screen was larger and the size of the font when texting was larger. It is a cute phone, but it at times can be a little confusing to get back to a certain screen and I find the camera to be a nuisance in the sense that the button is rather sensitive so it is always coming on and taking random photos. I guess I will eventually figure out how to operate this equipment.
Only my 2nd smart phone, (the 1st lasted 3 weeks) and a 10x improvement in power, capacity, and even ease of use. Since I am new to the cyber world, and not getting any younger, facility is very important to me. The Fire Phone, together with my new Fire HDX, offer possibilities that extend to the limits of my comprehension, all within my capabilities.
This is a great device, it has everything it's competitors do + features they don't. It isn't a Galaxy, or an iPhone, which means the publications and pundits won't like it and won't promote it, b/c if it isn't an iPhone they don't care. However, I find this device to be superior to either. Standard 32gb [awesome], camera works nicely and takes clean pics w/o too many settings to fumble with, Firefly is awesome and as the content only grows, will be even better. Dynamic perspective is also super interesting and again, as SDK's are released and devs start submitting apps, games, etc... it will be easier to realize its potential. Free Prime for a year and unlimited phot0storage on the cloud are things nobody else can offer. I look forward to this phone integrating with FireTV, Audible, Kindle, streaming music and prime content as they grow respectively. great device, has everything the others do, plus features they don't.
I love the Firefly app! It has saved me so much money, I am a college student and every penny counts.It takes amazing photos, and the sound is better than any phone I have had. I love how easy it connects to my FireTV so that I can show people the photos I took from my phone instantly on my TV. I prefer my Fire Phone over my old iPhone any day.
I am a former Samsung 4 and iPhone 4S user and switched to the Fire Phone recently.  By far the best feature is the Fire OS as it is clear, streamlined, and very easy to use.  There is a consistency within the native applications which I appreciate and tilting the phone either way brings up menus within each application.  Highly recommended to watch the "Getting Started" video which you will see as you turn on the phone as this tilting feature is not obvious at first.<br/><br/>The dynamic perspective feature is wonderful as the buttons seem to "float" on the screen.  When this perspective feature is used on the lock screen, it allows you to appear to look down hallways, around balloons.<br/><br/>Some nice touches to the contact app is that when you touch a given contact, the photo for that person will get larger-it's fun.<br/><br/>The calendar app works very well with google and is actually easier to use, and does not include a lot of extraneous buttons.<br/><br/>The weather app is beautiful and, unlike 3rd party apps on Google play, you don't have to look at ads that stream across the bottom of the page.<br/><br/>The settings page is intuitive and easy to use.<br/><br/>Yes, there are not nearly as many apps as Google Play or iTunes which is a hindrance but I don't need 100 different clock apps or 100 different note taking apps-maybe I do actually need them?<br/><br/>All the other reviews have focused on the "gee-whiz" features of the phone but, to me, it appear that the engineers have looked at the Android OS and iOS and tried to streamline both of these operating systems to the most essential features, gotten rid of extra buttons, rarely used features.  The end result is a efficient, well done operating system and interface that saves me time, and, in the end, allows me to get things done with fewer "clicks" and "taps"
Although this phone is not without its faults, like all technology, it is still a work horse. I am able to quickly transition from task to task, keep all my appointments organized, and load apps and web pages at lightning speed. The bad about this phone is the battery life. Keep your charger with you, the phone also seems to get really hot.
I have to admit I was EXCITED to have another Kindle product.  Being an Amazon junkee and all, this was like Christmas in July....WOW what a let down for me.  When your 3G SIII Mini is easier to maneuver than this phone, that says something.  Graphics - BEAUTIFUL!  Camera photos - WONDERFUL....having to shake, flick, move your hand to have your phone advance - TERRIBLE!!  Ability to change ringtones to songs?  Non existent.  Back button?  Not found....oh wait, there it is....you have to quickly flick your finger to have it show up for 2 seconds....uh oh, it's gone now....bank app locks you out when you can't return to your main screen with a back button.  MUST be able to bank via cell due to the fabulous Baracuda internet web locks at my day job.  Solution per Mayday?  Reload app after clearing cache and reload....there you are back button....oh wait....2 seconds later, gone again.  After 48 of frustration, RETURNED to AT&T.;  Hello HTC One G8.  Instantly in love.  And BEWARE - Yes you can return your phone to AT&T; if you are not satisfied...prepare to pay a 35.00 restocking fee.  Please know that just because it didn't satisfy me, it might YOU.  I am just a android fan and will continue to be ,even though my Kindle Fire HD is the bomb!!
Awesome phone. Only downfall is the limited app store.
I love this phone. It's simply amazing. I would recommend this phone to any age group. It's light, slim, and fits comfortable in my hand unlike other smartphones. I love the fact that you get an additional year on prime and the fact it comes already with all the amazon apps. I think this was the best purchase of a phone I've ever made =)
The phone has been great. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because lack of access to Google Play store. While the Amazon App store does have most of the major apps that I use on my other android devices, there are a few missing. That being said, the quality of the phone is great, the camera takes excellent pictures and video
I am terribly disappointed in this phone.  It isn't a bad phone.  It does a lot.  I liked that I got a year of Amazon Prime for free.  It isn't worth it though.  The problem is that I don't have the Google Play Store and the apps that I was able to use when I had the HTC One.  The speakers are nowhere as good as the HTC One.  It looks cheap next to the HTC One.  I am still using my HTC One because the apps became indispensable to me.  So now I use 2 phones, my HTC wirelessly for the apps and the Amazon Fire phone because Audible doesn't crash on me like it did on the HTC One.  I REALLY wish that I had just gotten a newer HTC One.
People, take a few minutes to learn this phone. Any bad reviews are just people who haven't took the time to learn. It is a great phone for syncing with other Amazon devices, I have a fire TV, and 3 kindles for my kids. Music app is better than itunes, as long as you are a Prime user, same with movies. Way better than my old iPhone!
I love my Fire Phone. It is the first smart phone I have ever owned. I decided to get it because I already have a Kindle Fire, and I love that as well. The only problem was when I cracked the screen, I had to get the whole phone replaced as no one could just replace the screen (luckily I had it insured). It was a bit of a nuisance.
I have had my Fire phone for about a month now and I am very pleased.  We also have Kindle's and we love the way they interact and<br/>how easy having that knowledge helped me know how to use most everything on the phone.  How much easier could it be when you have Mayday available and can talk to a real person with any questions.
I have had this phone 11 months and regretted getting it from the beginning and have only become more and more frustrated! Apps are limited to choose from and any useful app is not an option. The tilt feature works when I don't want it to and doesn't work when I do! I usually keep phones for a few years but I'm over this phone!
I absolutely love the graphics and 3d effects. I do not like that it doesn't let me get to my games that I played on my iPhone. I think if it would allow you to download and use the Google play store, then I could get to my games. I really do like the phone otherwise. I just am really disAppointed that I can't play Hay day! :(
I really love this phone. I don't know or care why people haven't given it positive reviews. The main inconvenience of the phone is that it doesn't allow you to get Google play services, but you can sideload the apps, and using this method I now have Google play services. There is a beautiful camera and great sound quality.
There are minor differences in the smart phones I have grown accustomed to in my past, but this phone also has additional features that my other phones didn't have, so I'm quite pleased. I mostly enjoy the fact that Amazon offered the phone for .99¢, & provided my family with the instant videos for free, for an entire year.
This phone isn't compatible with a lot of apps.  It's really difficult to transition from being an iphone user to this phone.  I don't want to completely disregard this phone, as it is so new, but they need to get the ball rolling a little bit on the apps.  Also- it has a tendency to freeze and I have to restart the phone.
I went from an IPhone 3 to the Amazon Fire Phone. I find the Fire phone very easy to use and navigate, I am just really disappointed in the limited number of apps that are available. I can't find my medical group or my bank in the app store. Also the variety of games is very limited. Other then that it's a great phone.
The app store is a joke. You have to go through the browser for YouTube. No app! Phone freezes all the time. The mic is apparently tiny because if I'm not holding the phone perfectly nobody can hear me. The final straw was traveling out of state on vacation and the SIM card disappears off the network leaving me stranded without a working phone. I work for ATT and was given this phone as my company phone not by choice. Amazon should be ashamed of themselves.
Has anyone else plugged this phone in to charge it and almost burn your hand on the charger? Please I need to know because if that is a no then both of my chargers need to be replaced. I made sure to charge through a surge protector just in case. Please let me know. I love the phones just worried about the chargers.
I like the way I can sync my fire phone and fire tablet. Perfect for my needs. Only fault I've found is battery runs out quick and sometimes phone feels hot not just warm. This hasn't been a big problem though. Reasonable price. I would recommend this phone for those who want a smart phone but have a tight budget.
There are still some updates that need to happen but overall the phone has come a long way since release.<br/>Voice controls are a bit laggy and not able to add calendar events or answer some basic questions.<br/>Amazon stands behind their products and that's why I will stay with them through the growing pains.
Love it - virtually no bloat ware!!  I have used this phone for almost 6 months now and have found it to be flawless.<br/>I am bewildered about the negative reviews...<br/>I am very suspicious of media reviews since the biggest companies buy the most ads, they are probably  biased in favor of its products...
I was looking for a change from iphone after become less and less enchanted by each model that had come out. Plus, both ours iphones were starting to fail--my phone would shut off at 35% battery life and my wife's power button would not work at all. When the fire phone was announced, we broke our contracts and started new ones to get the phones. We got the phones day one in July and in October we found ourselves switching back to our old broken iphones. Although only after a few months, our phones we had been using for nearly 2yrs previously felt like brand new phones compared to our experience with the fire phone! We were so frustrated by the buggy interface, boring app selection, and unnecessary features--all of which I realized the first week. I honestly don't have anything to say positive about the fire phone, which is irritating because I love amazon and their products. I've owned a few kindles and a fire tv and they've all been great and impressive. I don't know how they could have been so wrong about the phone. Maybe they'll get it right on the next one.
I'm loving my fire phone. It is doing everything I wanted and more. It's missing a couple of things that every other phone has had, such as an alarm and calculator. I may just be missing those things, but oh well. It is a little daunting running a completely new O.S. But I'm enjoying my experience so far.
So far I have really enjoyed this phone. There are Manu small things that have made it fun to use. The only reason it isn't getting a 5 star rating is because of some of the apps that it is missing. I know this isn't Amazon's fault but I feel as though it should offer a few more of the most popular apps.
I have been an iPhone girl since iPhones came out but decided to try the fire phone and have to say that I am in love!  The keyboard is tons better.  Love firefly.  Auto correct is better. The fire phone is super user friendly, the one time I tried to switch to an android I couldn't figure out in 2 weeks!  I had this phone down pat in 30 minutes!  The camera is great.  I love everything about this phone so far.
I don't understand the bad reviews on this. It works great and does everything most smart phones do and more. The camera is awesome. I love firefly. Love this phone. Only slightly negative comment would be that  battery could last a bit longer, but it is adequate. Not fond of google apps anyhow so don't miss them. The earbuds that come with the phone are the most comfortable and best sounding I have ever had.
I am liking this phone, especially as someone who fully uses the benefits of Amazon Prime.<br/><br/>Some reviewers may call the interface overly complicated, but I'd just call it different.  Once you learn it, it actually makes sense and is very easy to use.  The real problem with learning how to use this phone is more or less the challenge of breaking out of the 'muscle memory' reflexes of using your old phone.<br/><br/>All of my major apps are already on the market.  If you aren't comfortable with buying the phone without first seeing what's on the market for it (a problem I've had with past phones), you can go into the Google Apps department of the site and filter for Fire Phone apps.  My experience thus far has been, if it's there, then it works on the phone.<br/><br/>I -LOVE- the build of this phone.  It's heavy.  Every smartphone I've ever bought seems to have struggled with making a 'lighter, more paper-thin' phone -- you know, the kind of phone that you forget is there, gets easily broken, and slips right out of your hand.  This phone has the dimensions of a modern smartphone, but feels like a brick.<br/><br/>One word of caution -- the battery seems to drain incredibly fast (not surprisingly).  I charged this phone before using it, and it had dropped to 75% while I was still going to through the tutorials, adding apps, and checking my contacts.
I love this phone the battery life is awesome, and all it features and dont have borrow my daughters kinddle tablet to play games, one thing that I would have love its that amazon would have the emoji app to use emotion on my conversation like everybody else, but I hope you guys are working on it.
Umm..... I like it and I don't. I switched over from Sprint just to get this phone because I liked it when it was on display. If I was smarter, I'd keepthe amazon app on my Samsung phone and stick with it. If only amazon would just make a deal with Google to have the apps we use on a daily basis, this phone would be much better. I'm on the verge of paying my early termination fee and just taking a loss with this phone. I'm probably the only one who still has the phone. Good try tho. Just not competitive enough with all the phones out there.
I am finally able to admit that I really dislike this phone.  I love my kindle and thought from everything I had read that I would love this phone as much.  I do NOT!!  I hate that I can't get apps that are not by amazon.  I miss snap chat!!  Anytime someone sends me an emoticon from another phone, it comes across like a symbol that's a cross between a rat and a cock roach.  My pictures won't fit right on my lock screen.  The calendar alarms are very limited and they don't truly alarm.  I love the dynamic perspective. I even enjoy the firefly on occasion.  Outside of that, I'm just not real thrilled.  I have tried very hard to convince myself that this phone is good, but, I give up.  It's just not what I expected.
Great phone, it has many interesting features such as firefly and the photos resolution. I just wish the phone has more compatibility with more android apps but i guess that's why the ask for feedback  so they can incorporate them to amazon store and avoid malicious apps that are out there
I really like this phone. At least, so far. Haven't really had much time to "test" it out. BUT the very very very very very first thing I noticed was when I began to add apps to it, that I had on my previous iphone, a LOT are not available. Okay...I figured no Youtube, or Chrome, etc...because its made by amazon and their app store isn't going to "promote the competition". What I don't get, is some of the other apps. No walmart savings catcher, No speedway, No Ibotta, No JoAnn fabrics, No Hobby Lobby, No Square Register. The really big ones here for me are speedway (as I no longer have a physical speedway card...I rely on the app to provide my card) and Joanns for all the "app coupons". The rest I can just off the old phone when I get home.<br/><br/>I "can" bring my old phone with me wherever I go as well as the Fire phone. Create a wifi hotspot, tether to it with the old iphone...then use the apps I need to use. but that is extremely inconvenient....EXTREMELY. I should not have to carry around 2 phones with all the time because one doesn't have service and the one that does, can't do 80% of the things I need it to do on a regular basis. All the neat little gadgets like firefly etc, are neat but if I can't do what i NEED it to do...who cares about the little things like that, that make no real significant difference?<br/><br/>I'm REALLY hoping that amazon comes out with more apps. Its not even so much the phone...its their darn app store. 250K apps apparently and I'm not interested in the least for about 249,995 of them. The apps I need are for physical stores, gas stations...etc. Square reader is also a BIG one...seriously. None of these are made or owned by what should be considered a competitor. They NEED to be made available.<br/><br/>Square Reader is an app for those, like me, who have a square account on squareup.com. Through this app, I can accept credit cards as a method of payment at my market stand using a reader that plugs into the headphone jack. I'll WILL have to use my iphone for this now as I refuse to lose business simply because the fire can't get it through the amazon app store.<br/><br/>Amazon...my only and initial complaint at moment at least is the amount of apps. You need a LOT and I mean a LOT more apps and pronto.
So, I read the reviews, the negative reviews bf I bought the phone, but I got it anyways. I figured I had 14 days to figure out if I wanted to keep it or not.  After almost 3 weeks of having the phone, the only thing I regret is not getting the 64 gb phone.  I love my kindle and the apps I have, so I figured I would at least like the Fire phone.  Since I didn't have overly high expectations as some reviewers seemed to have, I am quite pleased with the phone.<br/><br/>Some negatives with the phone is you can't access the Google Play Store. If your phone doesn't have it already installed, then you can't get it because it's not downloadable (which is junk).  I had to look to see if the apps I use pretty regularly was available on Amazon.  That would have been a deal breaker.  Yeah, it would be nice to have the Shop Your Way Rewards app, but it took up a lot of space and I don't need, need it.  I forget already what other apps I couldn't find on the Amazon app store.  But there have been some I wanted but they were only available on iTunes or Google Play. Oh, there's no Zedge app, but I can download direct from their site.<br/><br/>One thing I absolutely hate, hate, hate is that I can't customize my ringtones. I used to personalize for my family and friends.  I also hate that I can't just swipe people's names to call them. I have to go to their name and the click either call or text. With my old Samsung, I could just go to a person's text message and swipe their name to start a phone call.  I guess I have to find out if there's a more extensive user guide to see if I can program speed dial #'s and see what other ways to customize the phone. For my alarms, I downloaded an alarm app where I can customize the notification tones (use ones I downloaded from Zedge).  This app also serves as a radio (streams different genre stations from all over the world).<br/><br/>The ringtones choices need to be better.  They pretty much all sound the same -- like bells.  Like phone ringing bells.  I think there's only 1 that actually sounds like a song.<br/><br/>So overall, I like the phone. It's not too big like the other choices I had. It came with free Prime which I still haven't used yet. There have been pitfalls to no Google Play Store and limited phone capabilities, but there maybe ways around it if you're willing too look for it.  Hope this helps someone.  It's all about what your preferences are ...and what's important to you ...
This is a great phone, highly underrated. The most things that people complain about is the lack of apps. It has plenty, but they could add a few more of the most popular ones. It takes great pictures, is super fast, and I have no problems with lag or it freezing up at all.
I have enjoyed my phone. I do wish it had an indicator/notification light to show when an email or message has been received and a way to delete an email from the handset only without deleting it from the in-box too. Those are two things I really miss about my Blackberry.
At first I didnt know if I was going to like my Fire phone but the more I use it the more I love it. It will do anything I want and then some . I learn more about it every day and have not found anything my daughters I Phone 6 can do that I cant . I am very satisfied.
Great phone. I was kind of afraid at first, maybe skeptical is a better word, but as soon as I got this phone, I immediately fell in love. It's no iPhone, and no Samsung galaxy but for what it is and what is consists of, it is a great phone that anyone should love.
My wife brought this phone home for me instead of the new Galaxy.  At first I must say I was disappointed primarily because of having my mind set on the galaxy and knowing nothing about the fire phone.  I have been using the phone for about 3 weeks now and I must say I am impressed.  The phone is well made has a comparable processor to all of the other top of the line phones on the market as well as RAM.  It app market is pretty extensive not quit as good as Android or apples yet but getting ther.  One of the biggest perks to the phone is it came with a free one year subscription to Amazon Prime which would ordinarily cost you $185.00 for a one year subscription.  This makes thousands of  free downloads available from songs to movies, kids shows even some audio books.  Also adds and additional discount to many of the products for sale on Amazon as well as free 2 day shipping.  To me this is a great perk and a hell of a sales pitch from Amazon to help sell the phone.  Truly at this time.the only 2 cons I have found are 1: there is no MicroSD slot to expand storage on the phone and you can eat up 32gigs pretty quick with the ability to download free movies and songs and 2: there are not any major name brand case companies manufacturing a good quality case like life proof or otter box so the risk to someone like myself who is notorious for breaking his smart phones pretty high with no real options to protecting it.  Other than that I would defiantly recommend this phone can't wait to see if they keep up with the product like they have the Kindles and see if some of the after market companies jump aboard in the manufacturing after market cases and accessories.
Love this phone.  Of course I am a huge Amazon freak so it's right up my alley!  Good call clarity, battery life, awesome screen resolution.  Like the camera.  I also like people stopping me to ask..Hey how many cameras are in that thing!  Favorite phone ever!
No problems with the phone. Works great.
Why do people hate this phone so much? I mean it does have it's bugs but overall the phone works great for me.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>Excellent Picture and Video Quality<br/>1 year Amazon Prime<br/>Amazing Audio<br/>Base Apps (apps that come with the phone) sync completely with everything you do on Amazon<br/>Sturdy Build<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Buggy sometimes apps would close randomly although rarely<br/>Battery life is lacking but it's not a nuisance<br/><br/>Other than that the phone works great just needs a few updates and it can compete with the elite phones on the market today.
I pre-ordered this phone after reading some preliminary reviews and seeing some of the videos.  I was eagerly anticipating it.  However, once I received it and began playing around with it, I became quickly disappointed.<br/><br/>I was using a Samsung Galaxy, so there was a bit of a learning curve getting used to the new OS.  That wasn't too bad.  I prefer the button placement on the Galaxy though.  The Fire doesn't have any buttons on the right side, which is odd, if you are right-handed. You can't grab it with one hand and power it on and begin using it.  My opinion, but I expect many others would feel this way too.<br/><br/>The main reason I am returning the phone is the horrible app selection.  I am a runner and use my phone to track my runs.  This is the make-or-break app category for me. I am currently using nikeplus to track my runs, so I was disappointed to see that it wasn't available.  I was even more surpised to see that RunKeeper and Endomondo weren't there either.  However the lack of  ANY OTHER RUNNING APP was the complete deal breaker.  Searching for 'run/run app/running' yields a plethora of Temple Run, Granny Run, Toilet Paper run, etc apps.  so if you like that kind of thing, you are all set.<br/><br/>Many, many other apps are also not available... anyone ever hear of LinkedIn? MyFitnessPal?<br/><br/>I think the phone has a chance of being better in a year once there are more apps, but it will always trail iphone and android phones for app selection.  Why did they fork the code again???  Why not release the SDK earlier?<br/><br/>EPIC FAIL
I love this phone. I was worried because there are a lot of bad reviews online for this phone, but I've found it to be a great device. It's like a smaller, even better kindle that also makes phone calls. I should have known that Amazon always delivers!
It may grow to a five star rating once it has met the test of durability- which, of course, takes time. I am satisfied as to its ease of use and its capacity for app features. In terms of style, it has a high quality of design. Downright beautiful.
As a base level phone (.99 with contract) this phone can't be beat.  I had no problem with app availability, though I did side load a couple. I did not find the lack of Google apps a problem but I've never been heavy into the Google environment.
I read all the reviews before I purchased this phone. I am so glad I bought it. This phone does more than I expected. The quality of the camera is amazing, I love the little extra features and most of all the easy access to Amazon and my books.
I love my phone, but I don't like that I don't have the back button to come out of pages. Swiping up to come out is a nuisance and I keep accidentally swiping something on the bottom of the page. This is frustrating. I also miss google.
I love my Kindle Fire, so I chose the phone. As a phone, it is okay. The camera is pretty good. The real selling point to the phone was the year of amazon prime. Hopefully getting more interesting apps added will make this phone better.
Loving it. I have Galaxy Note 3 and used iPhone before but quality of Fire phone is amazing. Crystal clear sound, Photo/picture quality is the best (I took same picture from my Note 3 and with Fire phone, by far Fire phone's quality is better). WiFi is great as well. There are many small features, which makes your life very easy. That is what I love about Amazon products, which other companies are not focusing. Amazon probably has lot to improve on but for a first phone launch you can't get anything better. Way to go Amazon !!!
I love the picture quality of my fire phone. Wish I could sync my iTunes music in a more accessible way. And I miss the emoticons??!! I hope an update with emoticon features will be available soon. All in all I am enjoying the phone.
Allow me to first preface this review by saying that I got the phone the last day it was being sold at $130 which included prime membership. I am a phone junkie I have had iPhones,many android phones, Windows phones, flip phones you name it. I love phones!!! I couldn't believe there were rumors about this phone coming out and then when it was announced I was blown away by the price I thought for sure it was going to be a bad idea. However saying all that the phone is really nice. They could've done away with the dynamic perspective it is just a waste of precious battery and jacked up the price of the phone unnecessarily. It works great with my fire stick and the voice dictation is very good. It's refreshing and fun to use the phone. The camera is about as good as my wife's LG G3 just not as fast on focusing.It reminds me somewhat of iPhone with the home button I like that I can't stand the way Samsung set up with the home button and the other two buttons, very confusing. Hopefully Amazon will do a follow up with like a mid range phone that doesn't have the dynamic perspective. So other than that this things great! I have had it for a few weeks now hasn't given me any troubles just a few superminor hiccups like any other phone.The only con I can say is the speaker phone could be a little bit louder and the speakers could be a little bit less tinny, but what do you expect for a $30 phone.other This thing is anawesome I believe that I'm gonna call it my 30 Dollar iPhone. ha ha
I'm pleased with my Fire Phone still learning to use it. Love the May day. The only criticism I have is a printed quick start guide for the Tech Challenged would be very helpful. It's a truly great phone I continue to be impressed.
I'd been using my phone for over a month now and have absolutely no complaints! I will admit that this is my first smartphone but have several Kindle readers!. I have used Mayday and love the service! I highly recommend this phone!
It's not prefect, not being able to use Google apps is an undeniable downside, however the phone works well, beautiful screen, great camera fast user friendly operation.  If you're an Amazon user this phone will suit you just fine.
Love it, better than the Iphone I had, Better pictures and better screen. love the zoom too. The flip to turn the page is great when reading a book . My wife is switching from her Iphone 5 to Fire since she has checked out my FIRE.
I haven't owned the Fire phone for too long yet but so far I love it. It is so much fun plus it works great! Good reception everywhere. Long lasting battery. The only problem so far is that I can't find accessories in any stores.
I love my fire phone I've been using it for 8 months now and I love it every day more. everything work just perfect the battery life, the features,...etc  and it still look like I got it today I just ordered a wallet case for it
this is a good phone like the size but is a disappointment as that it doesn't have some of the items I want on it, no facetime, no adding ringtones or changing the wallpaper, some of my games, maybe will update some of the items. doesn't slide like it says but maybe that is me, still learning it
I would like to see the fire phone 2 please... lol and I'd hope it has SMS. That's my ONLY complaint. Firefly needs improvement too but eh, whatever, it's a commodity. It's not iOS or Android. Thank you for options Lord, Mwah.
I love this phone. It does everything well. I even love the silly 3D features. I was amazed by Mayday. So far everything I've done with the phone worked the first time, apps load quickly, the phone quality is great, it's easy to use and the interface is nicely optimized. Its main disadvantage is the lack of apps. So far no Uber, and no Zagat, those are the 2 that I miss the most. My guess is that Amazon will move quickly to bridge this gap, because other than that, this phone has made me a believer.
Fantastic and terrific gadget. Please wait for two years before making the fire phone 2. Or call it fire echo 2, with a little bite of echo function like the Bluetooth. I wish I could get the echo Bluetooth .Great job amazon.
So far the phone works great. My only complaint would be a lot of apps I used and loved aren't available. But I have noticed a few are making their way to the app store and that's great. Definitely love the prime membership.
Most awesome phone.<br/><br/>I got this when it went on sale for $169, including a year of Prime.<br/><br/>I didn't really care about the phone and what it could or couldn't do, I just wanted a cheap backup phone that was unlocked.<br/><br/>It looked pretty neat when I first tried using it. I liked the geo-spatial perspective of the lock screen and maps and the OS reminded me a little of Palm's OS before they went under.<br/><br/>No access to Google Play was a bit disconcerting because most of the apps on the Amazon app store are s***e and I was not happy that I wasn't able to use my recently acquired Asus Zenwatch; but hey - it's just a back-up phone and will do quite nicely for $69.<br/><br/>Then I sideloaded Google services and the Play Store and it turned into my favorite and most awesome phone of all time.<br/><br/>The Zenwatch works perfectly with it. When I use Google Maps to navigate, my wrist buzzes to notify me of every upcoming turn. I can speak into it for Google Now or Google Translate with excellent results.<br/><br/>When you combine this with the fantastic and revolutionary Firefly app and the excellent camera with unlimited straight to cloud storage and beaming content directly to your smart TV, you have a truly, convergent, super device!<br/><br/>Oh yeah - Amazon lowered the price to $130, so I asked them to refund the difference - and they did!<br/><br/>A device like this for $30 - get outta town!!<br/><br/>I'm sorry for anyone who missed the boat on this one -
Although it's not as popular as the iPhone or the galaxy. It's still a very nice phone. The May Day button is very exciting to use. I also loved that I got Amazon Prime for a year. It's may be a bit confusing to use at first but once you use it for a while you'll get used to it. I love it.
Very good phone, very easy to use.
i bought this phone for my 14 year old son after he dropped his LG3....we are both happy with the durability of the fire phone.  we love the 3d that it displays and for me, it is very easy to work.  5 stars hands down!!
Fun to use. Excellent battery life (with the new firmware update). Love to use Dynamic Perspective, Firefly, and Prime. The only downside is that to be able to use Firefly you need a cell signal - which you probably won't have if you're in a store. Firefly needs offline functionality.
All and all this is a good phone. I just wish it had the same apps available as the kindle fires like my local weather stations and a few other ones. Hopefully they will be getting more like the google play store soon.
Compared to all the phones I have had in the past it's got to be the best, obviously this is a new phone and it may have some minor minor issues. It is still a top of the line phone and I would recommend it to anyone!!
Highly recommended especially for anyone who has a Prime Amazon account and uses kindle apps.  This is only my second smart phone, but I am very pleased with the advanced technology and the ease of use--great product.
Me and my wife was due for an upgrade through AT&T; and we had an iPhone 4s.My wife hates Apple products and for me it was my first smartphone.The iPhone 4s was nothing to write home about,it dropped calls,while on Facebook it would go back to main screen,phone would get very hot.So no I wasn't impressed by the iPhone 4s either.My wife and I met my daughter at our AT&T; store to get her an upgrade and well we we're due for one to so went to looking around and that's when we saw the display for the Amazon Fire Phone.Well I started drooling because yes I am an avid shopper on Amazon and love their service.So we looked at the phone did the tutorial on it and so far so good we we're impressed by the Fire phone BUT we wanted to do more research on it.So we read a lot of reviews on this phone from the pros to the customers,we read so much our head spun.Not that we we're afraid of committing to the Fire phone,but wanted to be sure that THIS was our next smartphone.After all the reviews we read I was sold hook line and sinker.We have now owned the Fire phone for about a month and it works great. All the features are awesome and work great,the phone doesn't get hot like some reviewers say.We've had no dropped calls or any issues at all with Amazon Fire phone.So if your worried don't be this is a GREAT smartphone and we will buy Amazon smartphones as long as Amazon makes them.
Battery is substandard loses it's charge extremely fast and get's to hot when charging. App market leaves a lot to be desired. Clarity and camera are top notch. Should consider a app deal with Google so much more to choose from.Prime music and video are super clear that being said now contemplating sticking with it.
I got my Fire Phone through AT&T; and they were pretty neutral in the store about it but my experience has only been positive.<br/><br/>The phone is sleek, responsive and just does its job.  As a phone, it just works and contact management is intuitive and sensible.  For the apps I care about, they are present and they work or there is an Amazon alternative (e.g. maps) that performs smoothly and fills my needs.<br/><br/>Incidentally, it isn't mentioned much even in the positive reviews but if you care about such things the camera is surprisingly good at low-light photos, a common weak point for phone cameras.<br/><br/>The integration with Amazon services is deep and genuinely useful.  As an example, an attempt to buy something that Prime discounts is quickly and clearly marked; a thoughtfulness that I appreciate.<br/><br/>The only warning I might give is if there is some app you feel you just can't live without, make sure it is present on the Amazon App store before you buy.  For myself I came from Android so I understand exactly what I'm missing; I just don't care.  Amazon delivers a fine product on this Fire Phone, I love it and I would totally buy another one if it got lost or went through the washing machine or something.
I am  in awe of the Amazon Fire Phone.  It didn't take too long to learn to navigate and now I'm a pro.  The screen, camera, and audio are awesome.  It's almost like having a mini Kindle at my disposal 24/7.  I knew from the moment I first saw this phone that it would be exceptional because I own 2 Kindle Fire's and Amazon Fire TV that are superb.  Amazon always takes the idea a step or two further than other products of the same caliber.  You won't be sorry for owning this phone...you'll be proud to have one.
I have been a Kindle user for 5 years and have been very satisfied with the line. I am on my 3rd Kindle. When the phones came out I knew I wanted one. I just got it in November, I love it!
I have always been intrigued by new and innovative technologies.  I was drawn to the Fire Phone because I have never been comfortable with the typical Android experience.  I always found other Android phones messy and disorganized compared to the iPhone (or even Windows phones).  Fire's OS seemed cleaner and easier to use.<br/><br/>I've had the phone about 5 days, and I find that the build quality is excellent.  The screen, while not super-high-resolution, is serviceable, and bright.  Pictures and videos look fine.  I really like the interface, and find it understandable, well-organized, and easy to use.  Firefly works pretty well - and, given that I am a Prime junkie, is a great way to get things to the door faster and easier.  Dynamic Perspective is a gimmick, though I am sure that developers could really take advantage of it, if there was any market to do so.<br/><br/>Therein lies the rub.  I often land up with dead-end technology (can you say "WebOS from HP?").  I am afraid that, if I keep the phone, nobody is ever going to develop anything really interesting for it, and it will pretty much stay at its current state.  That said, there isn't anything on the market that excites me either, so I would just land up going back to my HTC One (M7) for a time.  This isn't my primary phone anyway (I have an iPhone for day-to-day use), so the fact that it doesn't do everything is OK.  That said, if I am ever tempted to get an Android Wear watch, then my Fire Phone won't be much help, unless I can side-load the app.
I got this phone and omg I love it if I don't know what song is on firefly tells me what's song it is and the pictures it takes Ce out better then the iPhone so me it's worth the money
I love my new phone. Its very innovative and has some really cool features. Only thing Im finding is that the screen freezes and sometimes when your typing the keyboard comes up blank.
Before I start, I want to mention that I bought 2 of these phones for 2 users in my mobile share data plan and we saw the same behavior for both the phones that were sent to us. So this should be universally true.<br/>Pros: Dynamic perspective, Firefly and Mayday are all exceptional and out of the box products<br/>Cons: Below is an entire list<br/>1. The sound from the speaker of the phone is not clear, crisp and loud the way it is in other smart phones.<br/>2. After getting this phone and using it for the entire week, I have heard from a number of people that my voice is breaking or there is a disturbance on my end. This never happened when I was using my samsung S4<br/>3. The apps keep on crashing again and again. I have installed Whats App and Good more than 5 times but it still behaves the same way.<br/>4. Worst part: After using the phone for just 5-10 minutes (just browsing various apps) you'll feel the phone turning warmer<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of Amazon and hence I want for this product but for me it was a complete letdown by the makers. We appreciate smart and cool features but not at the cost of sacrificing the basic functionality of the product. Will return it to AT&T; and go for HTC One M8 or Iphone 5S
Yeah, it's awesome...  I've owned a Samsung, a Moto, a BB, and about every other phone out there...  Amazon did their homework on this one! Wow!<br/><br/>Mayday is fantastic and don't believe the bs... The Appstore has EVERYTHING you could want.  This phone is amazing and it will only get better with each software upgrade.<br/><br/>Great quality throughout.  Very stable and smooth...
Amazon dropping the phone makes it unlikely that developers will publish on the amazon app store, making the phone essentially irrevalent. Would never buy any future Amazon hardware!
I really wanted to like this phone. However after using it for the last week here are my thoughts.<br/>Not worth the $ even with the free year of prime.<br/>It is slow to respond at times. Especially noticeable when loading the music player.<br/>Since there is not a back button the only way to back out of some screens is to get completely out of them,then go back to where you wanted.<br/>Call quality is good. Camera is good, although a little slow.<br/>The dynamic perspective is a waste, unless you are really into trying to use the phone one handed. I fell it could have used other features.<br/>I have watched a few movies with no issues. The speakers are good. They are sufficient for the phone. If I hadn't thrown away the box accidentally I would be returning it.<br/>I do use Amazon often so having that information at the fingertips is handy.<br/>The battery life is subpar. Does not last long.<br/>Overall 2 starts due to speed and price and application restrictions. It works well for just a phone with email and internet, however don't expect it to support any useful apps.<br/><br/>Update<br/>After using this for several weeks now I am giving it one star.<br/>It is SLOW to load apps, especially music. The phone gets hot when you use it for very long and the battery life is extremely subpar. I wish I could get my money back but alas at least I can earn others.<br/>Save your money buy something else.  It does work well as a paperweight however...
I love this phone!  I was never involved in the Apple or Google networks so this phone was perfect for me.  I've had it now for over a month and had no issues.  I don't understand why so many gave it low ratings.. I've had no problems with the OS and I haven't had any problems with normal phone usage.  Firefly is a handy tool especially if you hear a song on the radio that you don't know anything about or if you aren't sure what the show/movie is called that's playing on the TV.  People love the 3-D effect of the scenes and they also love Monkey Buddy.  The sound is excellent when listening to music and is louder than you'd expect from a cell phone.  Quality and sound on video are also excellent.  Battery life is good and it charges up fairly quickly.<br/><br/>I have a Kindle HDX so I was happy to see that the phone is like a little Kindle.  All my books and content that were on Amazon and in my cloud are on my phone including pictures, video, apps and music.<br/><br/>Overall, I am very happy with the Fire Phone and I'm glad that I ignored all the negative reviews and gave it a chance. :)
Reasons to buy:<br/>1. Amazon customer support: With Amazon as the manufacturer, distributor, and seller, I have zero worries about any gross manufacturing defects.  And that's without mentioning Mayday.<br/>2. The gimmicks: Yes, dynamic perspective and Firefly (and even Mayday) are gimmicks.  But they're still really, really cool.  Just because there aren't many apps that use dynamic perspective yet, doesn't mean it should be discounted.<br/>3. This phone is a complete package: Even without installing any apps, this phone has everything your average person could want, already built in.  I'm not talking bloatware (which is minimal - trust me, there's no NFL app that just can never be deleted), I'm talking about stuff that I'm sure every Samsung user has to go through and download when they get a new phone.  In addition to the basics of talk and text, the Fire OS has E-mail (which CAN connect to Gmail), a web browser, maps, a calculator, a wallet app, weather, a flashlight, a calendar, and all the amazon member apps (books, music, video, shopping).<br/><br/>Reasons not to buy:<br/>1. You're not ready for a change.  If you love your Android or iPhone, then there's no reason to switch.<br/>2. You can't handle not having Grubhub or Seamless apps on the phone (and you can't stand using the browser to just go to the website), or you absolutely love one particular game that is not available on the Amazon app store.<br/><br/>How can I give this phone a 5 star review when it has less than 3 average?  Because it deserves it.<br/>People have dinged it for having poor battery life (it doesn't-- not any worse than any other smartphone ever made), poor app selection (so what?  there's always another app that does the same thing), or being gimmicky (as I already said, the gimmicks are really cool).  Or, they've given this phone a low score because they're still in love with their old phone, and didn't give it a proper chance.<br/><br/>Meh.  Hate the phone if you want.  I kinda like being the only person with a Fire phone-- it's fun showing it off to everyone :D
First off, I love Amazon. I own a Kindle, I buy a lot of things on Amazon, hence why I'm a Prime member (so getting a free year of Prime really sold this to me and the dropped price); however, the Amazon Fire Phone could be considerably better. Considering the competition, iPhone (never owned one, but we know allll about it), Samsung (own one, and never bought another), and all the other phones available on the market, this phone just does not measure up.<br/><br/>This phone freezes A LOT. I have the 64 G (had the 32 as well), and I've had it for roughly 2 week now, and it's freezes. The key board will disappear at times, wont appear till seconds later; after clicking the line to start writing, it will freeze. The lock up screen will stay frozen, and the only way for me to get the phone to unfreeze is to click the power button which there can be a delay. And even then it will freeze on the black screen. Either way, this phone freezes, and that SUCKS. The freezing aspect is my only true complaint. There was an update which not help the freezing, but it did help with the keyboard freezing. Keyboard still freezes and vanishes and all that funky stuff but not nearly as often.<br/><br/>The lack of Apps really isn't a big deal to me. I mainly used "popular" and "big" Apps such as Pinterest, WhatsApp, Instagram, and etc. I do miss SwiftKey (PLEASE, can we get a different keyboard?), AT&T; Messages(this is on AT7T). The battery life use to leave much to be desired, but it has greatly improved after their latest update.<br/><br/>Overall, if you order a lot on Amazon, and are entrench in their "web" this could work. However, bear in mind, this phone freezes. If that would really annoy you, you use Google apps a lot, do not get this phone.<br/><br/>p.s. I've edited my review
There are some issues, and that can be expected with any first generation phone, but I was pleasantly surprised. There are innovative things about the phone that I love.
I like the phone and all the features but have one issue with button on the side. With phone in pocket, button to launch camera is easily depressed and turns camera on.
A good first foray into the highly competitive smartphone market but comes up short.<br/>I'm a huge Amazon fan, having bought from them all the way back in the mid 90s when books were all they sold. I see the thinking that went into this phone from various points of view.  Come up with exclusive features like Fire Fly and Mayday among others, set the market with your core customer base and give an exclusive to one of the major cell phone carriers.  Check all those boxes.<br/><br/>ANY new product launch is fraught with problems and issues.  The Fire Phone is no different.  You can read all the tech information and the early user reviews elsewhere and you should if you're thinking of being loyal to Amazon and get the phone, as I initially did.  However, I'm returning the phone because of the following:  Battery life really sucks.  It gets hot enough to burn your skin after a few hours.  The touted exclusive features work OK but not great.  I can't get Gmail to work on it.  They say it will, but in my case, no way.  I understand the war going on here with Google.  I need my Gmail for business and this won't cut it.<br/><br/>Wrapping up, I'm still a big supporter and fan of Amazon. I have their TV unit which is superb and the HDX which is impressive as well.  The phone?  eh.  I'll wait for the 2d generation to see how many dents they've pounded out from the initial offering.  I do give credit for Amazon having taking on the big boys at Android and Apple in particular.  Good show there.  For now, I'm keeping my Samsung Note 2 until they (Amazon) have figured it out from their sales/customer reviews/results and the attendant remedies they've done before I again consider the APhone2 which I will.<br/><br/>UPDATE: (Feb 11, 2015)  I reordered the Fire Phone to serve as my in-car 2d/backup phone because loyalty has its place and I do love Amazon for many reasons over the past many years, so their service to me which has always been superb has to be realized.  It may sound corny and probably is but that's how I see it.  Besides, the Fire Phone is hardly a sacrifice in this realm because of the stand-alone features it provides above and beyond the Apple/Androids of the marketplace.  Do I still have concerns about the first offering from Amazon on this phone?  Yes, but it feels much better to have it than not, much better to go with what I know about the company and its standards.  Touchy-feely review here on the update?  Probably, but I won't apologize for it.
I absolutely love this phone LOVE OVE LOVE it I have been saving to buy more of them. Now they are stopping sales noooooooo can we have all the fire os secrets now?
I'm so glad that I got the Fire Phone, now that I have used it, I wouldn't want any other phone! I would recommend it to anyone. Thanks AMAZON for a great product.
I love the phone. it is different than any other phone on the market. the only hiccup is the lack of popular apps but it is brand new and that will come in time. works amazing with the kindle fire
It looks to me like Amazon made the same mistake that Microsoft did.  They put resources into developing the basic phone but ignored what makes the iPhone and Android useful beyond what any smartphone can do:  3rd party apps.  Yes, many if not most free/cheap apps are worth fairly little.  I've proved that to myself when I had to hard reset my iPhone and didn't bother reinstalling them.  However, there are half a dozen apps--for banking, network analysis (my job), discussion groups, a pedometer, GPS navigator, sun/moon pointer (for photography), Netflix, IMDB, plus two or three others--that I have come to depend on.  Or at least, I've come to really appreciate the convenience of having them on my phone.<br/><br/>I suspect I'm not unique in my apps availability requirement.  Therefore...no matter how slick the phone, the phone OS, the built in apps, if it doesn't have mainstream support, it's not going to sell.  Look at any magazine ad, TV spot, or other info source, and you'll see "Get our iPhone app" for everything.  For a few less, you'll see Android apps.  And that's about it.  I used to see occasional Blackberry included.  I can't remember the last Windows Phone app I saw.  I've not yet seen a Fire app.<br/><br/>If Amazon wants any chance, they need to do what Microsoft did not do.  Find out the top 500 iPhone apps and pay the developers to offer a Fire version.  Microsoft could have done that with the top 2,000 iPhone apps, and they might have sold some of their overpriced, underpowered tablets and even some phones.  It's all about the apps.  The rest is just window dressing.<br/><br/>And after saying all of that...sorry Amazon, but this just won't do.  It is way overpriced for the hardware you get.  The specs are about what would be considered maybe upper mid-tier these days.  Not flagship. The design is very ho-hum.  Way too bland.  Looks a little like a cross between an iPhone and a Nexus 4 and that's just not a great combination.  The screen looks just okay.  I don't understand why they went with this 3D gimmick.  I believe there were some Android phones that felt the waters on that already a couple of years back and flopped.  I guess they need a gimmick to be different. but I just don't see this motivating many people to switch from Android or Apple.  If Amazon had used the approach that it uses with it's Kindle Fires, sell them at a cheap price in exchange for a deeper integration and access to Amazon service, then maybe.  But $200 on a 2 year contract, $649 and up off contract?  Huh?  No, my HTC One (M7) is a lot sexier than this and it's not even the newest HTC.<br/><br/>I love Amazon. To me, they are the company that can do no wrong. However, this phone misses on every cylinder. They should have delayed the launch by at least a year and gave us something to say "wow" about. Instead, they gave a mediocre phone with some bells and whistles, plus it is ugly! Amazon is way out of their league. Too many companies are tying to be everything.<br/><br/>Who knows?  If Amazon lowers the prices and comes out with a more polished design when I am up for my upgrade next year I'll take a look.  The question is will they still be making phones at that time if this is the likely flop it appears to be?
I love the Amazon For phone..it has great dynamic perspective and I love that the picture quality is so greatly..it does so much and it so sleek and sexy...
I love Amazon and my Kindle(s).  Was so excited to get this phone - it is my first smart phone and I absolutely loved it!  Extremely user friendly, I had no problem with apps, navigation, Wi-Fi and love that all my Amazon and Audible content was synced and ready for me.  I am absolutely heartbroken that I have to return it, but AT&T; just doesn't get service in my area.  No voice or mobile data coverage.  I was very disappointed because they showed excellent coverage on their map and I even visited a nearby AT&T; store prior to this purchase where they assured my the coverage was excellent everywhere I needed it.  This was just not so.  While all the people at AT&T; were very nice I felt they were being dishonest and would have appreciated not wasting so much time, gas and energy on service I was unable to obtain.  Sure hope Amazon will offer the Fire Phone on other networks soon!  Heard from others through this whole fiasco that Verizon is the only service available if you are outside the city limits.
About 2 weeks ago my husband bought me the new Amazon Fire Phone to replace my iPhone.  At first I was a little hesitant as I had tried multiple android devices before and usually gave up after 5 minutes, unable to figure out simple functions or unable to trace apps in the chaos.  In the meantime I just love my Fire Phone and have been recommending to many of my friends and co-workers.<br/><br/>Fire Phone Highlights:<br/><br/>Fire Phone OS 3.5:<br/>To my surprise the Fire Phone's android based OS is awesome: user friendly, intuitive with a clean and refreshed look.  I like the adoption of the carousel technology which allows quick access to your most frequently or most recently used applications with a nice preview on the bottom.  It really makes things (such as email) so much more efficient, effective and accessible.<br/><br/>FireFly:<br/>Music recognition with a click on the button is unsurpassed.  No need for long google sessions retrieving that one song you heard while doing shopping.  1 click of the button tells you in no time the song title, album,...I will use this new feature a lot!<br/><br/>Navigation:<br/>In contrast with a number of reviews, I find navigating very intuitive.  I just went through the 2 minute Fire tutorial and was totally on my way.<br/><br/>Amazon cloud for picture storing:<br/>In contrast with the iCloud I was up and going in 2 minutes with the Amazon cloud.  After 4 years of iphone I still am not able to find my pictures backed up on the iCloud!!  Thanks Amazon for keeping things simple.
I love amazon. I love their products. I love the Kindle. I hate this phone. Limited apps. I can't even get my att app on it anymore. Do not buy this phone. Unless you like phones to freeze on you while you're trying to make a phone call. If you like your phone to take itself off of silent and go to it's highest volume setting then this is the phone for you. If you want limited apps and glitchy software this is the phone for you. Sure, the swipe up to go back feature is nice, and hidden menus make for a clean display, but that's all this phone has going for it. When I call people on the Fire phone they always have trouble hearing me. Screen will become unresponsive and glitchy during normal use. Battery power is horrendous. When I unplug my phone at 7:00AM I have 100% battery life. By 12:30 It's gone down to 43%, or 35% on days when I use the phone a lot. Silk browser is glitchy. When clicking links on say, Facebook, silk browser not only takes forever to load, but also will get stuck on a previous web page and will refuse to load. The camera is ok, but sometimes when you think you've got a good shot, you review it on the camera roll and the picture has gone black. I definitely do not recommend buying this phone.
The fire has some really cool features but is not nearly as user friendly as I would have thought most smartphones would be by now. Just a few of the items that are inconvenient for me as user. No calender app on phone. There is a calendar but you can't use it for anything except looking at dates without some other calendar account (whatever that is?). I used my old one for all my appts and it would send me reminders and such...I can't do that with the Fire,,,very disappointing. Another one is that you can set it send alerts or notifications for apps like FB, but yet nothing shows up, it is literally just the audio alert, but you have no idea for what!  You can't customize the phone either, again not that big a deal for daily use, but still miss the option.  The available apps are limited, which I was aware of and for the most part am fine with because I am not a big app user, but there were a couple that I really miss  like Zedge for getting unique and personal ringtones and notification sounds. Overall, I am sure I will get more used to it and be fine with it, but unlike before, I may be counting down until I can upgrade unless they come up with some upgrades to the Fire between now and then.
Overall this phone is a pretty good phone.  However, if you are expecting an Android you are going to be very disappointed.  I can no longer use ANY of the apps I was using before.  Amazon needs to get with companies like Viggle and Ibota and work on developing an Amazon app.  I am not as impressed with this phone as I wanted to be.  It is basically a Kindle with the ability to make phone calls and text.  If you are an Amazon junkie this phone is for you!  I am not quite an Amazon junkie, but I am headed in that direction with the help of the Fire phone.  :) I am still trying to figure everything out on the phone, such as how to get my music off my computer onto my phone, so I might be back to update this review.  As of right now, I like it, but it wasn't exaclty what I wanted.  I already own a Kindle...I don't need another one.  If there is ever a way to personalize this phone, move my music over to it, and get some ringtones for it then I will like it better.  Maybe there is a way and I just haven't found it yet....anyone have any suggestions?  Oh wait, I guess I can hit the Mayday button and get help.  Another plus to the phone...help is always at the touch of a button. :)
I was a bit worried to move away from iPhone yet have been very satisfied with my new Amazon Fire phone.  It's fun and very functional.  I love it!
Really enjoy the phone
I love this phone. But, there are some issues to it, just like other phones. First of all, the Fire OS isn't the best operating system. I'm not a big fan of the carousel on the phone. The visual dynamics is definitely cool, but as you use the phone, you'll get more used to it. The camera is great, as well as the speakers and the microphone. I love the feature of the non-tangle earphones. Even though you can't see the google play in the app store, it is easily able to be downloaded using this website: http://www.yourbountyhunter.org/firephone/. The phone, itself, looks really nice and feels very comfortable to your hand. There is only one visible button on the screen - the home button. I also love the feature of the flash, which i think is something that every phone should have on it. It has 6 cameras, including the cameras used for the dynamic perspective. I would also recommend get a different case from the amazon case from this phone.
I just LOVE this phone!  I was so hesitant based on so many reviews, but my husband pointed out that many of these reviewers are techno geeks that are probably so invested in Apple and Samsung that I should not use their reviews to make my decision.  I am glad I listened to him (this time!).  This is a great phone and it instantly synced with all my apps, books, music, etc. that I had on my Kindle Fire.
My previous phone was an iPhone 4S.  I purchased this phone from the ATT store on Friday and returned it on Monday.  The phone looks and functions like the tablet.  I really tried to like this phone but too many setbacks so back to the iPhone I go.  I had to pay a $35 restocking fee which I was ok with.<br/>I returned this phone for several reasons.<br/>1) This OS is not supported through my job so I was not able to connect to my work email or calendar.  I store my personal contacts as well as my personal events on my work PC.  So, that’s email, contacts and calendar that I no longer have access to easily.<br/>2) The Amazon app store does not contain two apps that I use with household items (nanny cam, programmable thermostat).  I would no longer be able to control or view these devices using my phone.  That was a really big inconvenience for me.<br/>3) I did not like the email display.  It’s hard to distinguish between read and unread messages.  The only difference is the subject line is bold or unbolded.  It was also difficult to switch between email accounts before figuring it out.<br/>4) I do not like the Internet Browser.<br/>5) The last straw for me was not being able to get my contacts to transfer to this phone.  I tried the transfer app with minor luck.  I then took the phone into the store and was told that I would have to manually key in 130 contacts.  I also was not able to transfer my videos.  I did get my pictures to transfer but they were not in date order.  They were placed randomly into the new phone which kind of bothered me.<br/><br/>This is a nice phone for people<br/>1) that do not need to connect to their work email or calendar<br/>2) do not have specific apps that they need to use that are not available in the Amazon app store<br/>3) do not read email often<br/>4) not familiar with Smart phones.  The Mayday feature is really nice.
UPDATE #2:<br/><br/>I have had this phone since release day. If you read the rest of my review, I had issue with a few items. As of the OS update I received yesterday, most of my issues have been resolved. I am now extremely happy with this phone. It keeps getting better and better. I figure a few more updates to take care of ticky tack things and this will be a near flawless device.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/><br/>After a full weekend of use and orientation with my fire phone, I am very happy with my purchase. I will address some of the issues I have read about in other reviews.<br/><br/>The battery life seems to be improving, as I suspected, with the daily discharge-recharge setting the battery. The issue of the phone getting hot seems to have improved greatly as well. It will still warm up at times, but not nearly as much as when it was fresh out of the box. Again, I am relating this to the battery getting "broken in".<br/><br/>The phone performs as a phone wonderfully. The calls are clear, texts and emails are simple and the keyboard is intuitive and clean. Very easy to operate and navigate.<br/><br/>The Silk browser is clean and simple. For those missing their Google, set your Silk browser to default to Google search. Its an option in the app setting for the browser. You now have your Google!<br/><br/>There were comments about time stamps on emails and texts. Move your head to the side and the phone will show you this info. It is part of the dynamic perspective. You can turn that feature off in the settings and it will always show this info. It seems kinda gimmicky to me, but there is potential for it to be very cool.<br/><br/>The sound from the speakers is clear and accurate. There isnt much low end, but the sound from the 3.5mm port is great. It comes through on my surround sound system in full range. The phone could benefit from an equalizer, but that is more an app complaint than the phone itself.<br/><br/>The camera is fantastic. It opens very quickly, and takes great pictures. They are accurate to color and depth, and the video is great as well. I made a number of clips of my son, who never sits still, and they were all in focus and clear, regardless of how he or I moved about.<br/><br/>The bluetooth works well, as does the WIFI. I had no issues with either connecting or holding a connection.<br/><br/>The maps function is not Google, but it is very good. It is as good, if not better than the Google Maps.<br/><br/>There is no back button. If you took the few minutes to watch the video that launches at the startup of the new phone, you would know this and how to operate the swipe up feature as a back button. It takes some time to get used to it for those (like myself) who were used to a back button, but it is not a negative, just a different feature than I was used to. I have no issue with this now after a few days use.<br/><br/>The few complaints I have are as follows;<br/><br/>The Carousel feature- As I said before, this would be a great feature if it were customizable. I would love to pin about 5 things to this and lock it, using it as a quick access feature to my favorite apps/functions of the phone.<br/><br/>The Apps store lacks greatly behind apple/android, but big deal. I would say that 80% of the apps that MOST people actually use are there. No, I cant play Clash of Clans on this phone (bummer!) but is this really a selling point of the phone? No. That is the app store. The Amazon apps seem to be in more of a beta stage than a final form. To rate the phone lower because of this isnt fair, and I will do a separate write-up for the apps on their review pages.<br/><br/>The tilt/ snap functions are not consistent. I still have trouble getting the phone to realize I am tiliting it, not moving my head. It will dynamically shift, instead of pulling up the side menus. I figure this will be imnproved upon with OS updates.<br/><br/>Overall, I am very happy with this purchase. Read the reviews carefully, as some people are negative rating based upon some very fickle reasoning. For the everyday user, the amazon user and the semi-techy user, this phone is great. For someone who likes to nerd-rage over specs and features and how this phone compares to blah blah blah, you may want to look elsewhere, as you will tear it apart, regardless of how it functions. This is not an Iphone, it is not a Samsung. If you wanted it to be, then why would you buy it. Go get one of those! This phone very capable, it looks clean and functions great. I am convinced that once Amazon gets a couple software updates out, and improves on their app functionality, it will be even better. As always, if anyone has any questions, I am happy to help!<br/><br/>ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br/><br/>Upon opening the package and initial inspection, I love it. It feels good in the hand and the screen is crisp and clear. I charged it up and noticed the body got extremely warm. It stayed hot all through the first day of use, a feature I wasn't expecting. Just because it's a Fire phone doesn't mean it should be hot to the touch. ATT's transfer app would not work to bring over my pictures or contacts, which is incredibly frustrating. There is a very limited number of apps for Amazon, at least any that you want to use. I had to use the Mayday feature to try and understand why the included music app doesn't support Prime music. I had to download a different Prime music app. That makes no sense to me and seems like a huge miss. The sound is clear, although through the speakers I don't hear any noticeable low end in the music.<br/><br/>Today, day two, it isn't nearly as warm, although it still gets warm when used for more than a few minutes. Watching a movie or tv show might make this even worse. I don't know if it is a break in period for the battery or what. I will update this review after a week's use. The auto correct is intuitive, and as far as basic phone functions go, it works great. The camera is very nice and takes great pictures. The auto dim for the screen works well, as does the dynamic perspective, although I am having trouble figuring out when I will actually need it. The side panels on tilt are kind of buggy and don't seem to have a consistent response, as another reviewer mentioned.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint, and I think most would agree, is the lack of customization of the main page. The carousel would be an excellent feature IF you could customize it to have what you want, and LOCK it. As it stands, it puts up ANY and EVERY feature you use on the phone. I don't particularly want to have every stupid thing in my carousel. Currently, it's a clunky and annoying feature that can't be turned off.<br/><br/>It seems like a solid platform, and if Amazon is willing to listen to criticism and update things, it could be great. All said, I would rate it closer to 3.5 stars, with the definite potential for more. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have.
Poor customer service with this Fire Phone from Amazon.  It took at least two hours and many different reps and mayday help to find out that their own Amazon Underground App will **NOT** run on the Amazon Fire Phone.  That app allows for $10,000 of free apps an all in app purchases to be downloaded for free, but it is not compatible with the fire phone.<br/><br/>Additionally I purchased the Fire Phone and I am not able to have the 1 year access to Amazon Prime.  They will not support it nor offer anything to make up for them removing the free 1 year of Prime.<br/><br/>Do not waste your time purchasing this phone for lack of support and false advertising.  The Fire Phones have been disontinued do to lack luster sales.  I purchased this thinking I would benefit from the 1 year of free prime and the free Underground App.  NOT able to.<br/><br/>Additionally, you do NOT have access to the google play store on this Fire Phone.
This is an awful phone, there are hardly any apps for it, they changed the price to 99 cents and I am paying way too much for a crappy phone.  Battery life sucks, I can't make a call and hear unless I have the speaker on and then it is so crackly you can't hear.  I have to use this phone exclusively in my car with the bluetooth setting or it is useless.  The camera is good, that is why it has one star, but... I have been on the phone  1.5 hours with an AT&T; person and 1 hour with an Amazon person, and you can't just download your photos, I had to payn 1.99 for an app to try and get them downloaded to my computer, but that app didn't work with windows 10, so then had to get chrome, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH - has just been a f'n disaster.  I will say the Amazon lady in customer service was good, but I have already spent tooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much time on the phone trying to deal with this.
I've had this phone for a few days now... and I really really love it. It has a very simple user interface. The carousel and the quick actions are a breeze to use. Also, the camera on this phone rocks. Here are some of the pros and cons, that I feel are for this phone.<br/><br/>PROS<br/>++ User Interface: When you pick an app in the carousel you see quick actions that can be performed before opening the app. For instance, Mail lets me see new mails without opening the app. Phone lets me quickly call the recent contacts. I think you get it by now.<br/>+ Amazon Apps & Prime: If you're an Amazon Prime user, it can't get better than this. The support for the Amazon ecosystem is amazing. + Firefly: I would love to see other apps make use of the firefly. For instance, Netflix and Hulu for movies, Walmart, Target and other retailers for groceries and etc.<br/>+ Dynamic Perspective: This one may sound gimmicky, but I think this has potential especially with games.<br/>+ Mayday: I feel this truly separates this phone from every other phone in the market. It's like having someone available 24x7 to help you out with your phone. You are connected to an expert within 10-15 seconds and, there is no charge for that "ever".<br/><br/>CONS<br/>- Dynamic Perspective: I know I've listed this item in the PROS. Here is what I don't like about this. "if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail". I hope the use of this technology is limited to where it is relevant.<br/><br/>Overall, I love this phone. I used to be an avid IOS user. I have tried Android and Windows phone before and have felt that no one gets the customer like Apple does. Now I feel that no one gets the customer like Amazon does.
Not what I expected. The glass is already scratched after two months. The functions are glitchy, nothing runs smoothly. The phone also randomley reboots itself, and shuts off. I should have stayed with the iphone.
Love the free prime account for a year that comes with the phone.  I logged on to Prime Video, found Anchorman 2 and then instantly enjoyed my new account. Nice camera, nice battery life, and good size for a phone.  We use this as an office phone instead of having a landline and to take mobile credit card payments at craft shows and such.  The operating system is different, but it is pretty easy for everyone to learn with the preloaded demo.  Our last office phone was an Android (in an office of Iphone users) and people really couldn't understand that in the beginning because there wasn't a nice demo app.<br/><br/>I like the Fire phone because it is different. It is an experiment and I think they did a pretty decent job. It's a pretty interesting gadget too with things like the Firefly, which we used on a road trip to identify songs coming from our ancient car stereo. All around a good value for our business.
I have only found one thing I do not like about this phone. The lack of apps. Since I knew this before I purchased. It get 5 for sure stars.
It is almost everything that I thought it would be. It has a few glitches and such, but overall, I'm extremely pleased with the performance.
I enjoy the sis and the set up but an having trouble when I'm in an app and in large a pic you can't back out without restarting the phone.
So far I like most everything about this phone. The camera is great and it seems to be the quality product that I would expect from amazon.
I really like the fire phone. It's a great device, no issues with its functionality.<br/>You will find the apps limited. The Amazon app store has most of the big apps, Facebook etc, but you'll find a lot of the smaller developers aren't on the marketplace yet. This is something Amazon tells you up front. Just be aware that you can not use the Google play store like you would most Android phones. If you're like me and don't use a ton of apps, you'll be plenty happy with what's available.<br/>Dynamic perspective is a cool addition. Not absolutely necessary but neat non the less<br/>The gesturing and moving the handset to access menus takes a little getting used to, but is useful once you get accustomed.<br/>Battery life could be better, but a full charge gets me through a full day with average usage without a problem.<br/>All in all a great phone. Switches from and iPhone and have not regretted it.
I plan on getting the phone now that its .99.  I have read all the awful reviews, but I believe this phone is for us Amazonians and not just a regular smart phone user.  Those of us who have Prime accounts on our PC's or Kindle Fire's are those who will understand and take advantage of this type of opportunity.
Great phone. Love it!
I'm very happy with the phone, but disappointed that Amazon cut the price shortly after I bought it from $199 to $.99.  The fact that they cut the price so quickly raises red flags about the longevity of this device.  I was considering a Nokia 1520 but it's price was a steady $199 for over a year so I decided to go with the Fire Phone.  I love the Prime integration and I was able to import almost my entire music collection without digital rights issues (about 4,000 songs).  Battery life is comparable to other phones I've had.  The quad core processor is very fast.  It boots up quickly and it's only locked up once on me.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Fast Processor<br/>- Prime integration<br/>- Excellent Customer support<br/>- Excellent display<br/>- Mine has been very stable<br/>- I was able to synchronize with both Outlook and Facebook contacts<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Quick price drop from $199 to $.99 was disappointing and disconcerting<br/>- Not all Android apps are in the App Store (actually, you can install any Android app)<br/>- Keyboard lacks emojis/emoticons
There are many reasons to like this phone! Let's start with the look and feel. Perfect size- not too big as I find most handsets these days. Heavy enough to feel like a premium phone, but not too heavy. The general look of the phone is simple, yet elegant, with gorilla glass on front and back. The rubber around the sides offers good grip.<br/>  As far as performance, I find the phone to be fast, responsive and fun. The OS is similar to android, but different enough to be fresh and entertaining.<br/>  The screen is clear with nice color. The dynamic perspective is gimmicky, but I don't find it annoying.<br/> Battery life seems good and better than most of my other phones. Good for the whole day unless I am playing alot of games.<br/> I personally find the phone to be fun and interesting. May take a couple of days to get used to, but definitely worth it.<br/>  Get one!
I have been subjected to the lack luster of the Samsung Galaxy 2. Imagine my surprise when I got my hands on the FIRE! It is awesome.
It's a great phone. I am used to Android phones. It's very different from one of those. I've had it for about a week and a half now and still am getting used to it. You have to have an amazon account just to sign in the phone at the beginning when your setting everything up. A lot of things on the app store are free but a lot of things like zedge ringtones free mp3 music and things like that you can download for free on an android phone don't even show up in the app store on this phone. Which really sucks because the ringtones that come on the phone are very soft and I have already been late to work twice because I need a loud alarm to wake me up in the morning. This phone was a present for me. I do like it but I do not love it. But so far I haven't had any issues with it and it's pretty durable seeing as I've dropped it at least three or four times now.
The phone is ok descent storage space however the phone has froze on me a few times does not have a lot of normal android apps and can be really poor at times on the reception. With that being said the battery can be very long lasting and you do get a year of prime that's a huge plus even if I was to pay for prime it would have already paid for itself on how much I have ordered odds are I will be remaining with prime when my year is up however as soon as my galaxy s4 gets back to me I will be changing back to that phone it's the little things like on maps it shows me street view and the house I should be looking for I am a delivery driver and a lot of the houses in my town just do not have the physical address on them, there are way more apps on the galaxy the only reason this phone received 4 stars from me is prime and I also only paid 1$ for the phone.
I don't write reviews.  But i have to say for my 1st week with this phone---AWESOME.  So far the only thing that it doesn't do for me is drive my car.  Now i know what they mean by SMART phone.
I really had hopes for this phone. I'm not picky when it comes to apps. I'll do with what's available. I got along fine with my cheap LG phones, even though the photos weren't as beautiful as the iPhones and the audio was not so great. I had hopes for Mayday. I thought that would alleviate all my problems, if I had any. Well, it hasn't. The Fire Phone is the only phone I've ever had that my iMac will not recognize connected by bluetooth or by cable. I can't import photos from my Fire Phone using iPhoto. I have to download the photos from the phone using an Android file transfer app or from Amazon Cloud. I was on line with Mayday for an hour. The guys just said, the phone simply isn't compatible with Macs. This is not OK with me. I guess this review is pointless, but now I really see why the Fire Phone is discontinued. I'm glad I didn't pay full price!
Love the phone.  Easy to use and great features. But I really wish Amazon would figure out how to make a smart watch work with it.
Awesome 3-D graphics. It takes a little get used to, as this has technology that shifts with hoe you point and look at the phone.
I've had it for 13 months. In general, I've been a satisfied customer. It lacks some Apps I enjoy (NY Times, The Atlantic, some easier to use Google features) but everyone knows that. But other things have worked very well. As a phone and for messaging it's been great, the battery is good and I've set it up as a hot spot numerous times without issue. I love the fact that I can now download selected Prime shows and films and watch offline. Which I just did on a couple of XC flights.But now that it is out of warranty by a month I learn I can get no support for my cracked screen --- just happened. It looks like I'd have to pay $150 to have the touch screen replaced. Ouch. And since Amazon no longer sells these I'm guessing I'm just simply S-O-L and need to find another phone.But if anyone out there has another solution I'm all ears. Thanks.
this phone has some pretty great audio, which is a big deal for me cause I use music as an alarm clock and waking up to good sound is a definite plus. The camera really is great and makes every picture look like you tried 20 times and picked the best one, so that saves a lot of time for social media. The dynamic view whatever is pretty innovative and cool too, i hope they find a way to implement this into video games and 3d movies and other 3d games too making it one step closer to virtual reality. I do think you should buy a case for this phone but as with anything beautiful and glass it is always good to protect it. A free year with amazon prime is awesome cause i love it and will probably get a new phone in a year anyways. The firefly thing is cool but not for phone numbers cause thats easy enough to just type in yourself but the fact it saves it with contact info does save you some time which is always good cause the less time you have to point your phone at things in public the better i think anyways.
I love it, I have the unlocked version. No complaints, seems this phone is way underrated but it is actually a very good phone.
Love it. Love the firefly technology; it can tell you the scene on a movie or show and even the actor's in the scene. Amazing.
I don't care what the other people are saying this is a great phone! Don't be led astray by all the naysayer's, get one today!
I bought this phone about a week ago, and I'm enjoying it more the more I play with it.  A lot of the things people are complaining about are honestly small things that you could get used to if you wanted to, like the menu navigation.  This is only my second smart phone, and I'm not sure I'd say it's better than my old phone (which was a Motorola Droid Razr M), but I'm definitely not returning it.  Though, to be fair, I got it for free with a service contract, so even if I hated it, it wasn't really a waste of money...<br/><br/>The hardware's great; the screen is a good size and great resolution, its processor is as powerful as my laptop's for some reason (why does a phone need this, I don't know), and the outward-facing camera's got good resolution.  However, the hardware does drain the battery when you're actually using it.  I don't really use my phone for much besides talking and playing music, though.<br/><br/>Not having access to the Google app store is a huge downside and a very legitimate complaint; hopefully this changes at some point.  I would be fine buying my apps through Amazon if they had the same selection, but they simply don't.  At least it's an Android, so you can easily install whatever apps you want on it, provided you can find a way to get their installation packages...<br/><br/>And now for some petty stuff:  As an upside, I'm a sucker for gimmicky technology so the face-tracking camera thing is cool even though I'm sure that's part of why the phone would've cost so much without a data plan.  As a downside, I don't think I can smother the speaker on this phone with my hand if it starts making noise in a public place or something.  Maybe I just haven't found the right spot yet.<br/><br/>Overall the phone seems solid, though I didn't factor in some things other people would consider, such as the price and interface (You'll learn to use the interface if you don't stubbornly/cynically refuse not to).  If it had the Google store, I'd give it five stars, but even as someone who doesn't really purchase apps I feel like that's rather important.
Call quality is excellent. It has a great camera that backs up photos to the cloud, and now with the OneDrive app also backs up to my Live account. The Fire phone offers a superior user experience while getting into and out of books, movies, TV, magazines, games etc...especially Amazon media. Because it is dedicated it takes fewer clicks to get to a movie streaming real HD glitch-free. Other devices can stream that movie but it takes a little longer to get into it, the quality is less stable, and the app is more buggy. The Fire phone synchronizes effortlessly with your other Kindle devices so you can instantly pick up where you left off. There is a learning curve getting used to how it addresses conveniences using new technology it offers like "Peak" for information by tilting the phone a little and side menus with a twist of the wrist but after using it for awhile it makes more sense than other phones. It is less buggy than most Android phones. I can easily see how this would not be for you if you did not like Amazon but...are you crazy?. In the same way that the Nexus 5 is dedicated to Google, this is for Amazon. I don't need much else beyond email, text, web browsing, news, pictures and Amazon services. The store has most of the apps I wanted with a few notable exceptions that are coming out soon. I like the feel of it. The screen is crystal clear. It streams media with very high resolution. The battery lasts long enough for me to only charge it once a day, which is not as good as an IPhone but better then the Android based HTC Evo I had. I guess I am one of the people who will not be returning it, probably because I like a dedicated Amazon device like my Kindle Fire Tablets. They go well together. A marriage made in heaven. I hear complaints that it doesn't do as much as an Android phone. A Porsche doesn't do as much as an SUV either, but if you want to go very fast around corner's and you are willing to pay for it... I don't own an SUV.
I just purchased this phone yesterday, and without having it a full 24 hours, I've already pretty much figured out how everything works. Before buying this phone, I was was strictly and iPhone user. I got an iPhone 4S back in 2010, and I've never felt the urge to get on the bandwagon of upgrading to the latest phone, simply because I don't really see any real differences that would make me want an iPhone 5. I've ignored most of the iOS upgrades, because they were more annoying to me than anything and never really offered anything new.<br/><br/>I've been in the market for a new phone for a while, because although iPhone has suited me well, and does all I need it to do, it's a bit lacking when it came to screen size and sound quality. I was considering getting a Samsung Galaxy S5, but when I found out Amazon was coming out with this Fire phone, I decided to look into it. To be honest, I wasn't severly dependent on the iPhone's ecosystem, so I felt no real loss there. I'll admit that it is annoying that I can't transfer my songs and playlists to this phone, but it's not a deal killer.<br/><br/>For those complaining about it not having Google Play, don't you think that would be one of the first things you ask about or look into before you purchase it? Again, I don't rely on a phone's ecosystem to get me through the day, so if you don't either, then this is the perfect phone for you. It's simple and easy to use once you go through the tutorial, you get a free year of Amazon Prime, which can be used to stream thousands of songs and playlists for free, and I just discovered today that you will get a one month free subscription to Beats Music, which I love, because I'm all about music streaming. I also love the two speakers it has, at both the top and bottom of the phone; they really enhance the quality of the sound.<br/><br/>I think if you take the phone for what it is upfront, you won't be disappointed. I don't have any regret switching over to Fire Phone. Like many others have said, this is the first version and there are still kinks that need to be worked out, but it all comes with time.
Update 9/9/14 My keyboard went missing today while trying to browse the web. I switched over to messaging and it still was not showing up. I turned the phone off and on a few times to see if that would clear it and then it would not turn back on. After 15 minutes or so, it finally turned back on but the battery lost 20% I took it to AT&T; service center and they made me do a factory reset. So far it is working, but it's still a bit quirky. Factory resetting this is not a great fix Amazon. ATT said that it is probably a software glitch, but cannot confirm it since the device was working ok when I was at the center.<br/><br/>I am not in love with this phone and regret wasting my money (I paid full price). Seeing Amazon giving it away within 2 months of release is a slap in this customers face. If this is how Amazon is trying to make money, then they will lose me pretty much as a customer. I still love my kindle, but this phone is not a winner.<br/><br/>99 cent phones don't receive a lot of updates unless Amazon is willing to roll out a better phone/operating system in the near future. I'm now stuck using this phone for the next 2 years because of the 2 year commitment with ATT.<br/><br/>Moms can buy this phone for their kids - like the commercial because this adult is frustrated with it. It would probably make a good toy.<br/><br/>Amazon would do themselves right by giving their customers that preordered this phone and/or paid AT&T; the full price some sort of credit or at least give us a few years of Prime for our suffering with this thing.<br/><br/>==============================================<br/><br/>Update - I received an unexpected email from Amazon support today referencing my review. They are definitely reading these reviews. It wasn't much help as I already have done the steps they suggested for battery life. (Turn off blue tooth, use auto for the screen light, watch the heavy usage on videos and such.)<br/><br/>After having the phone for a few days, the battery life is better. Today, I have made zero calls and no downloading or watching videos. I've only checked my email and the weather a few times and the battery has lasted all day. I'm not a big voice user, so I haven't a clue how the talk time wears down this battery. This is much better than the first day when I had it in my pocket all day and it died within 6 hours. I'm glad I didn't need to make a call.<br/><br/>I am pleased that Amazon is taking the time to read our reviews. I am hoping that they have their IT folks working away at our issues. I don't want to be stuck with a phone that I can barely use. The phone is growing on me, but it still bugs me about the lack of apps/no google play, and the battery life still scares me. Hey Amazon - think about your loved ones with a dead battery trying to reach you in an emergency. I'm not always near a power supply to keep this thing charged!<br/><br/>===============<br/>I am a fan of Amazon. I have a kindle paperwhite that I dearly love and have had zero problems with it. I figured I'd take the plunge and try the new fire phone as my Iphone battery life was disappointing. When I read the specs on Amazon phone touting lots of standby time, I was eager to try it. The battery on this phone is worse than my Iphone! I'm not running a lot of apps, turned off what I could to see if that would help with the battery life. Nope, still a battery pig.<br/><br/>I was sad to see that I could not download anything from google play. The apps store is lacking on a few of my favorite apps, including the local TV station's app. The sounds of the phone are not loud enough for me to hear when I'm in a different room or around loud machinery. I wish I could make the icons larger, now I have to have my reading glasses handy when using the phone.<br/><br/>The phone does have a lot of cool features. I am an Amazonaholic, so I like a lot of the phone features linked up with my Amazon account. That part I really like and thank Amazon for that.<br/><br/>I don't usually buy brand new technology. I should have stayed with that philosophy and let Amazon get the kinks out before I bought the phone. Now I have to carry my charger everywhere with me. You can add the fire phone to the Samsung commercial with everyone sitting on the floor charging their phones at the airport. Now I will have to buy a solar charger when I go camping.<br/><br/>I hope Amazon is reading these reviews and gets back to the drawing board for some quick fixes.
I had an Iphone 4 and loved it until IOS 7.1.2 came out. My phone become very glitchy so I decided to get the Fire. I love this phone! Although its completely different from apple its very slick looking and very fast. Graphic wise I think its great. The 3D is a cool feature. The camera takes great pictures and videos but it can be kinda slow at times. I love how there is a speaker on both ends of the phone and the sound comes out very nicely especially when its turn on its side while watching videos and movies. The browser is amazingly fast (beats chrome by far) and I wish I could put it on my desktop and laptop. One major issue about this phone is how you can't use Google store. The phone can be very confusing at times. I think Amazon needs to work on  the OS for this phone. Other than that I like it a lot. I was able to get mine for .99 thru AT&T; and getting a year worth of prime for free is great!! Especially for someone who works the front desk of a hotel.
Still works great after more that a year and turned out to be a good value over time as it is a veritable tank of a phone!
Great phone that works quickly and efficiently. Camera takes much better pics than my iphone. If you love amazon there are lots of amazon-rlated apps like kindle and music. Biggest con: hopefully amazon will develop a better system for a "back button" than swiping or flicking the wrist. They just don't always work and I can't count how many times I have been stuck, like in Facebook messages and unable to get back to news feed - though eventually swiping works. Also would be nice to have a better app for finding the phone that is friendly with iphone.  The year of Prime is worth a lot for a frequent amazon shopper. In the end, I mostly purchased it for the amazon name. It's worth it, but just bear in mind it may take some getting used to and will probably evolve and improve over time.
I am in love with my Amazon Fire Phone, i love this phone more then i liked my other cell phones i have had in the past
I really enjoy this phone way better than the iPhone the only thing I don't like is the App Store is seriously lacking
This phone is amazing! It does everything I need and so much more. And it's in sync with my kindle fire which I love!
Great phone. Easy to use. It has a huge variety of apps to use. Great price. Good size. Nice design. Nice quality.
I love this phone, so far! I finally got to were I hated my iphone, went to an LG that was OK, but I love this!!!!
better than apple
The specs were sub par to begin with... then came the dual software. Fire OS 4 is just a stripped down version of kit kat with Amazon software running over top of it. If you want any actual usage out of it you have to re-download all the things amazon removed. This causes the battery to drain faster and the phone to run slower, forcing you to turn off the the single almost redeeming factor to attempt to gain more battery life; the precious 3D effects. Then comes Alexa, sounds great right...wrong, the fire phone never got Alexa and is stuck with the equivalent of iOS's original voice control. Maybe with Fire OS 5 it'll be better, sure maybe but the fire phone stopped receiving updates shortly after it came out, and is virtually unsupported.
Completely disappointed, the app store is horrible.  No big ticket apps make their way to the Amazon app store.
This is thee 4th phone and very disappointed with them phone dose not hold a charge and blu tooth dose not work on both phones which I also had the same problem with the first one the Bluetooth worked for about three months then it stopped working period and I have a few different types of speakers to use and dose not work with any of them one being a bose speaker which worked fine up to a few months then stopped also lost all pictures and video that I had in the first phone that was replaced because all it did was keep rebooting till the battery did so I'd like to know how this issue with this's bad phones can be resolved or should I just get new type of phones and also cancel my att service which is what iam leaning towards.
I do lots of business with Amazon.  A substantial part of that buisiness is books.  The Fire Phone fits my needs perfectly.  I read any book I want, I order anything I want (anywhere on the web) and I search the web for anything I want.  (Do you see a pattern?)<br/><br/>Sure there are a few bugs and some app availability issues, but nothing is perfect, especially when a new and great product is rolled out.  That's why I give it 4 stars instead of 5.  I am confident that it will be a 5 star machine by January. (PLUS the price is right.)<br/><br/>I own two 64GB Fire Phones (plus a Fire Tablet, Paperwhite and Kindle Software for my laptop) and my wife and I are thrilled with them.  I would recommend these Fire Phones to anyone, especially to an ardent Amazon customer.<br/><br/>p.s.  There are no securiy issues, they don't bend, calendar synchronization works perfectly, MayDay is great, one year free Prime for each phone and the 3D screen wows the heck out of everybody that sees it.  Hang in there Bezos, stay the course.
I've had the Fire 2 1/2 weeks. It has been like/dislike on and off. The phone has a good sound and is pretty easy to navigate.  It also takes great pictures.  Mayday has been helpful but they too are learning this new phone. The folks at Mayday do know alot more than the instore sales reps.  I was very disappointed that the phone does not work with my Nexus 7 contrary to what the sales reps said. (My old Android phone was completely compatible with the Nexus.) Therefore, I'm having to change over to Kindle/Amazon completely as nothing from Playstore or Playbooks transfers over. That said, I am slowly finding apps to replace the Android apps I liked and used and the Fire apps seem to be better. I am not a "techy" person at all so this has been quite a stretch for me. I think in the long run I will like the phone. However, I do hope they will continue to work on new apps and updates  I will continue to call Mayday as they are learning the phone much faster than I am and they are very patient with slow learners!.
I love the Amazon Fire phone. I went from the iPhone 4 to the fire. It does take a little time to get use to navigating through the phones functions. But the phone does come with an assistance video and the maday button. Which if anyone that has used Amazon's customer service it is the same, fast, friendly, a live person ( which is rare now a days). Apps download very fast and you can see how much each function is using in memory and battery life. It will take a few times to get use to tilting the phone to get to other functions but once you get the hang of it you will be good to go. The 3D screen savers are hot, at first they are set to change daily which I thought was cool. I would say get it you won't be disappointed.
love the high tech features of the phone, dislike not all android apps are availible or compatable with phone
The phone is amazing, I love the help option, Prime, the apps, the way the phone operates.  Its just amazing.
If you are a fan of using Amazon prime this phone is great. If you aren't part of the cult of prime walk on.
I really like the fire phone, even though I was very nervous about getting it because all the reviews are very negative. But it has surpassed my expectations, it's fast, has a great camera, and I absolutely love the dynamic perspective giving the phone a 3D look just amazing! There are only a couple of things I don't like but have gotten over, the battery could be better I find myself charging more often than I use to. No big deal I bought a car charger. The other thing is the carousel isn't very private, as you swipe through recently used apps every thing is shown from last calls to text messages and emails. Both not a huge problem for me. Overall I love the look and build of the phone. I say good job Amazon!
The most awesome phone I have ever owned. I am still learning all that it can do.  For me, it seems easier to operate than my husband's Apple iPhone.
My son loves it!
I have been needing a new phone for several months ( I had a Motorola  Atrix). I could not decide between the Samsung Galaxy5 or the Amazon Fire. The reviews we very mixed on the Fire so I was leaning towards the Samsung. I have a kindle fire and love it but just wasn't sure. Well, then the Fire went on sale for $.99. That is what sold me on it. I really like the Fire, it fits well in my hand, nice design and fairly simple to figure out. The one major problem I have is trying to turn the camera off once it is on. The camera button is on the left side and I am left handed so I tend to push it often by mistake. I now take care to not push it. The phone itself is clear sounding, good reception. The camera takes great pictures. Grant it you don't have google play but owning a Kindle Fire has made it easier for me to know the apps.
We had one for me, then loved it so much got another for husband. Now we purchased a third for our son.  We love the camera, especially that it can take the photos 3 at a time where we can get one right before and right after the photo that shows up.  That helps fix the whole "blink" or "look away" problem. We added the Vire Launcher, Play Store, and other features to it to make it more like a regular android. It was easy to do. I can't remember how to turn it back to regular Fire OS, but think I would now be willing to try.  I love how, unlike Apple products, I never have to worry about a cracked screen.  It's ridiculous how often those apple people have to get new screens or phones.
I already had a Kindle Fire DX before I got the phone and love the OS on it.  When it came time to get a phone, I thought it would be just as easy to use.  It doesn't have a lot of frivolous gadgets cluttering up the home screen like other phones. Which is nice.<br/><br/>The battery doesn't last as long as the battery on the tablet does when you are using the apps. Although it is nice that it takes less than an hour for the phone to fully recharge.  I was pretty disappointed when I received an e-mail from nextissue.com saying that Amazon will no longer support their app. The only other thing I was disappointed with was that it does not pick up my WiFi at home when I don't broadcast the ssid.
Amazing phone I've got in trouble many times for being obsessed with it every thing about it is amazing.
I really like the Amazon Fire Phone, it is everything I expected it would be. Amazon never disappoints!
My wife loves it. It added a bit to our AT&T; monthly bill for data use but it's worth it. I just wish this could run the Opera Android browser. One star off for limited browser availability; the default "Silk" browser isn't all that great. But it has plenty of just about every other kind of software we'd want to use with a telephone, it's easy to operate, and it hangs onto cell towers during travel a lot better than the flip phone he had before. Also, the pleather cover we ordered with it is well designed and quite protective. I read in Time Magazine that the Fire phone is too expensive. Since we paid under a dollar, all I can say to that is: Yeah, right. Uh huh.
I love the Kindles and the firestick.  I was so excited to get this phone.  My first Fire Phone had many problems, Amazon quickly sent me a replacement.  I love how Amazon always stands behind their product.  BUT the new phone has a few problems as well.  When I have a new text message, if there is a previous conversation that had 10 threads, the phone tells me I have 11 new messages.  Also, the bluetooth doesn't work well with my subaru.  A conversation will flip between the phone and the car.  The screen is crisp and colors are vibrant.  I am keeping the phone, because the benefits (amazon prime) far outway the con's.  Keep working on it Amazon, it will be great soon.
The quality of the hardware is nice.  But the software is buggy and the apps are limited.  However, I read that Amazon is quitting on the Fire Phone so I want to leave a message to the company.  I think Amazon should consider a different strategy with the Fire rather than than quitting.  They should redesign the phone to run the Android system then migrate the users to Android.  Then focus on developing the Apps under the Android system.  This idea would solve the two main problem with the phone - a lack of an ecosystem and an uncompetitive operating system.  It would instantly breath new life into the phone.  And I think it would be a better solution than giving up.
I really like this phone...it has amazing graphics and it is fast when it comes to web browsing too.
I have cycled back and forth several times between my galaxy 4 and my fire phone.  I am using the fire phone for 6 or so months now, on i-wireless T-Mobile carrier.  It was easy to love at first,  shopping on Amazon gets  Fire phone cudos.  Little frustrating things like an Amazon advert button on the bottom of the Calculator App, make it so stupidly frustrating.  I try. To use the Calculator and the stupid shopping button keeps diverting me to another Amazon purchase window.  I was working on a ledger this morning, wondering what idiot thought making the shopping button on the Calculator, obscuring part of the bottom calculator line would sell anything.
So far - I am giving this phone a 5 - I really do like it a lot. It is so much easier to use than my Galaxy 3 S mini. It came with most of the apps I use regularly and it wasn't hard to find and download any others. I like the size - I used the MayDay button yestrday and got immediate response - and Firefly!!! OMG LOVE it!!! I had issues registering the phones (I got 2 - one for me and one for my daughter) but the AT&T; website was having issues yesterday. I was able to get everything set up this morning. One concern I have though is I don't see where it is possible to change the battery so ...if the battery wears out, then what?  My daughter was concerned that I wouldn't like it or would find it difficult to use but so far - it is so easy!  Happy at this point!!!
overall very pleased with the form, size and functionality... I loved that when i turned it on it already had my amazon accounts of Audible with all my books there as well as in my kindle app all the purchases were there. I was very pleased with how easy it was to transfer my music from iTunes to the Amazon Music. The keyboard is very responsive and easy to type correctly on! much better than the Samsung Galaxy or the iPhone. there are just a couple of things that could be better. the voice recognition is not nearly as good as on the Galaxy S5  and the way it deletes messages in your mailbox is not nearly as fluid a the Galaxy but at the same time better then the iPhone. overall it is a great phone and my current favorite out of the iPhone5S and the Galaxy S5.
If your a fan of the kindle fire like myself you will love the fire phone. I think the firefly app is really awesome, especially when I'm listening to music and want to find out the song title and singer. So far it's really durable. (I've dropped it twice and there were no cracks) It's very easy to navigate especially if your already familiar with the kindle fire. I have read some reviews about there being no back button but all you have to do to go back is to simply swipe up on the screen and it goes to the previous page. All the apps I have downloaded work great. (Actually better than they do on my kindle fire) With all that being said I love it.
It was what I wanted if you enjoy your kindle fire this is the good phone and the free prime rocks
For the price, this is a great phone. Yes it doesn't offer ALL the apps which is sometimes a drag (accessing through websites instead), but it is $100 (right?). I have had it since January and it is still doing just fine for the most part. We have two fire phones in our family now and they are both great. Too bad Amazon took this phone down...Why not just improve the features?<br/><br/>As for selling this product at $600 as originally listed, I think that's complete insanity. With the offer of more apps and by working with Google, they could have made this phone easily sell for $450.<br/><br/>Have used Android and Apple phones previously.
A prety decent phone. Wirks fine and has good specs. Still need to improve on the apps available.
I really love this phone, still trying to figure it out. Love the Amazon prime free for one year.
Best  phone ever. I love everything about the fire phone. I have  owned several kinds of cell phones going back to the early 1990's with a bag phone.  The fire phone lets me do everything I want to do. Check emails, text messages and the best feature is the taking and receiving pictures. Picture taking is my hobby and I own several expensive cameras. The fire phone camera takes pictures just like those expensive cameras and now I do not have to carry all the extra heavy equipment. I love my fire phone and I am so happy I choose this phone and will be back when I need to purchase a new phone. Thank Amazon for a great product but nothing new there, I love everything about Amazon and it is my go to place to purchase anything from soup to nuts!
I like the platform and features of this phone.  I've been debating on getting it, but when the price dropped I had to jump.  I've been a Kindle fan for years.  I like my previous apps load to my phone automatically.  THe camera is awesome.  Though I don't have much use for it the Firefly feature is my new fun gadget. What needs improvement more than anything else is the battery life.  If you use your phone a lot, like I do you will be constantly charging your battery.  I just take the usb cord with me and charge it in the car, charge it on the laptop...CHARGE it constantly.  I was also disappointed it doesn't work with my Ford Sync.  They have some work to do but for their first entry in the competitive cell market I think they did o.k.
I do not like the phone because I can only download limited apps. Can't download my needed apps
It's very easy to use. UI is intuitive.<br/>Battery is moderate, not as bad as described in some of reviews.
I've had this phone now for two months and overall it's worked well and met my needs.  Given the $.99 price point and the year of Prime, I think the phone is a great value.  With regard to the available apps, I've not run into any major problems...though my main uses are for calls & texts, playing music and listening to audio books, checking the weather and light web use.  My only frustration was an inability to load music via USB...I ended up paying for the Amazon Music cloud service which I hadn't intended but overall have been happy that I did.<br/><br/>Overall, I think the product is reliable and a great value.
Easy to use. Great new features. Nice weight. Exactly what I was looking for in a new phone.
I love amazon, so I wanted to love my Fire Phone. I bought it the day it came out through AT&T; next program. Now I am sorry that I am stuck with it for another year. I previously had the Galaxy Note 1, and it was fantastic. I am sorry that I betrayed the droid. The lock screen is beautiful. I love them, but I am stuck with a phone that all I can do is e-mail and facebook.  I cannot get the aps that I used on my previous phone because they are not available. No Target Cartwheel, No mobile banking, and that is just to start the list.  I'm sorry Amazon, but this is crap. People have trouble hearing you unless you hold the phone in a certain position.<br/><br/>If you are smart, you will not buy this phone!!!
It's ok. Not worth the money I am paying for it. I will probably go back to iPhone one day.
I switched to this phone from an iPhone 3gs. I know it was out dated. I've never a smartphone other than the iPhone. I absolutely love the fire phone! I was very hesitant to get this phone after reading some reviews out here, but this was the phone I kept coming back to. My hubby finally told me to just get it already! Lol some of the complaints I have read could easily be solved by visiting an att store and getting a tutorial on how to use the phone. I bought in store, instead of onaAmazon, and our att rep was excellent! He showed how to use the phone. I've read several complaints that you cannot go back to your news feed after you click on a photo in Facebook... yes, you can. You swipe up from thebbottom to the top of the phone. I've also read that there is not a Google app... yes, there is. It's right there in the app store plain as day. The dynamic perspective is very cool! I have yet to use firefly. I love this phone. If you have one or decide to get one, either follow the tutorials or go into a store and actually learn how to use the phone before placing a review.
The phone itself is ok but just barely so, nothing spectacular. Works ok, has decent battery life. My complaints are more to do with Amazon choices than the phone itself. First, by offering it ONLY thru AT&T;, there is a limit on the internet. Only Sprint offers unlimited internet. Second, Google PlayStore is not available so all the apps must be downloaded from the internet or from Amazon. Amazon does offer some free or low cost apps but there are many exclusively available thru Google PlayStore and cannot be downloaded. I can't get Geico Insurance app, MySMS.com, and so many others I depended on. Overall it's ok but nothing new or exciting. I definitely wouldnt get it again!
I have had my phone for 24 hours, and I LOVE it already!! I had an Iphone and was ready for something that work better for me in several areas, including pictures. I am an Amazon person, so I knew I needed to check this phone out. It feels very comfortable using it. Going from an Iphone to the Fire phone is a super easy transition. Navigation on the phone is very similar to what I am used to. And the shortcuts with the flick of a wrist are awesome!! There are a couple apps I have found aren't available, but I am pretty sure they will be soon. With new things, it takes time to get everything together.  A year of Prime added is definitely an added bonus, even though I am already a Prime member. I am so glad to have a phone from Amazon!! This girl has left the Apple world and doesn't want to go back!!
This phone is awesome! It's very user friendly and I like that it is similar to my Kindle.
Great phone for my daughter she's 8 so the endless free apps are a life saver hours of fun
I like the phone, but I wish I loved it.  The Prime videos have amazing clarity. However my aggravation comes from the screen going black and not responding.  About once a week, when I press the home button, the screen will not wake up (I can hear sounds of apps opening), just no screen.  The only thing that will fix this bug is rebooting.  I THINK I know how to close the apps, but sometimes they refuse to close.  PrimeMusic would not stop playing, so often that I find myself rebooting my phone at least once every other day to "fix" bugs.  I often wish I would have gotten a Kindle instead.
I bought the phone because of the price. I love this Phone!! It is a good size and fast. Works well as a phone which was important to me as many smart phones don't any more. Great looking phone and great packaging ... Customer service is right on your phone with Mayday it is a touch of a button and is staffed with friendly people who understood my problems and fixed them right away. I love the map feature and find there are plenty of games and apps! And I got so many free things!! WOW!!<br/>1. Amazon Prime free movies music and apps and shipping<br/>2. $10 worth of coins to spend on amazon<br/>3. a boatload of free android apps<br/><br/>Phone works great! Battery life not so good but what phone is these days? You always have to charge them constantly ... I am very happy with my phone!!
This is just like my Kindle and seeing as how I'm addicted to my Kindle this phone ROCKS!
This is the best phone I've ever had, no joke. I have an iPhone 5C for work and have had two other IPhones for work. I have also had a bunch of Android phones and the fire phone is the best of both. The simplicity of the IPhone with the flare or uniqueness of the Androids. The lock screen 3d effect is amazing and the one handed features are just plain  great engineering. If you get this phone with an open mind you won't regret it. That being said I don't use a lot of apps so can't speak to that but love everything about this phone including the keyboard and overall features of the phone.
The biggest downside to this Android-based phone is its lack of compatibility with the Google Play store and Google Play services. That being said, some apps can be installed via apk files.<br/><br/>Unlimited photo storage in Amazon's Cloud Drive with the 14 MP camera was a good selling point.<br/><br/>I also find it a usable Kindle reading device when I'm waiting in line at the bus - I found the iPhone 4's screen to be too small for this purpose.<br/><br/>All being said, there are numerous improvements future generations of this phone can improve upon, notably on Apps selection.
was used to IPhone.  So its different have to get used to it.  The battery life is great
Great phone.  Fast.  Good hardware and I like the perspective modification for the time and lock screens, etc.  I wish the app store had more apps and was more compatible with android software at times... I.e. could not download the Suntrust App - not compatible.  I also cant seem to shut off the damn alarm when in the middle of a call... you have to exit the call and then shut off the alarm... annoying.  Overall though, nice phone, good functionality, good battery life, good range and signal strength and can run multiple apps at once with little notice of performance lag.
Great phone innovative but in my opinion over priced. Audio is weak<br/>And keyboard is too small
Very nice, Technology at its finest...grandsons like it and The hands-free is a plus.
Mom wanted an easy to use smartphone to upgrade her phone.  She loves her kindle fire so much that I decided to get her the fire phone.  So far she is raving about it.  She loves the quick menus that slide out and adapt to what she is doing.  Her only complaint is that she can't change the text size and maybe color in messaging.  We discovered the accessibility option to magnify but it would be nice to be able to just change the text size.  That and the limits on available apps are the only things keeping this from five stars.  Great job for a first try at a phone.
Works ok, but definitely different than your typical android.... However when I went to set up my secure email from work. (never had a problem with other android devices.) I get the following error. "The exchange account you are trying to add requires security features not supported on your fire. For more information, please contact your Exchange mail administrator."<br/>This is something that is not an option for me. I HAVE TO HAVE my work email on my hip. Too bad cuz I was looking forward to giving it a shot. Since I am such an Amazon fan.....
I don't know why people are posting bad things about fire phone, I love mine 100 %
Got the fire phone about a week ago. So far it's been a great device. I noticed a lot of negative reviews. I can't find anything not to like. There is a slight learning curve to the fire OS. But I think it's fun and refreshing. The battery life on my unit has been great. I haven't put it down much since I bought it, so I have been getting about 6-7 hours on a charge. I just purchased the Amazon leather case for it. I will probably do a review on YouTube soon. This phone will be my daily driver until Amazon releases a new one, hopefully next year.
Love the phone. Just can't get the apps I need like banking apps health care apps
I bought this phone thinking since I absolutely love my Amazon Kindles & love ordering through Amazon, I thought their phone would be a good purchase, especially with the Mayday app!  Wrong!! The Amazon Phone doesn't work for me.  Was not able to transfer phone numbers to car.  Many popular apps don't work on this phone.  Mayday service isn't really familiar enough with phone to answer most tech question on how to..... or why......  I am not a techie person so it took me awhile to figure out the apps that don't work on this phone like the apps I used to use on my previous phone (AT&T; HTC One phone)!<br/>Phone looks good, camera is good, but I certainly wouldn't recommend anyone purchasing it until there are better upgrades!  I'm sorry I bought it and now I'm stuck!  Amazon needs to desperately upgrade this phone fast in order to satisfy the customers they now have & with hopes of getting new customers!!
Let me say that Amazon is my favorite company bar none. I have been a customer since its website went live. Their customer service has gone the extra mile on several occasions to ensure that I was a satisfied customer. Today I am still a loyal customer even though I can find products cheaper elsewhere, the combination of very fast reliable service keeps me making 90% of my online purchases from Amazon. I am a big fan of the Kindle I started with the second generation and have purchased three and won one in an online contest.<br/>Now on to the Fire phone. After waiting for months in anticipation I am now sorry to say after seeing all the reviews and trying one owned by a coworker I will not be buying one.<br/><br/>The biggest issue for me is the Fire OS does not allow access to all the Google apps. I would have to give up dozens of apps I routinely use. The absence of Gmail, YouTube, Google Drive and maps is a huge negative in my book. The navigation seems over-complicated and counter intuitive.  Confusing menus (a couple of times I was lost just trying to go back to the previous screen) made for a frustrating experience.<br/>It has a mediocre battery life at best with no way to replace the battery with a backup. No support for 4.0+LE so many Bluetooth devices will not work with it.  The lower 720p LCD display resolution is a step backwards when compared to today’s flagship phones. There's no way to organize your apps, personalize the wallpaper and there’s no widget support. Having it locked in to just one carrier makes no sense.  Even if you purchase it at full price directly from Amazon the phone is locked.  Visually its heavy blocky design makes the phone seems more like a prototype rather than a final product.<br/><br/>How to fix the Fire phone:<br/><br/>1. Modify the OS<br/>2. Redesign the case<br/>3. Add removable battery<br/>4. Upgrade the battery to 2800mAh<br/>5. Provide a back button<br/>6. Allow the phone to be personalized<br/>7. Improve the Firefly app<br/>8. Solve the rapid overheating problem<br/>9. Increase the screen size and change the LCD display resolution to 1080p<br/>10. Make it $149 on-contract, open it to all carriers<br/>11. Drop the full retail price to $499 for an unlocked version
Still learning the phone every thing is great. Better than my iPhone.
Love it and am making progress in discovering all the great features.
Great looking phone. I have had more positive comments on this phone.
I actually kinda like my fire phone but some of the simple features of a phone are missing. I wish that you would do something so that I can have a background and a lock screen picture. The lack of ringtones and the ones that come on the phone are also a down side but there are also a lot of great things about the phone too. Like the dynamic perspective is amazing.and I love the three dimensional maps. I really like this phone but I would love this phone a lot more if you could just fix some of the simple things.
Phone works great. Only downside is some apps just aren't available.
Great size and weight. Not overly complicated to program or to use.
There are a few things that need to be worked on, like the fact that if I'm on my phone on someone calls it does not ring, or show I have a missed call until I click on the phone app and when I'm talking on the phone and have a case on I can't get the screen to come on to do anything until the other person hangs up. Also when I tap the home button to turn my screen on I have to hit it multiple times before it will come on. But other than that I love it
I love the phone and all its great features but on numerous occasions it is extremely annoying when I'm on a call and go to place someone on speaker or mute or if I need the keypad I accidentally hit the end key due to the fact that the icons are place to close together. This is a reoccurring issue for me and other workers who have the FirePhone. It is extremely annoying when especially being on business calls because my fire phone is a business phone.
Later this month, I will have had my fire phone for a year now. I like it's look, shape, and size. The battery has been good. I haven't had any problems with the phone. It's been a good phone and I am happy with it. My favorite thing about it is that it's connected to all my amazon stuff. The only negative has been that a few apps I would like to have are not available through Kindle. I hope in a year or so that Amazon will make a new updated version.
I LOVE THIS PHONE, IT DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH APPS AS AN APPLE BUT THE VIDEO QUILTY AND FREE ONE YEAR PRIME MEMBERSHIP MAKES THIS PHONE AMAZING, PLUS THE 13MP HD CAMERA WORKS SO WELL..... PLUS IT HAS ALL THE MAJOR APPS LIKE INSTAGRAM, FACEBOOK, TWITTER, SNAPCHAT ETC! WORTH GETTING THIS PHONE! ALL I WOULD LIKE AMAZON TO ADD IS MORE APP OPTIONS AND MAYBE NEXT GEN HAVE AN EVEN BETTER CAMERA AND TWO HEAD PHONE PORTS SO TO PEOPLE CAN WATCH A VIDEO TOGETHER!
Although many reviews mention the "without service plan" version as being "unlocked" it is in fact locked.  Used the mayday functionality on the phone, which was a very cool experience.  Amazon confirmed that they could not unlock the phone, only ATT could.  I contacted ATT and they refused to unlock  the phone.  Without freedom of carrier this device is not of use to me and I have returned it.
Someone from Amazon got a hold of me after seeing my review and was able to send me a replacement phone. I'm disappointed that I had to take it so far in order to get a solution but I'm glad that I don't have to deal with a cracked screen or pay for a new one. I am a huge Amazon fan, Kindles, Fire TV, Kindle FreeTime, Amazon Prime, so this phone is perfect for me. Thanks Amazon, I love you again!!<br/><br/>I bought this phone in August and 2 months later the screen cracks. Apparently this phone is too new and no one has the glass on hand to replace it. Not even Amazon or AT&T;!! I have been on the phone for the past 2 days with Amazon, AT&T; and all cell phone repair companies in a 50 mile radius and there is no solution other than to buy a new $550 phone. I have bought 6 Amazon devices including kindles, phone, Fire TV, not to mention weekly Amazon shopping as a prime member. Amazon tells me there is no way to get a discount and nothing they can do for me. I am very disappointed in the lack of solutions.
Overall operations of the Amazon fire phone are good. The hardware is spectacular in the fire phone. Much better than apple series. The only drawback to the Amazon fire phone is that the Google apps do not work with it. YouTube is hard to navigate using the browser instead of the app, many of the games are not on the App Store. But inconsideration with the hardware the phone is still worth the buy. I will continue to recommend Amazon fire phone.
Hardware is nice and the screen is gorgeous, however the native mail client is clunky and stalls frequently. The battery seems to drain rapidly lasting only 4-5hours... This is a huge problem and will hinder most people from keeping the phone. Native apps have reduced functionality, such as the audible app you cannot control play back speed and the kindle app doesn't have setting for night time reading. The amazon App Store is also missing key business apps such as Microsoft office apps, and you don't have access to the google play App Store.
I like the phone and the way it works.  This is my first smart phone, therefore I had no preconceived opinion.  I like the Kindle ability.  I am disappointed in the availability of apps.  The information page listed a large number of apps, some which I would want on my phone are not available for the Fire phone, such as Delta Airlines and SiriusXM Radio.  I find it misleading to have apps listed on the information page which are not available.
I absolutely love it!!!! I had Skepticism when I first bought the phone but after using it and dealing with it for the past few months it is actually been the best phone I've ever had I love the interface I love the picture quality I love the camera and the and sound quality the only thing I don't like about the phone is the voice assistant,  It's more limited than Google S Voice, But the rest of phone is great! Definitely recommend it!
I don't know what all the low reviews are for this phone is amazing I got it when it was on sale and I would have to say it's well worth the 200 dollars. people always compare this to other ios devices instead of seeing the phone for what it really is I find it to be amazing for what it can do yea the app market is limited but as to what I do it has all the apps I use anyways I always make sure to check the app market before I buy a new phone so it dosnt come as a surprise later.
Pros:<br/>Excellent battery life<br/>Easy to use<br/>Keyboard is more accurate and responsive than other e-keyboards I've used in the past<br/>Pictures are good<br/>Intuitive design<br/>Firefly is kind of neat (but really more novelty than anything)<br/>Like the fact the 3D wall paper changes daily<br/>It is NOT an Apple product<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Wish they made this in the Samsung Note size<br/>The wrist flick to other menus doesn't work as well as I'd hoped (or maybe I just haven't gotten the technique down)
I don't like that it breaks easy but other than that I love it!
It is so worth getting. Definitely better than my old phone. :)
I love my Fire phone.  It has great connectivity, beautiful graphics. I especially love the screen savers.  Please keep new ones coming. It does everything my iphone did. My transition was simple as AT&T; was already my provider.  Pairing the phone to my car is not possible as UConnect System has not added the Fire phone yet.  Do you have any influence in that regard?  When that happens, I'll be over the top!<br/><br/>Thanks<br/><br/>My phone has been paired to my car's blue-tooth system for several months.  GREAT PHONE!  5/13/2015
This phone got the worse write up of any other phone on the market. As far as I'm concerned, it's the corner of the market. By far, the best on the market. Perhaps a little more expensive then it needs to be, but considering who made it? You gotta make some sort of profit on a product you developed. Awesome phone, Amazon. Now if only you had a bluetooth device that matches the phone in quality and looks as good as the phone.
I love this phone. The only thing I dislike is that to delete all recent calls, text messages, or web browsing is to do it one at a time. I would rather just hit one button and delete them at once. Also, the phone doesn't talk to me like my iPhone did. It was easy to use this phone it didn't take me as long to get used to using as my other phone did. If you love your kindle as much as I do, you'll love the phone as well.
I love this phone. Amazon just keeps getting better and better
I pre-ordered my Amazon phone from AT&T; and received it this weekend.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Beautiful graphics and display<br/>Easy set up<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>Battery life is abysmal.  I am not a heavy data or minute user, but this phone couldn't stay charged for a full day. My previous phone, an iPhone 4 sometimes lasted 3 days.<br/><br/>I am also not a heavy user of apps. However there are several critical ones that I do need - and Amazon's proprietary apps do not have the ones I frequently use. Given the price of the phone and because I wanted a phone that would have access to specific apps that are not available, I returned the phone today and exchanged it for a Galaxy 5.<br/><br/>Very disappointed - I like Amazon and use many of their services,  but the Fire phone isn't one of them.
I've only had this phone for a few weeks now, but I love it. It is easy to navigate which is a big plus to me, and has a lot of neat extra features that make it special. The only thing that bothers me is not being able to see the time or my battery status at the top of the phone unless I am on the homepage. I have to get out of whatever I am doing to go check on those things. But otherwise I am happy with this phone.
For texting, websurfing, Facebook and email this is a great phone. The sound quality on my end is not the best for phone calls. People I am talking to have no problems hearing me but I often have trouble hearing them. Many times I have asked them to either text or facebook a message instead of talking. If my primary use was as a phone this would be a problem but it is not. I use the most for texts and emails. Love everything except the poor sound quality.
Very reliable , impressed with the camera and picture results
I am very happy with my Amazon Fire phone. I did some research before I decided to go with this as it did not get very good reviews. It looks like the biggest issue other people had was switching from the Apple or Google platforms. The Amazon platform doesnt have some of the apps on the other platforms. I have a kindle fire tablet and am on it all the time and I love it so knew I would love the fire phone as well
I was told I wouldn't like this phone since I was use to an Android, that it would be confusing. I took to this phone like a duck to water.  Being a Kindle Fire and  Fire HD user helped. It works like a mini pad with some differences. I love it. I can hear better with it than any other phone although I haven't tried it with my hearing aids in yet.  I can't say enough about this phone. I love it, can you tell?
Horrible.  I cannot use any apps due to not being able to use google play unless you can get someone to hack your phone and add it which makes this device useless if you want to use any apps since almost all of them need google play to enable the app.  I HATE THIS THING.  I have had 3 replacements due to malfunctions and the device still locks up and has terrible coverage.  I do not want this useless device.
This is the most complete cell phone, I really recommend it.
Couldn't be happier with the fire phone! Don't understand where all the hate for it is coming from. Battery life is great, durability and feel of the phone are also great, and the headphones that come with it are fantastic. The only things I would hope for improvement in the future would be added apps to get to the level of the iPhone and the Google Play store. Either way, extremely happy with this product!
I love the phone!  I'm not a game player or use a ton of apps. It has all the features I want, need and love!  I also like that's it's so easy to use.  I don't have to go hunting for my contacts or messages. I also like the fact that I can read my ebooks. That's a big plus when I don't have my Kindle with me.  I'm still learning about all the other features.  Overall, I'm quite happy I purchased the phone.
Love this phone!  I love my kindle fire and this blends them seamlessly.  I could geek out about this forever.  If you like a kindle fire, you will love the phone.  This is not an i phone, just like the fire is not an i pad.  Do not buy this looking for the apple product.  Buy this knowing that you will get a great phone with a great camera that is an extension of your kindle account.  Again, I LOVE IT!!
Former iPhone user and do not have plans of going back!<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>we bought 2 phones (husband and wife) love that we can view all pictures on both phones.<br/>syncs with our kindles<br/>easy to figure out<br/>easy to find downloaded app<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>not a lot of apps. would love to see Michaels, Joann Fabrics, HobbyLobby, starbucks, better run tracker apps<br/>Better ringtones
I love my Fire phone It works great. I get usually get over 24 hours  hours or so on a single charge and I use it constantly to read on. Never have dropped calls I got all sorts of free apps included in the deal plus one year of Amazon Prime. The Camera is astonishing. I take pictures with it constantly.  I would buy one again no problem! Thanks Amazon for putting out yet another great Fire Product!
I have always liked slider phones because of the capability to type fast. This phone has exceeded my expectations in so many ways! I can't understand why everyone isn't switching from the iPhone to the Amazon Fire! This phone has the capability of recognizing any music or television show. It also offers hand free scrolling to shop with such ease, and it ties you into your Amazon account with free Prime! It just doesn't get better!
This is our second fire phone.  I bought the last one for my wife.  Unfortunately I had not learned enough about my phone before I bought hers.  Because she is curious about how things work, I have learned a lot.  This phone will do everything I will need it to do for the rest of my life.  I am 70 and I do not like change but so far, this has been a very easy phone to grasp the potential of.
As a long time Prime member I picked one up recently for $189.  This included extending my Primer membership a year so the cost of the phone was $89.  What a deal at that price.  It's hardware is all really good, the software (Fire OS) is miserable.  I quickly installed the Google Play store and installed a new launcher.<br/><br/>For the extremely discounted price, it is a fine phone.  For the full price?  No way!
I could not get the hang of my first smart phone , but the fire phone is easy to learn , fun to use ,my grandchildren are impressed at me being able to use it and this phone's 3D screen is just super.<br/>This is the first time I have impressed my grandchildren with anything electronic.<br/>I use Amazon music , and shopping.<br/>How can this be the cheapest smart phone at AT&T; ?
Absolutely love my Amazon Kindle Fire Phone. Since I already have 2 kindles with lots of apps & books, all the information transfered to my new phone. If I reading a book on my kindle & then pick up my phone to read it takes me to the last page read. Love that I don't have to carry 2 devices with me when go out. The phone is also easy to use & has a very clear picture & screen.
Not being teck smari, I find this phone easy to use and learn more each time I use it.<br/>The personal one on one Help Desk Person is fantastic.<br/>I am witholding the last star until they fogure out why the telephone can not connect to the mobil network when I use it in my apartment in Rhode Island. Two sims cards and two fire phones and still no luck in that one location.
I love the phone since the two updates were completed. I wish there was Google Play store and still Amazon apps preinstalled...like the Nook from Samsung. I love the Dynamic Perspective and the video quality of the phone but I think 1920x1080 full HD or better resolution would be absolutely beautiful! I like the full highs and lows of audio on the speakers...not tinny at all!
I have been a Samsung user for about 8 years, this was a change, but I love my Kindle Fire and this is very similar. Works great as a phone, beautiful pictures. Only reason I have given it 4 stars is because the navigation in and out of apps can be trying. You have to Swype up to back out and some times it delays and sometimes on internet get stuck. But overall very pleased.
I just love this phone!!  I cannot go to Google, but I use my Laptop for that instead.  I was second guessing myself after I read the reviews on-line.  I needed a new phone, so AT&T; helped me out with this one.<br/><br/>Each day at first, everyone had to check out the screen saver.  Too bad there are not more to see.<br/><br/>Overall it is an awesome phone 5 stars =^.^=
I love this phone. I have had a lot of different types of phone since 1996 and I really feel what this phone has been the best one so far. (And I am very hard please when it comes to mobile technology!) If you want a multi-functioning, it's easy to learn and do without dropping calls. The description is under stated with which this phone can provide, even if you only use it as a "glorified rolodex of phone numbers" or even the note app for your grocery list and calculator.
It would be better if it had more apps to choose from.
This phone is everything I hoped it would be. The size is perfect; fits easily into my hand and the slot in my purse. I love the firefly app and the May Day app. If I would change anything it would be that there were more apps available in the store so that I didn't have to download them from the Internet. The camera is amazing and the sound quality is better than any phone I've had previously.
I bought this phone for my wife and chose it because of her Amazon affiliation.  Her first smart phone so she had no addiction to google or anything else out in cyberworld.  She has loved that phone and I have been really impressed with the ease of use and photo quality.  To me it's much more user friendly than my Android based phone.  Been a real hit in my house!
The apps available for the phone are limited and of little variety and compatibility with the ones I was able to use in Apple iPhone. The way the calendar works is very inconvinient since it is not an actual app on the phone. And does not sync with invitations interactively, sometimes not at all.  The fire fly however is innovative and so is  the mayday feature.
Any body considering buying a fire phone should do it stop thinking and go a head an order one I gave up a galaxy note #3 as good as it is it does not  have may day I have the fire 4 days and may day as been able to help me 3 times and it has fire fly just watch the video an get one you will be happy o yeah an a year of prime free.  May Day is so awesome  that is best feature ever .
I love my Fire phone<br/>It's perfect for my needs.
I liked my  first kindle I was wondering why they didn't come with a phone. And there it is a few years later..it takes awhile to get used to cause so much different than any other phone.  But I'm finally getting used to it..just using my old phone for apps that I can't get on the kindle phone..wished that they could increase the size of font n the texts..
Its amazing just wish the store had actual snapchat
Needs more apps, specifically ESPN fantasy football
I read good and bad reviews before deciding to give the Fire a chance.  I'm glad I did.  I've owned both Android and iPhones in the past; the Fire is a nice combination of both systems.  While there are fewer apps available, I believe it to be a result of Amazon's vetting process.  Maybe I'm giving them too much credit, but this is my justification.
I really like this phone.It is awesome.It texts calls quickly and it also holds an strong signal 90 percent of the time.Photo quality and screen graphics are very good.The screen also moves around when you move it.Plus it has movement options when you move your phone to the right or left and so on.It is really cool.I am very happy with my new phone.
I have really Kiev this phone. The Camera is great, the HD screen is awesome, and the apps are a plus. The only draw back is not bring able to download certain apps because amazon dos not have them on their serve. If amazon could branch out on the apps, this phone would be a highly competitive product against any other android phone on the market.
For the price I think it is an awesome phone. It works as an excellent hotspot and comes with a year of prime. I payed under $200 and you can get it cheaper now. For the original price tag of $750 I would give it a 2 or 3 star but for the price it comes at 5 star. Excellent product but if you are use to an android or iphone it is a tough switch.
I love my Fire Phone.  Always have been a Prime subscriber, but the Fire Phone totally uses your Prime subscription to the maximum benefit.  As with the Kindle, they are bringing new apps all the time.  But all the major ones are on board.  The phone is easy to use.  The camera is great.  I love the features, like firefly and the tilt scrolling.
Nice phone for seniors, much cleaner than android.
Im an iPhone user, after beeing blackberry for long time. I bought this Amazon fire Phone for use four days a week, I justo love ir. It cost me $ 150 and my iPhone 6 costed me almost a$ 950. I guess my Apple era is arriving to the end. I really congratulate Amazon and hope they will offer us with many modern devices in next months an years.
My fire phone is amazing I dropped it about 3 times and hasn't cracked yet and the 3D is amazing..  I love the app store a lot of stuff I want and more and the battery omg I was traveling to Massachusetts and I was at half battery and it was still on when I got back to New York I love this phone thanks amazon...the only thing is that u can't take the battery out but it's ok ill put a protection plan on it lol
There are some things about this phone that are out of this world awesome & others that are just flat annoying. The auto correct sucks, the web browser blows & the face tracking gets really annoying.<br/><br/>The camera is one of the best I've had in a phone. The battery life is surprising. Oh the price is on point. That's about it.
This phone is so user friendly. I only recently got this phone and can zip through everything with ease. Even for someone who is technologically challenged I have no problems with putting it through it's paces. I love that it's linked to my kindle as well so if I am from home and forget my beloved kindle I always have a book with me.
One of the best phones I've got since the galaxy s4
Works fine but having trouble getting ringtones.
Well for circumstances better than expected in ratio of operating versus units content still "Id like to own the world ,lol bit excellent phone fair price compared to what other offer and sale for so I will completey say satisfied looking forward to it having version update, depending on its success of which really matters.
Great product. No you cannot access the Google app store, but so far I have yet to find an app that Amazon does not have or doesn't have it's own version of that app. Runs great, battery does die quickly if you use the internet or game apps,  but charges very fast. Call sound is great, features are easy to use. Very cool phone
Like others I wanted to love it...but the functionality and apps that I have used on my galaxy to make my life easier don't exist with the fire. Inconsistent functionality with swiping, no privacy with Carousel function, no folders for your pictures, no customizing settings. But it's a shopping on Amazon BEAST....of course they got that right!
everything went as I come to expect from Amazon
I love this phone just as awesome as my kindle.
I had to rewrite this review because I answered a phone call and the phone blanked out and required me to restart. This phone has so many bugs that it will drive you nuts. Even though I will lose a lot of money returning it, I will do so tomorrow. The phone will freeze constantly, the swipes will fail often, the apps are still buggy, and the battery will have to be recharged throughout the day. I love Amazon but I'm really upset over this phone.
Great phone, but I'm still learning to use it.
Good phone. Just have to get used to the setup
Love this phone but have a few issues not even a whole month and back cracked. I dod not drop it Volume has issues. Sometime randomly the music goes really loud.<br/>I know it sounds like I am complaining but I am not. I absolutely LOVE my fire phone. I switched from being an iphone person and I am glad I did.!!!!!!
I really like this phone. I went from a semi-smartphone to this one and I am enjoying all the different features. It is so much fun to use. It takes great photos, I like the dynamic perspective and how interactive the phone is.<br/><br/>Check out a review I did on it on my blog: http://www.hellofelecia.com/review-amazon-fire-phone/
So far the phone is really great.  The only issue I have with it is the camera button on the side.  Any time it is in my pocket, I seem to hit this button and it takes it out of screen lock.  I am sure this will be fixed in a later update.<br/><br/>Overall I recommend this phone, especially if you shop on Amazon.
The phone has many features, however its difficultly to know how to work them. the battery life is really bad, you couldnt hear or feel the phone vibrate when there were incoming calls or texts, and not having google apps was inconvenient.  the apps weren't as great as google. had to return the phone and got the Samsung 5s active.
I actually like this phone. I know it has received a lot of bad reviews but so far it has be a really good phone for me. Was easy to learn all the many things this phone can do. Only bad thing is that I bought this phone when it first came out and paid the full price for it at that time. Oh well...live and learn!
I am so happy with my phone I'm Colombian! And this phone nobody has it here, some friends that have seen it they have said what amazing it is! Works well that many Androids I have bought in the past, I am not fan of iPhone like so many people so this was a good investment I'm sure I won't regret. Thanks Amazon!
I was extremely excited when I bought this phone back in April. There were small problems here and there but I thought it was because I was trying to get used to my new phone. I believe I was a sucker for this product because I love Amazon. Very disappointed and annoyed that I have to buy another phone already!
Takes  a little getting use to but I love it.
One of the most disappointing phones I have ever used.  I am an avid kindle fan, the Fire phone really had me excited.  Then, I got it, used it for almost two months, and have been so very disappointed.  It is constantly freezing up, won't go on the internet 80% of the time unless I restart the phone or turn it off and on.  Doesn't hold Wi-Fi settings well.  Overall, very cheap technology for a very expensive phone.
I love the new fire. Only problem I have is hitting the right letters when I type.  I am still learning how to use some of the apps  I moved from  a BlackBerry to the fire, and I loved the BlackBerry.  The fire to me looked more user friendly than the  IPhone.  One happy customer. Keep up the good work Amazon.
I may not be the most advanced in the technology department, but what limited knowledge and skills I have, I would rate this phone beyond excellent.  Regardless of all the things that the phone does not do, have, or functioning capabilities, what it does have works great for me and the customer service is by far the most outstanding quality associated with this phone.  Way to go Amazon....we are all entitled to our opinions but I would recommend this phone to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!
unfortunately neither amazon team neither At&T; will help you to sort out the problem !!amazon sells a locked phone without even informing you it is locked neither fixing your problem by providing the lock code,,,,and AT&T; is just the same mentality ,,, and you only bounce back and forth between both !!<br/>Shame on Amazon
No Google apps. No Google maps, no chrome, no Starbucks app, or any of the 1.2 million apps available in Google play. Any app that says available in Google play? Can't get it. No matter all the other wonderful things this device can do, they are useless with out the android apps. It's built on android but doesn't connect to most android apps?????? Ridiculous. I really regretting purchase. I hope that Amazon listens to customers. I am sooooooooo disappointed. I was really excited about the phone
I like this phone very much. It's fast, and has many fun features including good graphics, amazon video, and firefly. My main complaints are 1)  the app store doesn't provide all apps that you would find on an android or iphone, and 2) it's challenging to upgrade some apps including the my AT&T; application.
This is the first smart phone I have owned, so it's impossible for me to compare it with anything else. I'm still getting use to all the functions. I'm sure it's not perfect,but neither is life. I'm sure I'll survive. I don't get all the bad reviews. I guess all these "dirty energy" people never leave their homes.
This phone had alot of potential but I shouldn't of expected as much being the first prototype. Its not a bad phone at all just certain things annoyed me like not having a proper back  feature instead of hitting a button that takes you all the way to the home screen...but overall im content with the phone for now..
I was a little skeptical at first and while it does take some getting used to it's proof that change can be a good thing!! Before this phone I only wanted LG phones, I must say Amazon stands up to its reputation. I love my fire phone and won't be trading it in unless it's to upgrade the same brand! :)
I love it, it is easier to use then the Apple.  It is great for senior users. good enough for first time users as well.  I still need to learn the terms which means it is also good for Techies.  Guess it all means the favorites to each their own. But for me and my husband, we love the Amazon Fire.
Nice phone but available apps badly need an update. Unfortunately, most apps don't bother updating their software on amazon's appstore unlike google's playstore. Amazon should open up the fire to Google's playstore otherwise in less than a year my phone will be worth nothing more than a brick.
Great phone, great features...I love it 🙌
This phone is amazing. I really like the interface and functionality. I do wish the battery would last a bit longer as I can only get about a day and a half out of it but I use it a lot. I also wish there were more popular apps for it like Redbox, etc. Overall I would recommend this phone.
The phone is different and amazing but it needs more apps. There's no Bank of America app for example. The coolest thing is the 3D type view. You can literally use the phone with one hand! The sound quality is amazing and so is the video quality. A 13 mega pixel camera doesn't hurt either!
I don't like that Bank of America can't be accessed at all (i.e. website or app). Also the Amazon store doesn't have any of the apps that I used on previous phone & I can't download from the Android store even though I turned on the 'allow'. Lastly when I send videos via text the quality is horrible.
The Phone has its pro's and cons as any other phone, It works really well, the only downfall that I strongly hate the most about this phone is that I cannot download Google Play, which sucks bc I Love playing Clash of Clans so if they could fix that then this phone would be a 5 stars.
This is an awesome phone!  I was used to the iPhone, but it only took a few minutes before I was fully enveloped in the Amazon Fire Phone.  I read the reviews on it, but am not sure where they are coming from.  I thoroughly enjoy this phone.  Us just wish it had access to Google apps.
I am disappointed, I had no idea that I could not purchase/download any google apps, I also had a very difficult time transferring my contact list. and other information.  However, I am pleased with having all of my kindle apps, books and prime features on my phone.  The camera is awesome. ....
Apps are few and far between; I have had lots of issues trying to make calls (ie call either does not connect or if it does connect I can not hear anything) ; phone becomes hot if I am on the phone for more than 10 mins..  That includes using text messaging,  Facebook,  email,  etc.
This phone is the best available. The phoney comments about battery life are nonsense. It lasts longer than IPhone. The features are tops and the technology is trendsetting.<br/><br/>Be sure to get the 64MB, and enjoy Amazon's many things they begin to see as the future of phone.
I love my kindle, I was so excited over this phone. Biggest mistake ever! It shuts off, locks up, has stuff that will never be needed or used. Can only download from Amazon. Amazon doesn't have snap chat among others. Will never  use anything else but my HTC's again. Big big disappointment.
Works fine for me! The sound is amazing!
Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. I am upset that one of the Fire’s key features, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, comes with a hidden and harmful cost. Unlike Apple and Google who have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s data centers are powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary.
Amazon’s cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power.<br/><br/>Amazon’s Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary. Storing our photos, music and messages shouldn’t mean we are forced to damage the health of our climate and communities. Apple, Facebook, and Google have figured out how to store our photos and music with renewable energy, and so can Amazon
Now that Amazon has abandoned this phone, it would be nice if they could do one last update which would allow Google apps on the phone. I thought I could work within the limitations of this phone, but I was wrong. Thank goodness I spent less than fifty dollars on this thing.
The phone was easy to learn to use and I love having my Kindle books linked to it. The Mayday button is also very useful, and I've only had to use it twice. (Once, I admit, just to see what would happen ...) Battery stays charged quite well and no problems with phone calls.
This phone has way to many problems, right out of the box it did not work. The customer service through mayday was amazing. They tried everything they could. Hopefully the replacement they send me is functional or i will definitley stick with samsung galaxy phone.
Don't know how I managed without it.
A great phone! I love the ability to sync all of my Amazon details.<br/><br/>One thing that should be said is that this is not a simple phone. If you prefer very simple operating systems on your phone I would consider going with another mobile device
The battery life is horrible and the phone gets hot.  Tried to return it but didn't think I should have to pay a $35 restocking fee.  So now I am stuck with it.  It does have some cool features but I cant enjoy them because I am too busy charging my phone.
This is my first smart phone and I was a little worried it would be too complicated. It is very easy to use and actually feels easier to use than my old slide phone. I don't need all of the features but I am having fun exploring them. I went with the Fire phone because I am a huge Amazon fan and long time customer. The strange thing is those Amazon apps for shopping, prime music and viewing are the ones I never use. I prefer to use my laptop for shopping. I don't want to purchase anything by phone for security reasons. I use the apps for free applications. I use facebook occasionally but noticed the update is very slow and my feed shows posts that I have already seen previously. I have linked my gmail accounts and that works well for two of my gmail accounts, the third does not work as it is through my University and evidently a third party account will not allow access, which is a big reason I bought the phone, so I could access my school email while on campus. Warning: if you link to gmail all of your email contacts will be imported to your phone contact list. I do not like this feature and have not figured out how to change it. It makes the contact list harder to navigate when looking for a contact.  I use the maps application and it has served me well. But I purchased the phone primarily to use for my extended trip to Europe and it was useless. Even after AT&T; unlocked it for me, I could not use it with a different sim card. None of the applications worked and I ended up disabling everything and not using it at all. If you travel, don't buy this phone, it is useless in any other country but USA. I will be purchasing another smart phone when my contract is up, probably an i-phone that I know will work internationally.
Real nice features and lots of potential for the dynamic display and firefly.... it's something new to the market and I love the change from iPhone 5s ....the screen is the right size. Amazing earphones. Just waiting for more apps on the appstore....
My boyfriend and I each got the fire phone after his iPhone got stolen. We wanted to try something new. There are a lot of cool features on the fire phone, like the firefly and the 3D-movement. However, there are way too many bugs for this to be with your money. This biggest flaw was simply the service. There were so many times where we wouldn't receive important phone calls or texts until we used the phone to call out or text someone. Needless to say, a phone's number one job is to be a phone. If you can't do that, then none of your features even matter. We both ended up getting in trouble at our jobs over missed messages and we had to get rid of it. We both wasted $200 on this thing.<br/><br/>So many bugs that when I tried to use simple features such as the camera, it would freeze up and stop working. It also does a thing called "best shot" photo, which I didn't mess around with, yet somehow it ended up taking up so much room on my phone when I looked at the storage info that I couldn't even take pictures. Furthermore, there is no app or any easy way at all to transfer your pictures. I found out you can download something to do this, but it's some obscure app that wouldn't work with my MacBook Pro. So that completely sucked. Clogging my memory with no way to empty my phone easily; the best shot photo storage (whatever that even is) took up more room than my pictures plus everything else combined.<br/><br/>The autocorrect was actually pretty good, as well as the voice recognition. The map was pretty awful, and wasn't able to give me any kind of good traffic update: it would say traffic is totally fine, then if I reopened it immediately after it would say traffic was awful and in the red. It was worse when I was already completely stopped on the freeway and it's telling me the freeway isn't backed up at all. Very unreliable.<br/><br/>This phone like any has a private browser mode which I get that people like, but it is a little annoying to me since we all know it's only for porn watchers to hide their use from their spouses or significant others or whoever else. Supporting that annoys me, but every phone does that these days so it doesn't set them apart for supporting that junk.<br/><br/>It's heavy, but that didn't bother me so much. Apps were basically piggybacking off of android apps, so many of them didn't work well on the phone and many of them actually caused the whole phone to freeze. The phone actually restarted on me a couple times, and other times I had to restart it.<br/><br/>It had an option to tilt the phone to scroll, which sounds cool - but I just had to turn it off because it is so sensitive. Anytime I held my phone and moved just slightly it would start scrolling quickly down or up and I would lose my place. Even setting it down, if the surface appeared level but maybe it was slightly off, the phone would randomly start scrolling while sitting on the table. Super annoying.<br/><br/>I liked that you could swipe to go back, but since you also swipe to scroll, it caused a lot of problems if you're trying to stay on the page and read. It would freeze on the Internet and sometimes it was really hard just to get any navigation buttons to pop up. Which can be a disadvantage to any phone/screen without many buttons. I do like that this had more buttons. No easy way to switch from vibrate to ringer though which really sucked.<br/><br/>One cool feature is that you can set an alarm for a day of the week, but if you don't pay attention that can easily make your alarm not go off if you thought it was set for the next day (especially if you set it around midnight). Calendar worked well, but it was less user friendly than I would have hoped, and you can't set multiple reminders for calendar events :(.<br/><br/>Netflix app worked awesome. So that was cool. I loved that you could set the background to change from one moving picture to the next. But this of course was awful on the battery. Even with that off, the battery died so quickly. Luckily the charger was great quality and in my opinion way better than most chargers I have had for any phone. Kudos there. I love Amazon chargers for any device. And it was great to share a charger with my kindle.<br/><br/>So overall, the bugs need worked out! It might be an awesome phone one day, but it was a nightmare for me; mainly for the phone service not working no matter how much trouble shooting I did. But also so much freezing and malfunction elsewhere. I don't advise it unless you don't care about malfunction.
I typically don't write reviews but I feel like this phone has a bad wrap.  Today I literally returned my galaxy S6 to return to this.  I used to love my S3 and S4, S5 was disappointing, S6 in my opinion is awful.  The screen is the only thing that made the S6 worthwhile.  It's beautiful, that's where it ends.  The huge advantage to the galaxy was the removable and swappable battery, hiking, camping what have you a backup was available.  Now the battery that you cannot switch would die in less than an 8 hour day.  I got so fed up with charging my phone throughout the day I had to return it.  If they wanted to follow iPhone and remove all the features that made them unique I will gladly return to Amazon, where my internal battery lasts morning to night.  Email is easy to navigate, folders are organized. Amazon doesn't feel the need to change what gestures or buttons to.  My items are quickly backed up without 58 different background applications asking for access to all my information, how many times do you need to accept terms?  Amazon may be invasive, but they're quiet about it.  Let me link my Google account to my Samsung account to my cloud back up, oh wait can Facebook access my Samsung account and see my Google information?  Not now? every 5 minutes until you say accept? Ok, now every task I try to perform I have to select from 15 different applications that can open that one file, but I clicked the wrong one! Now I have to navigate through the bajillion settings so that I can say oops I always want Adobe to open my PDFs.... ugh I'll keep my Amazon phone over that uncomfortable polished gem, I think they make it as slippery as possible to ensure you drop it to buy accessories or ultimately a replacement.  That is my daily rant, why Amazon fire phone is the best phone today.
This is the second Amazon Fire Phone I have received, it was replaced under warranty, because I bought it in January of this year via the AT&T; Next Plan. I was having issues with the first phone two days after purchase. The Sim card they gave me freaked out on my phone, it caused me to not be able to call out, or send texts at all. I could only receive calls, I could receive text messages but could not send any out. I could not get on the Internet, it could not access any of my apps at all. After that was fixed my phone was alright for about a month. Then it started messing up again. I did troubleshooting, And after doing a 40 sec. reset, taking off my screen protector and case Because I was told that the fire phone is so new that there's not enough data to support which case and screen protector are the best. And that those could be messing with the sensors and the phone.<br/>I was finally told that it was because of a preinstalled app on the phone. Meaning one of the apps installed on the phone before I purchased it. When I asked what app it was they said the troubleshooting just determined it was a preinstalled app but did not know which one was causing the issue. I ultimately ended up having to do a factory reset, and even that did not work. I am having the same problems as the previous phone and they are worse. I have already done the 40 second reset with this phone.<br/>Screen Blacking Out.<br/>Phone Cutting Off.<br/> Apps Freezing.<br/>Touch Screen Not Working.<br/>Messages Not Sending.<br/> Internet Browser kicking me off the internet, after freezing.<br/>Buzzfeed App. Not loading.<br/>Tumblr App freezing up, and not responding to closing this last ten days days.<br/>Being heard while my phone is on speaker or connected to the car stereo via Bluetooth is impossible unless my windows are up, the  a.c. is off and I am leaned all the way in to the phone, as close it is to my ear when I use it handheld.<br/>Spotify App. Freezing and blacking out mid song.<br/>Firefly not working as an app. Not registering music at all.<br/>Amazon Music Player, not playing. Only loading continuously.<br/>Email apps not showing a new email has arrived.<br/>Email Apps Freezing, not sending, opening, deleting, or even typing the email out.<br/>Voice text disconnecting while the phone is connected to a network.<br/>Automated Suri like helper not working 7 times out of 10.<br/>Route and directions on maps app, freezing and erasing halfway to destination. Are a few of my problems.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this to a friend. The best things about this phone, are the camera, the one year of prime free, the storage, and the access to Amazon music.<br/><br/>But there are now Androids out with the same amount of storage. A better app market, and I'm fairly sure you can still access Amazon music.
Update 3-24-15: So the replacement (refurbished) phone I just got 8 days ago now will not TURN ON! I was looking at it--74% battery--when it turned itself off and will not turn back on-even on the charger. It will charge (it's at 79% now) but won't turn on on or off the charger.<br/><br/>I bought this phone through AT&T; & I have had it for 6 months and 7 days.<br/>Good:<br/>I love that it came with a year of Amazon Prime (added to my current year) and Kindle , the dynamic perspective, firefly, and swivel features; It's also easy to use (though IDK if my grandmother who's tech challenged could use it). Another thing I love is the flashlight option right there on the swipe down. The camera is great--esp since I take a lot of pictures and tend to forget my DSLR. It fits in my hand well (it's too small for my husband's liking though). The screen is a little small to watch movies on but it will do in a pinch and the sound quality is good. The carousel is a nice feature too. It's battery life is okay--however, don't keep Bluetooth on unless you are using it as that WILL drain it, and I don't "care" if my HD is on so IDK if that would drain it.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/>At 4 months I started having issues charging it in the car--it had to be sitting a certain way or it would not charge (I even bought a new USB cord to make sure it wasn't the cord-it wasn't). That was tad bit annoying but not something I couldn't deal with.<br/>At 5 months my screen faded (for lack of a better word) which (while it still worked) was annoying. I tried turning it off then back on, turning it off and letting it sit, etc. That afternoon I called AT&T; about the warranty but while I was on the phone with them the phone shut itself off, came back on, and was fine again. Weird, but whatever.<br/>This morning I woke up to find out it didn't charge last night, I had 14% battery left. I checked to make sure it was plugged in (it was) tried the plug at another outlet, tried the USB with my computer, tried the USB cord with a different phone (worked fine) and tried my phone with another USB (still wouldn't take a charge)...so I gave up and called AT&T.; They told me it was still under warranty, but even with the other issues I couldn't just get a new (different type of) phone unless I wanted to pay out the remaining on this one. They then had to transfer me to Amazon for the actual warranty.<br/><br/>Brittany (with Amazon) was very helpful and didn't mind the interruptions by my kids; At this point I have 5% battery. She had me plug it into the computer so that I could make everything up (the USB worked fine with this so it was definitely that the phone just wouldn't charge) that wasn't automatically backed up with cloud such as my contacts. She also helped me back sure my other things were for sure backed up to the cloud etc.<br/><br/>My new phone is set to arrive Sat. I'm hoping that I don't have any issues with this one.<br/><br/>TLDR: Features are great, battery not so much.
I love the kindle devices for my kids as they do kids right with their free time settings. In as much as I thought I would love this phone, I have come to realize it's an "ok" phone as I use my phone mostly for calls, texts and emails. That being said it is a bit disappointing that the app market is still lacking a lot of software that I like to use from time to time, and the fact you can't use "any" of the Google apps or watch YouTube decently on the device is a bit frustrating at times. If I could return it, I would, but for now will have to live with it. (Would also be nice if they could make the Planet Puzzles a little more challenging)<br/><br/>I have had issues in the past with the system restarting on it's own, locking up and the touch interface would stop responding, however after the last update, I haven't seen any of those issues appear. Some of those issues may also have also been related to some of the apps I was testing and no longer use.<br/><br/>Firefly sorta works, many times when I have tried to use it while shopping would result in different items then the one scanned or it wouldn't find them at all. Tried image look-ups, bar code look-ups etc. Seems their database may be a bit limited for the firefly feature, at least from what little testing I have done, thus I don't use it. (pretty much have forgotten it even exists, except for when I press the button accidentally, or press it to try and turn on the camera).<br/><br/>Buttons on the device, or at least on mine, are a bit sensitive. I carry my phone in my front pocket and the buttons are being pushed to easily.  If I lock the phone with a pin then there seems to be fewer issues. I also got the amazon case as it helps with the buttons on the side of the phone, but does not help with the home button (which is was the main issue).<br/><br/>Anyway, was really hoping for more, just looking forward to upgrading when I can at this point and living with what I have.
This is by far the best smart phone I've had ( and I've had several); I love it! This phone has a lot to offer with all that it can do, especially the dynamic perspective firefly, and May day (which I tried out today and was assisted by a very helpful customer service associate, who screamed genuinely happy to help me and solve my trouble. By the way it was nothing major either; I could not get my phone dial pad to stay visible. The screen kept going black when I made a call. Problem: I still had the plastic covering on the phone that it had shipped in and it was blocking one of the sensors. He had me take it off and problem solved!) . I had read some fairly adverse reviews before purchasing this phone but I'm a die hard Amazonian an knew they wouldn't let me down and I was right! All the functions and apps are easy to use and download and for the many individuals who said that you can't download many of the apps you currently have through Google play; that is false as well. The Amazon app store has many of the same apps as Google and if that doesn't help you can always side load an app as well ( with caution of course). There is also no problem syncing an accessing your email accounts either; including Gmail. I also read a couple reviews that stated that the phone does not just get warm but hot and does not have a long battery life. I have used my phone, literally, all day; downloading apps, music, and books. I also read a book for over an hour on this phone , streamed music, and my daughter watched video and this phone did not even get warm!  Before using my phone, I charged it to 100% and after the ENTIRE day and doing all of the above, I still have plenty of battery life left. I can't say enough about this device! Once again, great job Amazon!
It could have been so much more. I'm a bit disappointed.<br/><br/>The carousel is practically useless. Its only purpose is to show what the latest programs you used, i.e. a process list. It would've been much better if you could control what's on there and programs showing pertinent information to its function (task/todo programs showing tasks, etc), and not just recommendations to buy other programs of the same kind (I only need one task management program, don't need recommendations for 20 other ones). Also, why do I have to see every album I've downloaded there as a program? Or 20 top books from my Kindle account? Or every audiobook? It takes 30-40 swipes to get to the programs I want to use in the carousel. It's faster to just open the application screen. The carousel is useless. Amazon needs to improve this feature drastically or people will be turned off and carousel to another phone over time. So this is what I want there: 1) full control of what is showing, swipe up to remove something would for instance help (now you have to click and hold and select remove), 2) don't show media files as apps on it (option to turn on or off maybe?), 3) more apps need to show the content relating to what its doing rather than recommendations for shopping more (task programs showing tasks, note programs showing top notes--just like widgets can do in regular Androids).<br/><br/>Why is it that Amazon's music and audio players are better on the regular Android than on Fire? The interface is better on Android for both programs. The music player doesn't show if a song is downloaded or not in the cloud? You have to click and hold to see if "download" is available. I don't know. And if a song is playing, you have to click on that tiny little arrow up in the left corner to go back to the album to choose another song. I think the Apple Nano with extremely limited interface is easer to use.<br/><br/>For years I've been waiting for Immersed reading/listening. It's very cool that it's finally here, if it was here... It's not working that great. The wrong text is highlighted while audio is playing and the saved bookmarks are not synced properly somehow. When I switch to the kindle book, it didn't pick up where I was in the audio player but placed me 3 chapters ahead, then when I switch back to audio book, then it did pick up the wrong place in the kindle book. So I'm not using those features for now until they work better.<br/><br/>Lastly, I don't think the battery is that amazing. It's a little bit better than the other phones I've used, but I was sold on some amazing battery performance that I can't see. It's just okay.
Simply amazing, so simple and easy.
Still learning, but like it so far!
love this phone it is really differnt i do have some ups and downs with it i just know that there are update coming out soon that will fix the little issue, i just hope they make another fire phone they will understand the mistake they made hear
Best phone I ever had. Easy use clean look. 3D perspective does take a little to get used to but, once you do you don't want to go back.  Never want another phone. And the price is fantastic.  For the first attempt at a phone Amazon nailed it.
Great phone and love the year of prime with it.  Only drawback is that it will not accept apps from google play as all apps must be through amazon appstore.  Which would be fine except they don't support some apps such as my insurance app etc.
Three months in, and I love this phone still.<br/><br/>Wonderful MAYDAY feature was VERY helpful today:  Dismayed by the poor reviews, I went back to look at the POSITIVE ones...to make sure I wasn't delusional. There I came across the solution to the one thing I perceived as a "problem:" Paying $200 for it before Amazon dropped the price to 99 cents. (Don't you hate it when that happens??) One reviewer disclosed that someone answering the Mayday call would refund the difference.  Well, sure enough, they DID!!<br/><br/>That's why Amazon is my favorite retailer of all time.  And that's why I'm their best advertiser, telling all the people I know about my continued great experiences with them.<br/><br/>THANKS, JEFF!!<br/><br/>I never cease to be AMAZED by this phone!<br/><br/>Besides the ease of use for "normal" tasks, with superb voice recognition, its features make is SO much more than a phone: it's a handheld computer that can make phone calls.  I use it as my Kindle reader out on my porch while streaming music, all with the wi-fi setting.  It's the first phone that makes it relatively easy to surf the web: just hold the home button, and ASK!  This is my first smart phone, so I am enthralled.  There seems to be a free app for everything one might like to do, also.<br/><br/>IF there is a question about anything, pressing the "?" will get you live help within 15 seconds.  A friendly, English-speaking rep walks you through the process in question, taking command of your phone to show you how, if need be.  All this without making you feel like an idiot for asking.<br/><br/>This is the first Fire phone to be marketed, so features WILL be added.  It's so cute: when asked to "Play James Taylor," it says, "I'm sorry.  I can't do that YET."  Updates to existing software will increase the already impressive capabilities.<br/><br/>Battery life allows 6-8 hours of constant use, which I think is pretty good, and charging takes 2 hours.  Under normal use, battery would last most of a day, at least.<br/><br/>OH! Almost forgot about Firefly:  amazingly id's any song, movie, TV show or product code in seconds!  SO COOL!  And of course Amazon tells you where to buy it. Dynamic perspective is a bit of fun, with fascinating new screen savers every day: also allows to see "under" certain menu items.  Haven't tried it for gaming.  Camera is great, with options I've not learned to use yet.<br/><br/>Using Amazon Cloud for content makes this one entertaining creature. A big YES on the Amazon Fire phone!
I have bought two fire phones now. The first still works, but cracked due to me smashing it with a ping-pong paddle, so I bought another. The interface is the best mobile UI I have encountered and there is rarely ever lag. It is a great buy.
I was really exctied to try this phone and really wanted to love it.  I was drawn for a couple of issues, first the free year of Prime, I figured since I was already a Prime member it made the price of the phone reasonable.  My old Iphone 4S was starting to have some issues so I was in the market and thought the features this phone offered would fit with my needs.  I'll start with some of the positives as I don't want to sound like I just miss my Iphone.  The larger phone and screen are very nice, as are the 3D graphics.  I like the fact that when sending a text or email  you can just run your fingers over the letters you want when typing instead of having to hit each letter individually.  I really like the Firefly application though it is somewhat inconsistent and doesn't always work.  The Amazon music is also a nice feature, although there are some issues with syncing to the vehicle blue tooth. It doesn't automatically start playing music, you have to open the application, go into downloaded music, go into play list etc.. way too many steps.. There are also several applicatons that are not accessible (I am assuming Google Apps ) and really wish the companies could reach some kind of agreement to allow access. Driving when trying to use the hands free help is also glitchy.  If I ask for instance to dial someone in my contacts and I have both a cell number and a home number.. The "siri" will say would you like me to call the first # listed or the second # listed.  If you try and clarify and say call the cell phone, "siri" will not recognize your command.. and say either speech not recognized, or I'm sorry would you like the first or second #.. The concept of the flick left or right to get to the various screens was also a great feature, however I have read some other reviews says it's inconsistent and I would have to concur.  I have several other concerns, but I will address probably the largest one that I have last.. Text messaging.. When I first got the phone, I would not receive any of the text messages I received from I phone users, or they would show up on my old phone that was in my house.  I went through Mayday ( a fairly good feature) to correct the problem , they talked me through disabling text feature on my old cell.  However I sometimes still do not receive messages from people, this is especially true if I send out a group text.. Friends will ask if I got there response and my answer is usually no.. If I give my number to someone who is not currenlty in my phone, and they text me from a Iphone, I will not receive their message ever.. Very very frustrating.. I think the concept of the phone is great, but there are some major issues that need to be addressed, and now I am stuck with a phone for the next 2 years that I am really not happy with.. I wish I had waited for the second or third version to come out and upgraded my old phone.  Sorry Amazon this one kind of missed the mark..
Okay, I've had it for less than a day, but have to get some messages to Amazon to fix this guy up.<br/><br/>Pro so far:<br/>Display is good but auto setting on screen always has it dark.  Went to manual mode for that.<br/>Account set up.  Amazon easy, emails with ISP and other services real simple. Didn't have to look up the server names and ports, had them all.<br/>AT&T; mobile transfer worked fine.<br/>AT&T; service transfer: stopped the old phone service fast, new phone had to call. But might save you here, power off phone first and see if it finds it when you start back up.  Kudos to AT&T; support, they wouldn't hang up until all was confirmed.  Phone, internet via 4G and voicemail.<br/>Gestures seem useful. Time will tell<br/>Button layouts, jacks etc.  Like any other.<br/>Cons<br/>Call volume.  Needs some work here.  Don't know whether it's me or not.  Seems a little muddled.<br/>Heat - definitely runs hot.  Not a good thing here.  First iPhone ran like this and had nothing but troubles.<br/>Battery - so far lousy.  Does charge fast.  But ran out in less than 5 hours.  Ugh.<br/>APP<br/>well did this to myself.  I only use a few apps regularly.  Saw that they were in the Appstore, so "assumed" they would work with Fire.  Well that was wrong.  Was all ready to spend the money on replacement apps and they weren't even there.  Found a different one for golf GPS.  Thankfully that had a trial version.  Has crashed every time I've tried it.  I'll pass along that review.<br/>Tune-in radio works.  But geez, Scrabble isn't available?  That was the first app the iPhone advertised.  Very disappointed.<br/><br/>This review is a work in progress and I'll update in a month (like I'm sure a whole lot of people will).  For now, trying to get the messages to Amazon to get some fixes going and pushing support for all apps not to mention heat and battery.
I intend to update this when I know more about the phone. Preliminarily, I can say the following:<br/><br/>Amazing sound and ear bud quality. They are magnetic at the bud and so they don't tangle as easily as other buds I've used.<br/><br/>Amazing visuals, and of course, the dynamic perspective is beautiful. The phone was set on a counter in front of me and, as I moved from side to side in about a three foot swath, it dawned on me that it actually looked different from different angles; for some reason I'd assumed it was the action of tilting it that changed the perspective. Silly of me? Yes, but what made it weird is that the change in perspective wasn't a smooth shift: It "swooped" in a way that made it appear that the phone was actually the one moving and the picture was gyroscopically changing itself. Very weird--and cool.<br/><br/>The phone dropped a wireless signal at a time I wasn't expecting it to--inside a house. I still don't know if the music I was trying to download to the device actually made it there. The phone said the download failed, but then it seemed as if the music eventually made it. At least in "cloud" mode, you can see the lyrics of the music you're playing, and it scrolls down just like a karaoke machine. Pretty wild.<br/><br/>I'd have rated this 5 stars if the device didn't get so physically hot so easily. It was in the high nineties this afternoon, the phone was in my jeans pocket, and I was in a slightly shaded area tossing chunks of wood into my truck. I hadn't used the phone in an hour and it was actually uncomfortable on my leg in the pocket. Not cool--literally.<br/><br/>There's probably so much more to say, but this is a start. If I thought the heat was a deal-breaker, I'd not have given it 4 stars...
Received as a gift, and I'm very happy with it.<br/><br/>Free year of amazon prime (stacks with existing subscription) effectively cuts the price by $100 for anyone inclined to use prime and coming up on the end of their prime subscription -- Makes this phone an absolute bargain.<br/><br/>All the buttons are on the opposite side compared to every other phone I've ever owned.  Weird, and ergonomically annoying.<br/>Tech specs are impressive, and net-net they give the phone a superior responsiveness.<br/>32GB of storage (mine is the lower, 64GB is available) is a ton.  No microsd expansion, but you probably won't need it.<br/>Dynamic Perspective lock screen is a tad gimmicky, but really shows off advanced phone capabilities.<br/>The home page features the "Carousel" navigation style, is attractive.  Scrolling through apps one at a time is super-tedious and it requires a fair bit of curating to keep it from being unusable.<br/>The "alternate" home page (app grid) is everything you'd want from that type of interface<br/>The camera is good. Hardware camera button makes it very accessible, but unfortunately I bump it too frequently doing other things with the phone and the camera mode constantly interrupts me.  Especially because the buttons are on the wrong side of the phone.<br/>Integration with other data (mail, calendar, etc) is flawless.<br/>Amazon App store is awesome with tons of free apps.<br/><br/>However, it took a little effort to get Google Apps installed.  Lots of mainstream android apps are not available through amazon store (e.g. Bank of America's mobile app, BubbleUPNP).<br/><br/>Gets hot-to-the-touch sometimes.  Not sure why.<br/><br/>Update: Docking stars.  OTG adapters don't work on this phone.  Hunting around forums online, it's clear that Amazon intentionally disabled this from base Android for malicious reasons.  It makes me slightly angrier about the lack of MicroSD expansion.  Seems that the device has been intentionally hacked to break Netflix/Youtube integration with Chromecast from apps that support Chromecast.  Device also seems (once again, intentionally, maliciously) to interfere with license checks on Google Play Store apps -- which is infuriating because a LOT of really cool apps don't exist in Amazon Marketplace (like most "old game console" emulators).  In fact, the range of "amazon customizations" that have been made exclusively to disable Android features is staggering.
After a month of use I can say with certainty that I do not like the phone.  It does many things well, but the things it lacks or are buggy are enough to make this phone a dud to me personally.  The lowering of price 1 month later was a punch to the throat.(EDIT Amazon refunded me the difference, kudos!)<br/><br/>Like:  The screen is vibrant; The weight, it is heavier than some other phones and it feels solid to me; Prime integration; Call quality is great.<br/><br/>So/So: The dynamic perspective and firefly are fun for a while, but serve no real purpose other than the WOW factor; the volume buttons don't feel right, like they are misplaced or something; the virtual keyboard doesn't "flow well"(this may be just me)<br/><br/>Bad: Virtual keyboard bugs out once a day and requires me to reboot; auto brightness will go insane sometimes and work backwards (bright in dark, dim outside) and require a reboot; lack of basic well known apps;  battery life is TERRIBLE, i have not been able to get through a whole day without either getting critically low or having it die; the phone will randomly turn off the display and will not turn back on for a few seconds; notifications for text/email/phonecalls sometime do not fire...<br/><br/>All in all I would say if I could get a refund and go back to my original phone I would.  When I do find a new phone, resale of this to recoup some of the financial loss will be non-existent(amazon refunded my purchase price so this is a non factor, leaving for review integrity).  This was a good effort, but a lackluster execution.  I would be happy and stick with it if it weren't for the bugs that inhibit the basic use of the phone.  Having to perform daily maintenance on my phone makes this a regretful purchase
To start, for all the 1 star reviewers, I'm glad I didn't listen to what you said, whether it was about the actual phone, or Amazon's cloud storage. It seems a lot of people were expecting this phone to be the most innovative, exciting and breathtaking product to ever hit the market. To be honest, I think in a lot of ways it is, but it is still a phone at its core, not a super computer.<br/><br/>The good...<br/><br/>As a phone, call quality is great, better than my blackberry which I thought had amazing call quality, this is much better. Speakerphone also works better than other phones I've had.<br/><br/>Email functionality is very good, another area I thought I would miss my blackberry, but it color codes my different gmail accounts so I can sort through work and personal easily.<br/><br/>Overall all my business uses for the phone work great on this, gmail, google drive, google calendars, my surveillance system monitoring, facebook page managing, all made simple on this phone.<br/><br/>Firefly has come in handy on a few occasions during shopping, hearing a song I want to have, and reading business cards to quickly add contacts.<br/><br/>Love the music app, only thing I'm not sure of, why prime music and the fire music app aren't one? I recently realized on some songs it'll display the lyrics, karaoke style, pretty neat.<br/><br/>First thing I did was went through all the settings and customized the phone just the way I wanted it, which I think is something a lot of people didn't do, because you can change a lot of things to work the way you want.<br/><br/>Battery life is very good now that I've gotten through the first few days of constant use, or just poking around.<br/><br/>The bad...<br/><br/>I need to figure out how to disable the voice command button while the screen is locked, I keep hitting it in my pocket and getting annoyed with that.<br/><br/>I have noticed the phone being a bit warm coming off of the charger, but not to the point where it made me nervous. Granted I'm used to being in a kitchen for work so heat doesn't bother me so much.<br/><br/>Overall...<br/><br/>I'm coming off of having a blackberry torch for the past 4 years or so, so I think most new phones are impressive. I got the Fire phone because of the integration with all the Amazon services, and to be honest I'm barely using it for that purpose. It's there when I need it, and not intrusive at all, which I think was done very tastefully. Everything about this phone has impressed me from the start and I'm still discovering things after a month. I suggest to anyone who is on the fence to try it out. Unless you decide otherwise beforehand, you will most likely end up loving this phone.
Ok, I have owned Android phones for a while. My brother in law loves iPhones. I personally don't. But I think this does a great job of bridging the gap. Love the size. It's not heavy and it's not a giant brick either. The S5 is a bit big so this is a good compromise in size between the Samsung and the iPhone.<br/>The microphone is a little tricky since it is a small one and I have a tendency to put my hand on it.<br/>The system is easy to use and has some cool features. I don't use the Firefly feature much if at all but I can see the use and it works great. I tried it a few times and never had a problem.<br/>The camera button on the side, just great! And the pictures are clear and vibrant.<br/>There is no Google playstore on this but the Amazon App store has most everything and it is getting more every day.<br/>The headphones take getting used to. I don't like the way they feel. Gave them to my son. He loves them. They are neat, no tangle and magnetic for when you want to put them away or only use one ear, you can attach them to each other. But they are not comfortable in the ear without a lot of work to situate them.<br/>The Dynamic Perspective is great. Though there are not enough apps with that ability but I expect that will change quickly now that it has been released.<br/>Carousel is great. well done.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>size<br/>picture quality<br/>ease of use<br/>sleak design<br/>average battery life (same as the other guys, no shock there)<br/>No useless apps preinstalled. For those of us that don't use twitter or instagram etc, they aren't installed so you don't have to take up space with stuff you don't want.<br/>Voice recognition is better than the Samsung installed versions<br/>lots of storage<br/>tutorial on how to use the phone<br/>Mayday function is great and works like a charm!!<br/>you can change the order of your apps but not the background color<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Lack of apps with dynamic perspective but that changes quickly<br/>No Google aps but you can add your gmail to the email and it works fine. They have mapquest and it works better than google maps anyway. But it takes getting used to.<br/>No SD card slot. But there is storage online and large storage on the phone, so its not too bad.<br/>cannot categorize your installed aps like you can with Samsung but you can rearrange them<br/><br/>Overall, a great phone. Not perfect but far better than either the iPhone or the Android phones.
What I like (Aug 4 updated review):<br/>1. One of my primary reasons for getting the Fire Phone was the camera and associated unlimited free Amazon Cloud storage for pictures taken with it. Last week, I took the Fire along on vacation to test its camera. The battery lasted a long time and the photos are very good. For example, I took 530 photos at the Chicago Botanic Garden, using about 80% of the battery charge. I shot 350 photos at Chicago's Field Museum, using about 65% of the battery charge. I tire before the Fire's battery does. The pictures are quite good, especially when photographing objects. Landscapes with bright skies tend to be underexposed, but the pictures are easily corrected in photo apps.  I took a lot of pictures, about 1,350 over five days, and they uploaded to the cloud every evening when I had good Wi-Fi connections at hotels or at home. I can now access the pictures on my Kindle, iPad Air and my PC using companion Amazon Cloud apps. The Fire Phone camera isn't going to replace my big Nikon for serious photography, but it's a decent supplement.<br/>2. The Fire Phone is quick and has an excellent display. Maps, including the ability to show "what's around here" restaurants, etc. by tilting the screen are fantastic. I like the 3D potential.<br/>3. Other than photos, my most used apps are for news, weather and mail. My favorite news app, Flipboard with a link to my New York Times account, is fluid. The NY Times also displays beautifully in the Silk browser. I prefer getting and managing my Gmail on the Fire Phone to using the actual Gmail app. There are many good weather apps with the same functionality as my other i-Devices.<br/>4. Phone and text functions work well.<br/>5. I like the free access movies and music albums via Amazon Prime. I'm looking forward to connectivity to the Fire TV unit, which I have ordered.<br/>6. The Fire Phone has a good selection of apps. What I want but can't find at the Amazon store, I'll find on other devices. Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Google all offer great products and software. I use them all and am happy to add the Amazon Fire Phone to the mix.<br/>Minor Cons:<br/>1. There is a little dust between the rear camera lens and the glass back. It doesn't appear to degrade the photos, but I'm annoyed that I can't get at it.<br/>2. There is some incompatibility between the Fire Phone and my car audio. Music streams fine over the blue-tooth connection, but voice directions from a third-party GPS app do not.
Phone is great works better than most smartphones I've had. Great features, it's easy to use and feels great in your hands. The early pre launch reviews had me worried but the phone is a solid entry for Amazon. I love it! Would recommend to anyone.
Such a great smart phone. All of the technology of an IPhone with the user friendliness we all love from Amazon products.My husband (an IPhone guy) and I (a Droid girl) both just got one. We love it so much more than our last few phones!
The battery does not seem to last as long as I am used to,and there is no explanation as to how to close a window on the browser that I can find. But all in all a good phone as well as easy to browse the web with,listen to music as well.
I was really excited when Amazon announced the launch of a phone.  I've been an avid iPhone user and was currently using the 5.  However, with the release of IOS 7 and 8, my phone was not happy and I was looking for new options.  I was very hesitant to try the Fire due to all the negative reviews.  Bottom line, at least for me, is - what do you use your phone for?  I realized I'm a very basic user.  I needed Spotify, audiobooks, email, web access and navigation.  As an avid reader and borrower from the library, I don't like that Overdrive doesn't have certain features.  So far I haven't found an app that I wasn't able to download.<br/><br/>I've been using the Kindle Fire HDX for a while so I'm somewhat familiar with the setup.  I.e. the carousel style home page and navigating around the android software.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm really enjoying this.  Add to it the fact that I was able to get it for $0.99 from AT&T; - plus a year of Prime and it's a good deal.  Yes, I'm locked in for 2 years with AT&T; but it's not the first time I do that. Unfortunately I disabled all the flashy specs that the Fire has such as the dynamic perspective and firefly.  The dynamic made my phone go hot.  VERY HOT.  Plus it used up a lot of battery.  I also wish the camera button wasn't so close to the volume buttons.  There is also no easy way of viewing what songs or audiobooks are playing from the lock screen.  There is a way, just not a very efficient way.<br/><br/>This is a good first try.  I guess if I had actually paid more than a $1 for the phone I would be upset.  I am concerned about the longevity of this phone and hope it makes to the 2-year mark.
As much as I love Amazon and will continue to be a loyal customer, the Fire Phone was a complete disaster.  I'm sad to say that a couple hours ago I logged into my AT&T; account and spent a bunch of money buying an iPhone 6 before my AT&T; Next plan expired.<br/><br/>With as many glitches as this phone has, there hasn't been an O.S. update since December.<br/><br/>All I can think about that is that sales have really flopped and this phone never came anywhere near what we expected.<br/><br/>Really wish this would have gone better. The phone sucks for business professionals.  I hate to say, but I cannot take it anymore.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>I initially gave the Fire Phone 4 stars.  I wish I still could.  I would if the phone phone worked.  However, the phone is glitch laden.  Really, truly glitch laden. My word!  It's horrible at this point and Amazon has not put out an O.S. update since August 8th.  Please, please, please issue an O.S. update to fix all the glitches.  It's horrible and non-usable at this point.<br/><br/>My issues:<br/><br/>1)  Cannot talk outbound unless I have my blue tooth.  I can hear the caller on the other end just fine, but they cannot hear me.  Reported the problem like 3 weeks ago, but still no resolution and supposedly they want to replace my phone, but I've been hearing that for a week and a half now, and still nothing.  Really sick of wearing my blue tooth until 10:00 p.m. every night in case somebody calls.<br/><br/>2)  Freezes.  A lot.  Everything.<br/><br/>3)  Touchscreen.  Often have to touch the screen 10 or 15 times for the screen to work.<br/><br/>4)  Can't open or accept Outlook Calendar invites.  Really, Amazon?  Business professionals on the move rely upon their phone being able to open and accept the standard Outlook Calendar invite.<br/><br/>5)  Hot.  Not just warm, but hot.  Sometimes I have to take the phone out of my business casual pants front pocket because it's burning my leg.  Not tight blue jeans or anything.  Nice loose business pants and my leg is burning.<br/><br/>6)  Battery life.  I think it should be described as battery dead.<br/><br/>I love Amazon and I really want to like this phone.  However, it simply doesn't work.  I can't even talk on my phone.<br/><br/>Amazon, please help.  Please help fast so I don't have to go back to my iPhone.<br/><br/>After having the phone for about 24 hours now, I do think it represents the exact opposite of everything that I've learned to dislike about iOS over the last few years.  As far as I'm concerned, the Fire Phone truly kicks the iPhone's tail end.<br/><br/>My concerns about easily getting my contacts, iTunes music, etc. from my iPhone to the Fire Phone were quickly put to rest.  The process was easy, a couple quick calls to Mayday, and I've just about got everything setup.<br/><br/>The other reviewers are correct, the phone does operate warm.  The battery also seems to consume power about 1/3 quicker than the iPhone 5.  I went to bed last night with a 97% charge on the battery.  I woke up 6 hours later with a 94% charge.  Perhaps with software updates, Amazon can streamline whatever processes are happening in the background that drain the battery quicker than other phones.  A software update may also be able to help with the warmth.<br/><br/>My only other minor complaint is not being able to organize / alphabetize my bookmarks.<br/><br/>The dynamic perspective is cool.  I won't use it a ton, but it will get some use on my phone . . . my kids will love it.  I really like the hand gestures and being able to scroll just by tilting the phone back.<br/><br/>There are plenty of Apps for what I need, and the mail App quickly and easily connected to my corporate IMAP mail server.  The processor is definitely an upgrade for me.  The phone is fast.<br/><br/>Very happy so far.  I would have given 5 starts except for the battery.  But I have a car charger so I'm not worried about not being able to make it through a whole day.<br/><br/>So for all the critics of the last few weeks giving the phone low marks, I think they're all wrong.  I think the phone will do a ton more than just directing people to buy things off of Amazon.com.  Yes, it make Amazon shopping easier, but it's a great phone as well.  Not a perfect phone, but great.<br/><br/>Great job by Amazon on their first release.  It will only get better.
I like the speed and the camera.  It was missing quite a few features at first, and had some serious bugs, but they are releasing new versions of the operating system fast enough to fix those in a reasonable time after I encounter them.
I had vey high expectations for this phone.<br/>However I am vey very disappointed.  I made a big mistake.  Now I am stuck unless I want to pay a high penalty for canceling my account.<br/>When the phone arrive Installed my favorite apps. But Google Hangouts is not available at this time.<br/>My biggest gripe is the in call volume level through the phones speakers. It is almost impossible to hear.  We moved the volume control all the way to the top also.<br/><br/>The volume level seems fine for all the other apps like music and video.  Even the phones ringer is loud. But when you pick up the in call audio is very low.<br/>I called Amazon support and spoke to several people about this issue including people from their wireless phone  department.<br/>We came to the conclusion that I had a defective phone.  They shipped out a second phone.  It has the same exact problem. One of the bloggers suggested I try to switch hearing aid function on.  I did this and there is absolutely no difference<br/>with the  hearing aid function on or off.  I don't think the hearing aid option even works on fire phone using the phone's speaker.<br/>Now I will have to continue to use my old pay as you go phone and use Fire Phone for SNS.<br/><br/>If you wish to hear your phone calls you will need to use the earphones or a Bluetooth speaker .  The phone's speaker is useless. :(<br/><br/>Update. Amazon offered to give me full credit for the Fire phone towards any other phone plus credit my account for the difference..  To prevent the problem with the contact.  They had me keep my Sim card to use with the new phone.<br/><br/>Thank you Amazon for trying to keep me happy.
Where 2 start it's a cool phone no lie buuuuuut how is it possible that you can screen shot but isn't ne where 2 retrieve them......n then app store nuff sed about that jus hope Amazon fixes that on their next phone if they make fire 2
Love it!  So easy to use. I have a Kindle Fire so the format was easier for me than other phones Had some problems getting my contacts from other sources, but the Help people at amazon backed me up and helped me out. Great support.
There are many reasons to not want the firephone. For me it is just to much a gimic with its dynamic perspective the ugly launcher etc. But these shillers got to take their crap elsewhere. This nonsense about amazon using non green energy etc as a reason to not buy this phone is nonsensical at best and these greenpeace fraudsters need to grow up your college days are coming to a end soon. No employer wants idiots like you.<br/><br/>Official greenpeace posting reads as follows.<br/><br/>Do you have an Amazon.com account? Great! Now, take these TWO easy steps to tell Amazon to shape up:<br/><br/>Number 1) Copy the following review (or just write your own):<br/><br/>It’s time to put out the Fire! It makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud is not a strong selling point, especially when competitors like Apple are using 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon can commit to using modern energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.<br/><br/>Number 2) Click HERE to leave a 1-star review on the Amazon Fire Phone product page:<br/>Pssst … don't forget to click "one" star when you paste your review. And you may need to log into your Amazon.com account first before accessing the review page.<br/><br/>Thank you again for taking action. Time and time again we’ve seen that your support makes a big difference in getting companies like Amazon to embrace better policies. As an Amazon.com customer, it’s important they hear from you directly.<br/><br/>For a greener internet and future,<br/><br/>David Pomerantz<br/>Greenpeace USA Senior Energy Campaigner<br/><br/>I do not personally own a firephone and i personally think that it is not worth the money but i have given it 5 stars just to offset the crap from greenwar shills.
I upgraded from an iPhone and I do like this phone a lot. Only downfall is it does not have certain apps available such as snapchat which I miss having. I wish they would get more common apps. Having Amazon prime is awesome though.
Absolutely hate this phone. Screen won't come on half the time, Volume for music and stuff is horrible, not many compatible apps, have to touch things three or more times before it responds. The only thing I like is the Firefly!!!
First smart phone I've ever had and am very pleased.  Especially with the cameras!  Absolutely a breeze to take photos and share them immediately.  All buttons and functions work as expected.  No problems what so ever.
I love this phone it took me a little while to adjust after using Apple for so long ok so some of my games won't work on the fire but the Apple became an iPod for the games that won't work<br/>Apple is dead to me now
It is easy to use for someone that has never owned a smart phone.  There are times with I open things that I can not find a way to close them without shutting the phone down.  Over all I recommend it for everyone.
Very disappointed that there's not an app.  for Bank of America.  I'm still learning about the phone, but it's really nice to have live help when you need it.  I also like that I can read my Kindle books anywhere.
Does a lot of stuff, sensitive, makes not hard to navigate. Prime shows are not to my taste, most are not very popular shows, no wonder they are free. Graphics excellent, photos excellent. Processing seems slow.
The fire phone seemed like it would be a phone that people who like their kindles, yet want a smaller more portable device which also doubles as a phone, would want. Basically a no learning curve experience for kindle owners looking for a phone. So if thats what you are, you may love this phone. If you don't want features or all of the Android marketplace, and you want integrated Amazon features, this is the phone for you. If you're not someone like this, then this phone probably won't satisfy you.. you can't get certain apps such as snap chat or clash of clans without downloading from computer. The 3D perspective begins to get really gimmicky and I've actually turned it off at this point. Firefly is something cool to show your friends, or maybe if you're a book lover, it can come in handy, because that's all it seems to scan well. It feels luxurious, well made. It runs pretty smoothly. It comes with a year of Amazon prime, which can be the most useful thing in the world if you use Amazon a lot. At the price point it's fallen to, I'd just buy one of these evey year instead of paying 90$ a year for prime. Youre paying and extra 20 dollars for a pretty good phone. So honestly in the end, Don't misunderstand my three stars, if I were rating this phone for myself, I'd give it four<br/> stars, but since I know there are a lot of other<br/>Phone choices out there, and many which are smoother, easier, or just faster than this, I decided to rate it three stars.
THIS IS MY HUSBAND PHONE AND IT IS GREAT.  IT IS A REALLY NICE PHONE, I WAS IMPRESSED TOO.  LOVE THE VIRTUAL 3D SCREEN IT HAS AND IT DOES JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE.  AS LONG AS HE'S HAPPY MAKES ME HAPPIER...
I LOVE MY FIRE PHONE. I have had no problems with it and it has had great battery life compared to my Galaxy 3 phone. Need to get another charger for the house. Other than that, I would recommend it highly.
I read all the review, watched the video how-to's on YouTube, and researched this phone so I knew what I was buying.  I have to say, it is what i wanted.  Now, just to wait out my 2 years of ATT service!
excellent phone, i love it...
this is by far one of the best phones i have owned many androids, the only limit to the phone is with some apps but when you get a phone that charges fast, doesn't lock up its well worth it.
I like the fire has allot of new features that allow you  to. E excited about having a device. Google play would be nice to access my accounts without have to do allot of redundant actions,
It met all expectations. Some of the negatives I read such as battery life problems and such have not been true. The only negative is that some apps aren't available such as my bank's app.
I've had my phone for about a month now.  If you like your Kindle you'll love the Fire phone!  I went from a flip phone to this one and I'm in my 50's.  if I can operate this, anyone can.
Nice phone, takes great photos. Beautiful display. Too much going on on the screen all the time for me. Still learning to maneuver around. I'm cutting off more calls than l'm answering.
Easy, intuitive interface.
I wanted a total friendly user phone and this is it! Also the 3D screen savers/apps is super cool. Also being able to speak with someone live when you have a question is super awesome!
Awesome phone. Previously owned iPhones but to me this one is nicer. Simple and reliable. Much cheaper than the big name phones. A hidden gem in the phone market to say the least.
Like it a lot, but would like to see more apps available.  Have run into a couple I could have used that are not available.  For instance, Hobby Lobby coupon app and Anthem BC/BS app.
The IPhone is the only phone that had been simple enough for me to work, but the Amazon Fire is simple to work and works great.  I use my phone mostly for business and so far so good
I live my fire phone! It is so handy. Especially the one handed features, I just had a baby and being able to navigate my phone one handed and easily access the camera is great.
You will really love this phone technology is out of this world.<br/>Pictures are so beautiful.assistance help is like having a smart tv<br/>But it is a very good smartphone
It's the best phone I have had so far.  I love the large numbers for dialing, the phone is very good operationally, it has an excellent keyboard, overall my phone is user friendly!
I am a huge Amazon fan and I really wanted to like this phone. I went from using an iPhone 5 and didn't want to wait for the iPhone 6. However, after several months with the Fire Phone.  I am really disappointed and wish that I had returned it within the allowable time - or better still, waited for the iPhone 6.<br/><br/>So many others have already listed the pros and cons of the Fire Phone, so no need for me to belabor them and waste anyone's time.  So HERE IS WHAT I HATE MOST!!!<br/><br/>  *  8 hours standby time, then it's nearly dead.<br/>  *  don't let me have a 20 minute phone call. It's pretty much done.<br/>  *  If I use it as a GPS, I will need to have it charging in my car or I won't make it to my destination.<br/>  *  Gets really HOT just sitting - even hotter when charging.<br/><br/>The 3D screen is a cute gimmick that does not make up for all of the negatives.<br/><br/>If you are thinking about buying a Fire Phone, you will want to read all of the one-star reviews first. There is a good reason for that. I am not sure who wrote 5-star reviews. I love you Amazon, Love my Kindles (I've bought just about all of them at least once).  But, your Fire Phone breaks my heart.
I love my fire phone, easier to use for me than any other.  Comfortable to hold and battery holds up well.  Camera is great for a phone.  Wish I could get another for my husband.
I switched from a clunky cell phone to Amazon's smartphone -- the first I've ever owned. I don't use all the features (just texting, talk, and email), so my satisfaction is probably no different than I'd feel about any smartphone.<br/><br/>Firefly is more trouble than it's worth, dynamic perspective is okay but not a big deal, and Mayday rocks. It got me through the first few days whenever I had a question or problem. Because my usage is so limited, I get two or three days on a single charge and I never run out of power. The lowest I've let the battery get is 50%. Another reason why I can go so long between charges? I turned off the power-devouring features like location and weather.<br/><br/>AT&T;'s service has been excellent. I had some issues with the signal at first, but their tech support fixed that. They followed-up a few days later to make sure everything was still working okay. Although I bought the phone from Amazon (full price), I took it to an AT&T; store to get it set up and registered. The service there was also outstanding.<br/><br/>The phone showed lots of fingerprints till I got the screen guard. Now, no more prints.<br/><br/>Dictation for texting gives some pretty funny results, but it's still easier than using the keyboard.
A neat spin on the modern smartphone. The app store is a little lack luster but the free year of prime and daily deals through amazon definitely makes up for that in my opinion.
So far I love my phone  !! I am still learning .  The bonus of Amazon Prime ,was a great surprise.! Planing more surprises to find . Hope everyone  enjoys theirs like I do mine!
Its a cool phone but it lacks the voice for navigation while driving in a city or town I don't know, as well as traffic or more alternative routes when traffic becomes congested
Best phone I have ever had! Easy to use with many amazing features. I love having Firefly at the push of a button! I can't wait to see what Amazon will do with their next phone!
So I'm a SmartPhone Neophyte.  Never had one before and have always been too nervous to hold one in my hands before my Amazon Fire landed on my door step on Thursday.  I had read everything I could and I felt like I could "turn on the phone".  People asked me questions and most, I could answer but a few blew me away but there, I had "Mayday"!  My phone had an "App for that"!  For questions related to service, ATT was great!  (I spoke to Dottie who laughed at my nervousness and helped me so reassuringly!)  Mayday helped me with my battery question and Firefly has helped me figure out those "WTF" things that came about.<br/>I cannot say how much I love my new gadget!  I did my homework and it's paying off!  Maybe because I have nothing to compare it to but this is doing everything I need and more!  Last year I plunged into Amazon with a Kindle Fire and I'm thrilled my Amazon Fire Phone synched with my Kindle Fire to make life so easy for me!
I've had the phone for a couple weeks now but it isn't my primary phone. I love the screen so far it's a great phone no problems making or receiving calls or text.
This is the smartest phone I have had, but it does have lots of things that appeal to the ardent Amazon fan only.  Don't get me wrong: I love Amazon, but I don't need a phone that ties me into shopping online.  I needed a phone that provided me with easy communication for conversations, texting and news.  Forget the games, Kindle, app stores and the ever-present Amazon shopping cart.  The phone doesn't hold a charge.  One conversation can use up 3% of the battery.  The storage seems to be gobbled up by the pre-loaded apps.<br/><br/>AT&T; has been great so far.  Their online help was actually helpl.  When I needed to talk to a live person, they were great and very friendly.  I have to admit I was seduced by the Mayday app on the Fire phone, which has nothing to do with AT&T.;  It's a nice idea, but the reps don't really want to help.  The Mayday app does connect to a live body, but they usually can't help and direct you to upgrades or tell you the reception is no good, call later.<br/><br/>That's my very short review.  I am still getting to know my Fire phone and its very unique personality.
Love amazon, but I have had pure trouble the entire time I have had it. I don't get text messages or phone calls, the only good thing...the lock screen pictures
Very heavy hitting learning curve, but once you learn the features it becomes very intuitive. Only thing preventing 5 star is there is no Google or YouTube app.
I've had the Fire phone for about two weeks now and feel like I can give a fairly reasoned review on the phone. I think its great but the app store is 98% junk, and of what is left most of that is glitchy and buggy. You CANNOT download apps from The Google Play Store. No X-Box music app and I think this is due to Amazons heavy push on its Music Store, that is not a Monthly Service but a Pay For site like I-Music. What music they offer for free via Prime is a joke. Best off downloading your music straight to the phone and forget about streaming. Games well what can I say, most suck, some work--kinda, the rest try to trick you into buying something. Hopefully with feedback this app thing will improve. To note, the basic everyday apps like Facebook and Yelp work flawlessly and in some cases better than on any prior device I've owned. A pet peeve of mine is not being able to personalize my phone and there are very little personalization features on this phone whatsoever, in fact your phone will look pretty much exactly like everyone's, outside of a choice of a few colored cases.
I love this phone.  I purchased it for my 11 year old, and of course he loves it.  I will be purchasing another one for me.  Works great not one issue with it.
I love this phone I love every thing about Amazon I would recommend it to anyone it's a very unique device I love it I<br/>Would rate 100 stars if I could :)
Purchased 2 Amazon fire phones on November 7th 2014,one phone no issues mayday couldn't handle, 2nd fire phone had issues from the start. After about 7-8 months the wife finally had enough and sever mayday documented issues they replaced her phone with a refurbished phone. Lasted about 3 months and same issues reappear. Several documented mayday issues, we went to replace the phone again.....oooops...2 weeks past the original warranty the phone is past its warranty. I being  apparently simple minded said it was just replaced less than 3-4 months ago and asked to speak to a supervisor. I got the supervisor, long story short, basically I'm hosed. I asked you mean to tell me if the original phone was replaced at the 11month Mark, the new replacement phone is only warranted for 30 days totalling 1 yr?....I was dumb enough to think when the new phone arrived I got a new 1yr warranty. Phones are ok as long as they are under warranty......Buyers beware....as a longtime prime member I though it would be different......Will not purchase again and do not recommend either.
Environmental hazard! This phone runs on dirty energy. Stay far far away from it.
I am a loyal and avid Amazon fan and pre-ordered the phone. I have been very disappointed. Unlike all the other Amazon electronics I have owned the phone does not live up to its marketing nor my expectations. I have experienced disappearing contacts when on the phone. The Mayday person I have worked has never owned a smart phone so he was lacking on the ability to understand what my expectations were or what I was talking about. The battery life is worse than any smart phone I have ever owned. I think the apps must stay open and are running the battery down. The Mayday tech said there is no app for shutting them down. I have also had several difficulties with AT&T; trying to get things like the phone's hot spot to work and getting the visual voice mail to work. The AT&T; visual voice mail app was not loaded nor in the Amazon app store. I don't think I can recommend the phone at this time. Jeff Bezo says we do the hard things every time - not this time. Sorry Jeff.
I have had my fire phone for almost a year now and I love it. Got my mom one and when I wanted to get my hubby one there on hold. Best phone I have ever had.
I love my Amazon Fire Phone. Kindle books, movies and all the other features. It is a great phone. I highly recommend this phone. It is well worth the money.
I decided to get a Fire phone because I am both a Prime user and a Kindle user and in general I really love Amazon. When I got the phone I was disappointed to see that I could not get very common apps that I would have liked to have on my phone (Target Cartwheel and Snapchat? REALLY?). I chalked it up to this being a new phone and that hopefully one day those apps would be available. So the other day Amazon announces that they have a new feature for Prime Members- Amazon Stations which I was super excited about to be able to use at the gym. Guess what? IT ISN'T SUPPORTED BY THIS DEVICE! Really? A device made by Amazon doesn't support an Amazon feature? This phone has been one disappointment after another. I would not recommend it to anyone. It does have some decent features (Prime delivery notifcations, ease of use for buying things via Amazon or Kindle) but it is just lacking severely in so many areas. Amazon, I love you, PLEASE make this phone a more desirable option for smart phone users!
This phone is very captivating, and Amazon almost got this phone right.<br/>Pros:<br/>Display, self adjusting awesomeness.<br/>Tilt menus, fluid.<br/>Menus, very readable.<br/>Carousel, neat album art concept for your apps/books.<br/>Size and appearance, sleek, slim, comfortable.<br/>Camera, pretty clear, color accurate, and quick snapshots.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Simple features just are not supported.<br/>Wallpapers/Lockscreens, you get what you're given...(People mention workarounds are buggy.)<br/>Disable 4G Bands, not an option.<br/>Carousel, adds everything you click on everytime you click on it...(This means you can't refine your home screen without sideloading.)<br/><br/>Suggestions:<br/>Amazon needs to let users decide how -their- phone appears. Starting with a wallpaper control. Followed by adding an option to lock the carousel without sideloading an alternate application. Other fairly niche options should exists.
I tried to like it... Im tired of apple and its mass marketed phone, that has practically no innovative features.. it feels like the Iphone is virtually the same phone since its release.... I dont like Android because since there are many flavors of it and many many manufacturers of the phone, the OS is doomed to crash eventually on almost every phone.... I liked the idea of the fire phone because it closely resembles the Apple philosophy: one company that makes the hardware and the software...based on that Idea I wanted to switch from iOS to Amazon OS.<br/><br/>I had the chance to play with a fire phone for a couple of days and I was convinced that Amazon released it before its time... there is much more to improve on the OS side... I think that the hardware part is ok, but the OS part I can only describe it as a castrated version of android OS....much like the HP WebOS... its not bad but has a lot of room for improvement.<br/><br/>I would suggest you try one before you buy one.
Although there's still a lot of things to figure out - and I definitely needed the tutorial and user guide book- I'm overall very happy with the phone. It's got some great features but requires a lot of playing around to figure them out, mostly accidentally or (again) referring to the purchase guide book. My only big complaints are the lack of apps (especially my mobile banking one which isn't compatible with Kindle), and some internet compatibility issues (my work email-I can only read emails, not reply).<br/><br/>A word of warning: if you purchase the phone through the promotional deal with AT&T;, be advised they don't seem motivated to move these phones. I was  repeatedly tried to have my mind changed to a different model and the sales team completely screwed my promo plan up. It required a month of fighting with AT&T; to get everything taken care of. Thankfully, Amazon fixed a portion of the problem for me with one simple email.<br/><br/>My hope is that Amazon will continue to update the operating system as time goes on and set of just giving up on the phone altogether.
For a starter smartphone, it's alright. Simple; easy to use, and the 3d like effect created by the four cameras is a nice feature that's fun to show all your friends, but everyday use, it's a bit unresponsive. But when it works, it's really convenient. If this wasn't my first smart phone, I'd give it a more damming review, but seeing how this is a huge step up from my previous phone (whose maximum capabilities were to show me what time it would be in Budapest) I am somewhat biased. The two stars to be subtracted from an otherwise perfect score come from the paltry app store, and the faulty charger port. To elaborate, the cable often slides out of the port, forcing me to babysit the phone as ity charges. Also, the battery life is not great. Under heavy use, I can go from 100 percent to thirty within three hours, and oddly enough just using it as a morning alarm takes away a tenth of its life! But bottom line, it does what I want it to do; it's useful; comes with great extras (prime for a year, not to mention instant video); and no kidding, comes with wonderful lock screens.
I have been using it for more than a week and I love it! It is very responsive and the new user interface gestures make it very easy to access often used functionality. It is light weight, easy to carry and the screen is large enough to review small documents. Automatic backups work great. I did not even notice them till I looked at my CloudDrive. Applications like Prime Instant Video and Netflix work great since there is enough processing and graphics power in the device. The typing is a lot easier than other android devices I have used, in some ways it is better than the iOS devices.<br/><br/>Couple of minor glitches I have seen are in the applications. On the Facebook app if you try to add a photo, it is easy to get to a point where you simply do not know how to cancel and come back to Facebook without posting the photo. I am sure these glitches will be fixed in software updates sure to follow in the next few weeks. Overall a great buy for me. I am loving it!
Not a techie much myself but the deal was unbeatable and the techies I know all approve of the phone. In fact they are jealous of some of the features.
Works well, fairly intuitive.  Nice for reading Kindle books.  Prime music is really nice.<br/>Can't get google play apps, this is a bit of a problem.
IT IS AWESOME, I AM LEARNING THE BASICS AND MAYDAY IS MY FAVORITE. BEING 60+ IS GREAT AND HAVING HELP WITH THE NEW TECHNOLOGY OF A PHONE IS👍👍.Thanks
The phone overall is great, the only thing I would like to see more of is apps. The phone is sleek, fast and has a learning curve but is easy to use.
I have always been a apple girl . But I wanted something different and I fell in love with the fire . I Am so glad I got the phone . Good job Amazon.
so I have jad my phone for almost a.month and of course I was excited to get it ! and I love my phone so much. <3 I mean.im.stuck with it for the next two years so.I suppose.I.ought.to lol. but anyway, its awesome. the navigation took a while to figure out but if your on facebook and you cant get off a picture you click drag you finger from the right bottom corner to the top.left corner and ive been doing that for whenever I get stuck.on a screen and its been.navigating like a charm. im still getting used to this.large key board but the phone is great. I love the camera.<3 and.my battery lasts for freaking ever. I can go to.work on a.10 hr shift on 49% and walk.out either high 30s or.at 40% so its been.like perfect and it hasnt died yet and.im always forgetting a charger. I love my mew phone. I just wish I.has.snapchat lol. but if fits nice in.my hands its ad tall as a.galaxsy s4 just not as wide which is good for tight.pockets.
It's a great phone, I bought the unlocked phone and I have my old provider with no contract. I can do everything with it that I do with my Kindle HD
Love it, syncs with my kindle. Only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is because, I'm still learning how to use it. This is a very tech savvy phone.
I wish the apps that come with the Fire phone would be more robust. Like the Music app, it doesn't even feature an equalizer or any other of the music player free apps. Also, Maps does not have any Bicycle routes? Google maps has it! Basically I have to get on the browser and use Google maps when I am searching for bicycle paths or routes on a map, kinda sad really, since I enjoy the looks of the Fire phone and the Fire OS itself I think It has lot of potential but it is not quite there yet, in comparison with the biggest two OS; IOS & Android. Moreover, I would recommend to go to a store and see how it feels before you buy it since in my opinion is a little heavier than the rest of the phones out there.<br/><br/>If you're into apps, do not go for this phone. If you are looking for a phone that is not the same phone that everyone else has and that performs well, looks good and discrete. Please then go for the Amazon Fire phone.
the phone gets too hot when you turn the dynamics sensor on, the speaker doesn't sound good, they barely have apps in the amazon app store.
Just not fair comparing the iphone 5 to the fire phone 1. Text size adjustment and a button lock added, I would have no complaints. Great HDR pics.
Very good phone. Glad that Amazon drop the price.Customer service is awesome. battery issue is something they need to check about.
All these years, I've watched the rise of cell phone technology as it exploded into what it is today, but I could never afford one until recently, and wouldn't have been able to make a choice from the thousands on the market anyway.<br/>When I saw that this Fire Phone was being offered for just 99¢ (with the 2-year contract), I figured that now would be the best time to jump into the fray, considering my love of ordering from Amazon!<br/>Couldn't believe how quick and painless the whole process was, and it arrived in two days, with all the set-up already programmed into it!<br/>In the week I've had it, there've been no difficulties, just a whole lot of fun exploring its capabilities as I load up on all the coolest free (or at least cheap) apps I can find! This thing is like the ultimate Swiss Army Knife, and I predict all manner of improvements to my lifestyle, now that I'm officially a member of the 21st century.
Worst phone I ever owned, lots of room for improvement on this one,  I've had it for a few months now so hopefully their next one will be better!
I absolutely love this phone!  Nice big screen, easy to handle, all the options I want and then some.  It has more than I have had time to learn!
The Amazon Fire is awesome!!! Best smart phone I've ever owned and trust me I've owned them all.. including the i-phone 6 which I broke in 3 days
My 15yr old loves it
Sweet phone love the tilt features and the graphics and games are awesome and of course prime is a nice little bonus as well as the audio books
Really nice phone I love the wallpaper changing everyday I would highly recommend this phone to everyone who is thinking about changing phones.
Phone is easy to use, however very limited with customizing. Hoping they start getting more apps. Frustrating they are missing very basic apps.
I am a supporter of Kindles and thought I'd give the phone a try.  Love the size & weight of the phone.  Anti glare no bubble screeen protector has been great.  But, the technology is still not there on the phone.  I've given it a month.  Love the camera but dislike the fact photos can't be categorized for easy find.  Tried to use the calendar and found everything was posted to facebook with no way to delete the posting.  Called Mayday and was told the calendar only work in conjunction with facebook or twitter.  I rely heavily on my phone calendar, no that feature is lost to me.  Wasn't able to access apps I had on my old phone, most especially the weather alerts from the local tv station.  Mayday technicians don't have the knowledge to correct all problems.  The battery life is poor.  The phone gets so hot, it has to be put down or turned off...I worry about combustion and starting a fire.  The USB cord that was provided was split with wires exposed.
Have had phone for two weeks, so far I like this phone. Easy to use, slim , fits into purse nicely. Learning more about it daily daily.
Don"t by this phone if you want to use it as a real phone.  The phone features like the calendar, contact list, the voice regonition and the availability of apps are really lacking.  If you want to use the "find my phone" feature, you have to sign into your Amazon account via a browser, unlike Apple, all you have to do is to login to a free app on the phone. Buy this phone if all you want to do is purchase music, apps (if you search for an app, instead of telling you it is not available, amazon give you a list of other apps most of them are not related to the one you want to buy, maybe they hope you will buy them anyway), movies and play games.  The take away is wait for the Iphone 6.
I love this phone.
Best phone ever. I love it. I am glad to be part of the Amazon echo system. Now I am planning to buy the Echo and the fire tablet.
I love this phone. After I figured out how to turn off a few apps my battery life is 2.5 days....AWESOME!!! It's very easy to use.
I received the phone on time. It has some features that take some getting used to, but all in all I am satisfied with the purchase
The Amazon Fire Phone is unique in every aspect and brings a completely new feel into the world of smart phones. I saw the phone for the first time in an ad online and I immediately drawn to it, all of the features including fire fly and mayday are extremely helpful and convenient for everyday use. Although the Fire OS was a bit difficult to get used to being a previous IPhone owner I now enjoy a lot more than was expected. This phone.is remarkable and I don't plan on switching phones anytime soon in fact I might just wait for Amazon to take all of these current ideas and features and make the second phone one day to once again blow everybody's mind with their unique approach in the mobile world of tablets and smartphones. Thank you Amazon, By the way throwing in a free year of Prime ? AWESOME !
I heard a lot of good things bout this phone. So I ordered it, I absolutely love it. I recommend the Amazon fire phone to anyone.
I think this phone is great!!  I own a kindle fire so my adaption to this phone was smooth.  Recommending this to all my friends.
My first Smart Phone, and I Love it. Voice quality is clear, wifi hookup is very good, and oh the 4g service Excellent thus far.
wow I have compared this to both the I phones an the Galaxys. FOR THE MONEY IT IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST i LOVE THE WAY ITS SET UP.
The Amazon phone is easy to use and has got a lot of fun and useful apps I really enjoy the Amazon phone.I give it two thumbs up
I still have yet to understand why there are so many terrible reviews on this phone, I only purchased it went it was selling ultra cheap because I was so discouraged by all the bad reviews.  I must say that I'm very happy that I did eventually take a leap of faith and purchase it on Ebay... as its one of the best user interface hands down on a phone I've owned prior. I have had every single iPhone from the first generation up to the 6 and I prefer this phone overall. The screen is bold with great vibrant color and depth. Icons are super cool and very life like. My pet peeve like a lot of other folks is disappointment that the phone doesn't  play too nice with the google store but considering I love everything else about the phone I could live with the limited app sellections.  It seems as if amazon has now discontinued the fire phone, I just hope they will continue to support it with future updates.
Got the phone in the mail the 18th from amazon in the mail, that day had to go to at&t; store. Phone would not pick up 4G network, they had to replace the Sim card to fix the issue. The 24th the phone would not charge, did the mayday thing and was told to hard boot it. Didn't work, went to at&t; store and found out the charge cable quit working. They gave me a new and better one for free! Today the 25th having issues with the ear buds, they will not advanced to the next track, volume and pause work fine, they work sometimes on my kendle HD tablet. They work fine on my Samsung 4 tablet, go figure! Guess it is time to mayday again, or just buy something of better quality that is compatible  with his phone. I am trying  to love you fire phone, but you are being a butthead! Besides those issues, the apps and speed of the phone is great!
Over complicated negotiations to screens. Went from a google nexus to this phone. Big change. In programming there are 8 steps max for everything. To make a phone call or look up a contact you have 7-8 screen taps.  (If driving or multitasking; not a good thing) Programming is poor and not thought out. I feel Amazon must have rushed the developers of the OS because they made it work but NOT efficient.<br/><br/>No I can buy baby daipers with incredible efficiency and have them deliver half way across the world within a day!!! Amazon, Really??@!!! your great just fire everyone who worked this and start over. Maybe just write a check to the 5 best mobile developers and get them on your team.<br/><br/>I bought a $24.00 Samsung Galaxy Prime Core. Better phone.<br/><br/>Of course you get the prime and the mayday services WHICH IS AWESOME but you lose all the nice designed user oriented smart phone.
Good Cell phone but needs include a good manual. I redesign the central navigation key. The opcion Esc for close aplications.
I love this phone. It has so many features. It's easy to use. Battery time is long. Prime is a great bonus! Highly recommend.
The phone is ok but I don't think I would get it again it freezes up<br/>I am not happy with the Amazon fire phone
I love the features on the phone, but I was disppointed that I was not able to get some of the apps that I had on my iphone.
Still trying to learn how to do everything on it.  It would be nice if you got a book with it to tell you how to do things.
I can text friends and they receive but when they respond I never get it. They end calling to see why I don't respond back.
had some technical diffuculties at first, but like it now.  Miss some of my Iphone Apps, though
After 2 months, I can finally say I LOVE MY PHONE. Last update dropped my voicemail notice - BRING IT BACK TO GET 5 STARS!
Ok, This is the first high tech phone I have ever had. My last phone was a Verizon flip top with no texting, calls only. I have had a great experience so far. the switch over was automatic and worked easily, the customer service was awesome and mayday is awesome used it several times the first night...I love the way the phone feels and functions very smooth and easy to learn. Tons of Apps , I just keep finding, most are free!!! Wow this is a great first time phone. I used the texting and love the intuitive text feature it has, do they all? works great! the cool 3d look in the screen is amazing and clear...firefly is soooo cool also, lots to love!!! nothing bad here so far....
I like the phone. But not being able to get some of the apps. Other phones can get is a bummer. But great phone over all.
I am still learning to use it...it takes an 83 year old who never had a smart phone a little while to learn new gadgets.
I love this phone. I am so glad I got it. It does so much and I love having amazon at my finger tips. Love love love....
I should preface my review by saying that I am a first time smart phone user that is heavily invested in the Amazon enviroment.  I have a Kindle and all of my children have them as well.  I love this phone.  All of my apps, games, books, and music were right there out of the box.  I am also able to administrate content for the children's devices from my phone.  The camera is excellent, the display is gorgeous, and it has tons of space.<br/>Cost was another big plus.  A year of free Prime brought my price down to $70 for an unlocked smart phone.  The only negative thing for me is the battery life which is why I gave it four stars.  It drains very quickly especially when using dynamic perspective.  I leave it off most of the time which helps some.  Over all a great purchase, but it appears not to matter since the Fire Phone is no longer available.
I love the Amazon Fire Phone! The only problem I have is that the app selection is very small. Simple apps like Snapchat, Yik Yak, etc. I also hate how they don't have an Atlanta Marta app that works. The original one is on iphones and on the Google Play store. I also don't like that you can't download Google Chrome because Bing is not a good search browser.<br/><br/>Other than the app issues, the GPS works extremely well. However there isn't an option for you to choose the route you take to a place. On other androids and iPhones, the GPS give you 2 or 3 different routes you can choose from. When it shows all of the routes, you can also see which route will not lead you into traffic. The Amazon Fire Phone shows you traffic but it will still lead you into it.<br/><br/>Other than those two problems, I love my phone and show it off all the time!
Great phone!!! Love it!!!! has everything that I wanted and user friendly.<br/>Big plus is Amazons customer service.
Love! Love! Love my new phone! I've been a die hard iPhone fan since the beginning but their growth has really stunted recently and with each new iPhone I didn't notice much difference. At the same time My husband switched to the galaxy S4. It was a lot tougher for him to make the transition as the phones are so different but the fire phone is like a hybrid of the iPhone and droid so it's features are an even mix of the two. It's literally as if iPhone and droid had a baby. Anyway, I love the 3D features and the camera is awesome. I guess my only issue is there are not as many apps as the iPhone but I'm guessing they will get there soon.
I love the phone, but it may be more than I can afford.  The charges for everything is adding up.
Love this phone.
I have had my Fire Phone for a year now, I waited to review it because I wanted to get to know it a little better. Overall it has been a great phone for me. There have been a couple of small problems: 1 when i put it on vibrate it doesn't always stay on vibrate. 2. I have accidentally called people just by picking up my phone. The only feature that I don't care for is the swipe up to go back so page when browsing, I like to read articles and many of them require sliding the text upward to read the next part I can't tell toughie frustrating it is to get most if the way through an item and accidentally swipe back to the previous page. I love that I can sync it to my Kindle Fire so that I can read and listen to books continuously on both devices. I have enjoyed the ease of operating this phone. I would definitely purchase the next one.
I am thrilled with my new Fire phone!  Never having a smartphone before I wasn't sure what to expect.  I do have the Kindle Fire HD & just love the 7-inch size - so I was sure that the new Fire phone would have all of the same great features I find on the Fire HD tablet.  I'm still exploring this new phone - the only problem has been the setup between Amazon & AT&T.;  Since I am a senior & do have some disabilities - it was a problem - but the nice people at AT&T; walked me through the connection process, since I wanted to keep my old cell phone number but disengage from Verizon.  Also - I would like to suggest you show more of the very interesting "screen saver" pictures which appear when the phone is first turned on.  These are beautiful & imaginative!
I love this phone it is so excited that I came learn it all but I am doing my best. Fantastic phone, Fantastic!!!!!!
This is my first smartphone.It is a little difficult to navigate at first but everything seems to be working well..
I'm going to give a review of the actual phone. People please stop reviewing the energy policies of Amazon...this is not the place. I had an iPhone for years and the only thing I liked better about it was the app selection and the emojis (I miss the smiley faces). I would give this phone 5 stars if I could get my banks apps and a few others I miss, and my smiley. Personally, I don't know why the iPhone is so great. Their energy policies are wonderful and I applaud them, but like I said, this is not the forum, and these people writing bad posts could be paid, the same person posting with fake names, or could be from Apple that are trying to lower Amazon's Fire ratings. I truly hope not, but it's an obvious effort by the cut and paste posts with only a few things changed on each one. Shame of you people. Loving my Fire phone!
The phone is like a upgrade of a smart phone but the only problem I can't download a few apps that Google play has
I really don't like this phone. Can't get the apps I want. Easily can damage tge bach falls apart. Glitches alot.
It has a few glitches sometimes especially when pressing the home button when it's locked. So far pretty pleased!
I love this phone! This is the first such device I have ever purchased, and I recommend it to anyone who might be challenged by some of the new technology available to consumers. Easy to use and navigate, one of the best features on this device is the phone. The buttons are larger and make it easier to use. The text feature is also great, and almost types the words itself. Amazon, and its partner with this device, AT&T;, have a wonderful duo to help consumers stay more connected than ever. GREAT JOB.
So far, I love this phone! It has all kinds of cool options and features, is SO easy to use one handed, and the screen is AMAZING! It's almost the perfect device except for one tiny thing.. There aren't any timestamps on the texts so if, I miss one, I can't tell how long ago it was received. I cringe thinking I've upset people by ignoring them for who knows how long, because I haven't been paying attention, even if it turns out to only be minutes. That's probably silly and just me, though so I'm still giving it Five BIG Stars! Thank You Amazon!
I had a problem initially. Had to contact my server to get it going. After that I believe that I like it a lot.
My daughter helped me a lot. Once I learned the phone it is great. It has more things on it than other phones..
Hopefully Amazon will make it back to its customers who believed in that phone and paid a lor of money for it.
Love my Fire Phone!  It is actually the first smartphone I have owned and I can say that I would buy it again.
I love my phone
Love this phone
Loving it a lot
Excellent phone
Love the fact that Amazon uses the fuel of their choice and do not give to public pressure and the liberals of America. Keep up the great work.
Not much to say another home run by Amazon for me. My house is a fire city zone.
I love my Amazon Fire Phone, it has so many features on it I have never seen with other smart phones, and this 13 MP camera? There are no words for how wonderful it is. This phone is fast. And it works with Straight Talk, which I was highly pleased to find out. Also works with T- Mobile as well.  The only thing right now is, I just got this phone Monday and knew automatically it needed a case for it and a screen protector, and the very day I was coming home to it, the phone dropped and the screen shattered, but I am going to get the screen repaired soon. I was going to buy another, but they are out of stock oh well. Please come back into stock with this phone Amazon! It was really wonderfully priced!!!
I enjoy my fire phone immensely.  The phone is built for hard use. I like that the screen is not the size of a tablet.  I was skeptical at first but yet I did not want to buy another Samsung with its huge screen and content that finds itself on another Android phone .<br/>Because Fire's OS is different, I find that there is more privacy and no unwanted file sharing with every other galaxy in the room.<br/>Take a look at phone and you might like it as I did.  The sound is fantastic( I listen to a lot of audio books) The phone and all its trimmings performs better than other smart phones I have had.<br/>The phone is indestructible.
I have tried and tried to get support to help with several problems.  I call get someone, they refer me to someone else, they put me on hold and then end the call and have the nerve to send me an auto survey "How did we DO?"<br/><br/>I have not been able to take decent pictures since the first month I have had the phone.  I know there must be something wrong with the aperture but not one tech person ever suggests this, they just want to refer me on....  I can take pictures turning the phone around, but not with the screen towards me.<br/><br/>Also, the button to turn the phone off has disappeared into the phone and only can be accessed by poking a pen or some other object into the phone.
I love the Fire Phone. I love how the screen moves with your face and the little games that come with it. I love how I was able to download my music on to the phone without any problems. The Mayday button is very useful, they helped me download my work documents onto my phone from my computer with no problem what so ever. I like how I can go straight to the amazon store to buy the baby supplies that I need with out having to go to my computer. Its very different from using the iPhone, but I enjoy it. Its something new and, in my opinion, is a lot better than the iPhone.
I love my Amazon Fire phone. Best thing is I can take as many pictures and videos I want with good quality.
Has been less than 2 weeks since purchase but this phone has performed better than I ever thought it could.
all the EQULIZER APPS do not work on this phone. I cannot see the screen its got the same problems as the Motorola Zoom Tablet. out side light will black out the screen,. also media player apps that got Equalizers on it. well the EQ  on it dose not work. there is no Micro SD slot because HOLLYWOOD bitched about pirate movies on people making copies of it.. That kills sales on Micro SD cards causing prices to go up. and also put people who make MICRO SD cards out of business. . and these people who make MICRO SD CARDS, SD CARDS and what not is doing a honest job so we can use our cameras Better off trying to get a Samsung phone. a Samsung phone is not international or unlocked. at least there is a Micro SD slot and there is a stronger chance to find a EQUALIZER to work,
I love this phone the only issue that I have with it is the calendar has to be linked to an email address.
I have been using this phone since from more than 10 months, last week when I did benchmark on Antutu, PC Mark and Vellamo (Qualcom's) from Google play, I realise the power of phone, however it has never shown slowness so far. Really it still beats Samsung Galaxy S6 and Note 4 which are top in his list for Single Thread Integer and Floating point instruction. This is the best and most premium phone, premium hardware is used. More you use it, more you will be in love with it. One thing to add which is personal, as I have got habit of Carousel, I never feel comfortable in using any of Andoid L or M or any other launcher, tried most of best launchers, still they cannot compete Carousel view usage if you get use to it, In fact it provide you the best way to use it.
this is our first ever smart phone.  We are very pleased.  However, the  battery charge life seems short.
It is a awesome phone and I really love mayday cause I can't work nothing so it helps meðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–
I love, love, love it!!! Still finding things to do.. I'm very happy with my decision on this product...
love my new phone, I haven't learned everything yet and may not. It does a lot more things than I need.
My only wish is that I could either use Google Play apps or have more apps added to the Fire App Store.
On Paper, this phone looks really impressive... Here is the Breakdown:<br/><br/>The Good: - Impressive resolution and 3D display<br/>  - Firefly Technology is Great<br/>  - 13MP HD Camera, Provides high quality picture and video; with software editing built in.<br/>  - Long Battery Life: Provides 22 Hours of talk time, 285 hours of standby, and 11 hours of video viewing & playback<br/>  - 1 free year of Amazon Prime<br/><br/>The Bad:  - Availability of Aps is extremely Staggering!!<br/>  - Ease- of -Navigation takes some time to learn, and leaves much to be desired.<br/>  - Wireless browsing with Silkbrowser tends to lag and leave unreasponsive pages.
I like the phone but don't like the fact that many apps aren't available like with Android and iPhone.
Very nice phone. Graphic games and everything is else just wish it was kinda like android with Google.
I love it is easy to use is like the kindle but you also can talk, and have everything in it, is great
The phone itself is fine, but I find it very difficult to get apps on the Amazon app store.
I absolutely love my fire phone, it had everything I was looking for, great camera and great storage.
I love this phone. Very easy to operate. The photos come out so bright. Won't trade it for any other.
I love my Fire Phone.  It is easy to use and has many great features. I would recommend it to anyone.
I like having the designated button for the camera so I can take pictures easily and quickly when I want.  I've never had an iPhone or any of the Samsung phones so can't compare the quality of pictures.  I do like the quality of the pictures I have taken.  I also like the voice feature, but wish it would function better.  This feature seems to "have a problem" too often and I like using it if I'm driving so I can read or send a text without typing.  Actually, I use this feature a lot when I'm not driving.  I find it easier than typing on the face of the phone...I prefer a phone with a keyboard.  I'm waiting for an upgrade on this feature so it will do more and function better.  Overall...I really like my new Fire Phone.
Love it what I was expecting the apps could be a little better but other than that its a great phone
The camera is GREAT, compared to my iPhone4.  I REALLY like the larger screen.  I don't like the fact that I was unable to transfer my calendar from my iPhone4 to the FIRE...still trying to add everything manually.  Another downfall, I am unable to use a lot of the Apps I had on my iPhone4; such as Savings finders (Wal-Mart), certain shopping Apps, Cinemax, etc.  So I still have to use my iPhone for those Apps to continue my rewards programs, etc. - that REALLY STINKS!  It does have some neat features; but had I known I would not be able to use all the same things/apps, I probably would have stuck it out with Apple and gone with the iPhone6.
I love Amazon and I love my kindle fire.  This phone started out ok the first month, but as soon as I surpassed the return deadline, the phone started acting up. The screen freezes, swiping doesn't work, the phone will either power down or restart for no reason.  Some calls never show up on the call log.  Very, very disappointed. I paid 199 for this phone and saw that a month later Amazon was giving this away for 99 cents.  Considering letting another carrier buy out my AT&T; contract just to get rid of this POS.
Very similar to the iphone but talks directly to your kindle and amazon accounts. Very easy to use.
I love my phone. Its a bit difficult to understand at first but I couldnt have made a better choice
My Amazon fire phone is one of the best phones I've ever had. Out does the iPhone leaps and bounds.
Very good phone for amazon users like myself .....Only downfall is the app store wish it was better
great phone,takes the best pics ever,video is awesome,has everything the kindle fire hd has,so its easy to learn to use..mine came already programmed,just added apps i wanted on it..crystal clear talking,not muffled like my "other smartphone"..i love mayday,used it twice ..immediate service..cust.service helped me out where i got stuck and no attitude...i did our entire grocery list by voice,and now my hubby wants one,and he,s a techie so thats a big compliment to amazon...really enjoying it,thanks!
I am not sure how I feel about this phone. I have had it for 2 days now and it;s kind of complicated. There was no instruction book included and transferring contacts and information was kind of a hassle. I ended up entering them manually. It also has had a glitch on facebook, whenever I try to look at feedback on my site it times out...and having issues with text messaging. It is showing I have a message but there is not one on there. I even deleted them all and started over. So far I am having mixed reviews.. I will give it a few weeks for me to adjust to it.
While there are a couple things I hope will change - can't adjust the font on texts (bad for old eyes) and wish my audiobooks didn't stop and start over whenever there is a text or message from Facebook - this is the easiest navigating phone I've ever had.  The sound is amazing and it has a phenomenal camera with great picture editing tools.  Love it.
Bought it for my husband. He was using samsung 3. He loves it everyday more. highly recommend it.
this phone 📱  a very nice a device<br/><br/>I love ❤ ed  4 star 🌟<br/><br/>Thanks amazon 😊
I loved the phone and I think Amazon did everything right coming up with this phone, however AT&T; turned out to be a nightmare experience.  That said, Amazon should ditch them and do something else with this great product.  I thank my lucky stars I found out how much AT&T; is messed up within the 14 day cancellation period.  Only took less than week.
I preordered the phone when it was still priced at $650.<br/>When I received it, I was happy about the experience but not so happy about the cost. The phones integrates very well with the Amazon ecosystem and I finally had native support for the Amazon appstore and all the free apps of the day that I had in my collection. The interface is actually a lot cleaner and intuitive than my previous Android phone, a Galaxy Nexus, though less customizable.<br/>When Amazon announced that it slashed the price by $200 and I called customer service to get my rebate, I was ecstatic! That meant that I ended up paying only $350 for a high end phone and $99 for another year of prime that I would have payed anyways.
Very good phone with a lot of different apps and Prime Amazon free for the first year.
Great phone, extremely easy to use.<br/>Easy switch from Apple to the fire.
It is a great phone the free music and other prime features make it great. Fast and easy to use.
Great phone. My mobile banking app was not available forFire and that was a major drawback to me
Love it.  Took a little to get used to but once I got the hang of it, it works great.
Phone died after 18 days of use. Amazon online and phone customer service was simply terrible . First email actually is pasted below.<br/><br/>"I'm sorry to hear that your Fire phone wont start up even though your battery is full.<br/>That's certainly what we don't want our customers to experience.<br/>I'd love to help resolve this issue for you, but after looking in to your comments, I see that you've already performed the basic troubleshooting by holding the device and then restarting your device, but I see that the issue still isn't resolved.<br/>To help you further in this case, I'd suggest you to reach us via May day as this seems to be an unusual device issue which needs to be handled by our technical specialist on phone or chat as it will be convenient for us to track the root cause of the problem which will help us in providing an accurate and expedient resolution to you or see if you need any replacement.<br/><br/>Also, It’s Amazon’s policy to offer our customers a replacement device rather than repair their original device if its needed. We can also provide you with the return instructions for your Fire phone in case if the device is replaced.<br/><br/>I'm sorry as this extra step might cause you any inconvenience and I also realize that at this point of time asking you to contact us again would be disappointing, but we do not want to provide any unwanted information to you. We want to make sure that the issue is resolved quickly.<br/><br/>To reach us via May day, swipe down from the device home screen and then tap on May Day.

We hope to see you again.<br/><br/>Did I solve your problem?"<br/><br/>REALLY, did you salve my problem  -I'm sorry your phone is dead, i cant help you please turn on said dead phone and use the Mayday function!!!  Honestly one cant make this up.<br/><br/>FYI<br/>Fire Phone help /warranty information page says "contact us as listed below , w/o any contact info on said page.  Phone was rushed out too soon many production issues and too many key apps not available on the Amazon App store this coupled with poor quality and ever poorer customer service results in my first one star rating
It's awesome!
Only complaint is can not use banking app on this system. Other than that the phone is amazing.
I love this phone. It has so many features.I would recommend this phone to everyone.
My wife switched from the I Phone 4s to Fire phone. At first we were confused about how to use it, but we had used I Phones for a few years. The I Phones operating problems, I Tunes and customer service are very lacking. After a few weeks of using the Fire phone we are so pleased that I ordered myself one today. I you run into a problem press the May Day button and you get live video support immediately. (Very Impressed).  The sound system is superior to I Phone. Check it out.
I had iPhones for approximately 8 years .. I wanted to try new phone because every time Apple had new updates it would slow down my phone and it seemed like every year they just want you to buy the newer phone which is the same with 1 cool new feature.. I got fire phone because they told me it wasn't as complicated as the Samsung or other phones, I don't like that you can download the starbucks app or other apps and it took a long long time when I first started it up.I had to shut it down three times. Lastly the date and time doesn't not show on the main screen you have to change your setting ng for it.
Thanks for all of the useless reviews. @#$%! democrats...
Real good phone ,excellent high definition on the pictures.Definitely happy with my purchase.
It's a good phone but does have a couple apps that are not supposed other than that I like it
I like features like Auto scrolling, Swilve, and Dynamic perspective. Its really good to use.
Honestly this is a great phone and likely the best Android based phone I have owned. I am invested in the Amazon eco system as I buy all my music and videos on Amazon, Fire Tablet and Fire TV as well as having Amazon Prime, now with an additional year for free! Due to this everything works great and is so simple. I do miss some apps that are not in the Amazon app store however the selection is way better that I was expecting. If the device had Google Play store then it would have been a 5 star review and made phone perfect!
Love my fire phone! The screen resolution is breath taking, long battery life, perfect phone
My only complaint is the font. You should be able to change the font size for text messages.
A little difficult to navigate at first but the screen is bright and larger than I expected
After six years I am officially a former iPhone owner!  The Amazon Fire has lived up to my expectations and beyond.  I expected difficulty in switching from the Apple operating system to an android system, but it was a breeze!  Except for some unavailable apps, which will soon be available, the fire phone has everything the iPhone had to offer and some additional, exciting features.  Dynamic perspective, 32 gig out-of-the-box, scrolling with the tilt of your hand, and Free Amazon prime for year just to name a few!
Didn't Light My Fire ... It's unnecessary that many of the Fire's key features, like unlimited cloud photo storage, are supported by Amazon's data centers that are powered by coal and other dirty energy. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon.
This is a very good phone had one but lost it so hurry up and put it back on sell need one
This phone exceeds expectations an plentiful storage space so I can take a lot of pictures
Most people don't understand technology and how it evolves, when great things become greater and how the Fire fits into the scheme of things. This phone will be similar to all new phones, there are going to be bugs and a lack of what people want in the way of apps/software but it's already coming fast. Dynamic perspective....yeah IPhone lock screen has something similar but they don't have it like the Fire. Firefly....great for on the go and you need to know the name of that song before it kills you. I will have more to rant about later with the Fire, but so far so good.
Really easy to work awesome extras. Does freeze up once and awhile but overall I love it!
I got tired of paying for extra texts on my LG traction and yet not using the accumulated minutes.  The fire slides nicely in the middle between a high end smartphone  and a basic trac with texting and internet.<br/>Much better keyboard on the fire, screen quality, etc.  I think this is the niche that is Amazon's only hope and they have realized it.  Dropping the price to 99 cents allows that to occur.  Love the fire phone..did not have a smartphone prior.  No issues with AT&T; so far, but will see.
Great phone.
I like my Amazon Fire Phone very much.  Just need to learn to use all of it.  Thank you.
I love this phone. Amazon as yet again out done themselves. I had an IPhone 4S, when the request came to up grade the software. I done so. It took up so much memory that I couldn't  keep my son's games. It's when I went shopping for a new phone. And so glade that I came across the Fire Phone. I'm use to the Android power with my Kindle Fire. It has been the best devices that I've had in awhile. So many cool apps. Still I'm finding more cool new thing that this phone can do. I give it a 5 star rating and love every second of owning this new Amazon Fire Phone.
This is a beautiful phone. Very easy to use and some of the features blow my mind, Firefly and Dynamic Perspective are really cool. I love the lock screen pics that move as you tilt your phone and/or head. I upgraded from an iPhone 4 so the speed and storage capacity are far beyond what I'm used to. The one free year of Amazon Prime included with purchase is absolutely awesome!<br/><br/>The only drawback for me is that some apps that I like are not available on the Amazon shop but there are ways around that so I am overall very happy with my Fire Phone.
This is not a good phone. It's an excellent phone! Having used both an iPhone and various Android devices I can safely say that this is<br/>the very best device I have used thus far. Exceptional screen resolution. Transferring my  contacts from my old phone was  a breeze.<br/>Firefly is amazing! Dynamic Perspective is also. The one hand operation is great. Job well done!
I am very happy with this phone very clear reception no problems love all the features
Best phone I have ever owned. So good I bought one for my wife also. Highly recommend.
I still have a lot to learn, but I'm having the time of my life with it.  I love it!!!
It is an interesting phone with lots of potential and disappointments. I cannot use square or Amazon register with this phone; which is disappointing to me luckily I was able to use a tablet on those. The apps selection needs a lot of improvement and phone compatibility with the apps as well. Nice graphics as far as I can tell. Several services att  offers this phone is not compatible. But, hopefully Amazon and att  can meet eye to eye on some of the issues with this phone.Will take some getting use to but I will continue to use phone a little while longer. Wish the app zedge would of worked. But over all I am pleased.
I switched from S4 to fire phone and I totally satisfied with my experience. The App store has all basic Apps that I use on my daily life. Phone lasts all day without recharging on my normal usage, email, calling, texting, news, facebooking and occasional videos. I also found 1Mobile on Amazon store that allows you  to install any android App on Google Play.
Just feels like a huge mistake, really wanted to love it, buy the lack of apps, and the struggle with the device , doesn't worth the free year of prime, I hope soon enough the develop some more essential apps, and allow so basic and needed apps from Google, like g-mail and maps( your maps just aren't that good)
Great phone, feels soild. Just had to install the play store to get the apps I need.
Love my new kindle fire.  So excited to play on it and a real pleasure to read from.
Love this phone. Even better than I expected. Would recommend it to anyone.<br/>Ll,
As a prime user and kindle fire hd owner, this phone is awesome!!!...All of my apps were available from the cloud....another free year of prime, unlimited cloud storage for photos, prime music, firefly, dynamic perspective are all pluses for me....have't used google play in years, and any app not on amazon can be sideloaded....other than cost (partially offset by free year of prime) and being tied to one provider there is no downside to this phone in my view.
Love my phone, works great, camera's good, I am happy with this purchase
So far my experience has not been all that great. The apps are about 3 updates behind and in the first week I have already experienced glitches that have forced me to have to reset the phone. It has a lot of bugs to be worked out. It will be a great phone when they get those taken care of. Plus there is not a "back button" option to be found. This makes it a pain to navigate within apps.
It was hard to understand at first but I love it. It's very futuristic in my eyes.
I love this phone for the most. Only complaint I really have is the battery sucks.
The phone is excellent , I need to know more about my phone.  I am still learning.
Phone is ok. Needs some bug fixes with some apps. Overheating is an issue when charging. Main thing I was told it was google app compatible but so far can't install any google play store apps like I could with an Amazon app on a Google Android phone. Hoping future updates will correct these issues. Keeping the phone in hopes the bugs will work out in time. It is user friendly and screen size and quality of pic is superb.  Sound quality is good but not as high as that of my kindle fire. Had the phone 2 wks now. Battery life not as long as I'd hoped when using the phone alot for web and navigation.
Great phone
Love it !!!
Great product, have had no problems, love the mayday feature. Highly recommended.
Great Phone has small software bug but they are working on it. Movies are awsome!
I absolutely cannot stand this phone, it has way too many glitches. its freezes up non stop, then I have to restart it. the keyboard goes blank all the time which makes me have to restart it as well. photos and videos cannot be shared half the time because it says the file is too big. camera only takes good pics half the time. im very disappointed I wish I would've stayed with my iphone
Very nice phone even among the other Android based phones I have used.
I just got this phone last week, and I'm just familiarizing myself with it. But I think I'm going to love it.  I never owned a smart phone before, so it does take time to get use to.  I called to request the owners manual on the first day that I turned it on, and received it in my e-mail within 5 minutes.  The instructions so far are quite easy. Its working out great.  Now I can bug my daughter with too many text messages.  Pay back is a beach!
I have been searching for a phone like this forever!!!<br/>It has a great picture and fantastic clarity in movies and video and photos. The MayDay feature is awesome for people like me who are not techies and need some help once in a while....talking to a real person on your phone screen to guide you through any problems is awesome. So glad I bought this phone and my husband liked mine so much we bought him one too. A year of free Prime topped off this fantastic package. I would recommend this phone to everyone, you will love it, I promise.<br/>Amazon Prime Rocks !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The Fire could be MUCH better. I'm giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage. Amazon's Fire's reliance on dirty energy isn't cutting edge, and it's completely unnecessary. Storing our photos, music and messages shouldn't mean we are forced to damage the health of our climate and communities. If competitors like Apple, Facebook, and Google can power their cloud with renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a "smarter" phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.
Love my fire phone just haven't played with it enough yet there's a lot to learn
Best investment I have made on a cell phone, this phone exceeds my expectations.
The phone works well. The screen is good. The camera works well. The battery lasts several days. The only bad thing, and it would have been a deal breaker IF I had known about it beforehand, is the abject lack of usable apps. None of the Google apps that I used a lot, things like Square, Navigator, etc will run on the Amazon Fire phone. I will be getting rid of it as fast as I can because it does almost nothing of what I need it for.
Phone is nice, but Amazon is not honoring the full year of Prime as advertised.
Love it!!! Has great graphics and easy-to-use. This is my first smart phone.
Still learning to use the Fire phone's many attributes but so far I love it.
Besides the worst battery life of any phone I have ever had, I had to turn off all the special features since every move you make will result in the phone doing something that you don't want to do. Picture quality is not good at all, but all the phone graphics are great. Constantly kicks out of wifi inside my home which has never happen with any of my phones. I use the phone for personal use only. Its great for FaceBook and other social media. Games play very well on this phone.
Compare to my old GS4, fire Phone is pretty fast. It looks 2-3 times faster than GS4.<br/>Carousel could be better if it only scroll vertical. Because not all application needs show extra information. For those applications, an icon is enough, so more tasks can be show on screen. It helps switch between applications.<br/>Another tiny bug, there are 2 30 minutes options in Screen Automiatically Lock setting.
I love everything about it, but mostly that it syncs with my other Kindles.
Only had for 1 month so far so good. Have a fire tablet and love my tablet.
Overall, I like the phone. It's size and shape is perfect. It takes gorgeous pictures!! But, it can use some improvements on some features. In texting, it doesn't offer another language (you would have to change your settings completely), the apps selections are limited, and there are other small things I have yet to figure out. But, their feature of getting help immediately from a live person is awesome.
Good phone
It's okay. The only thing I don't like is the app store and the ringtones.
Love love love this phone even my husband he just had order it for himself
its not as great as I thought is was going to be. I like my Iphone better.
The Amazon fire phone is great!!!! Just don't go through AT&T; for it. I picked the phone up last week and unfortunately the glass cracked. I went back to have it fixed through insurance and was told they no longer carry the phone and can have an HTC for a replacement for $200. Within one week of me having the phone. They say they are all out and it is my only option. An HTC is not a comparable product this the Amazon fire phone is amazing!! Just wish I could have the glass  replaced...... hey Amazon talk to AT&T; they say it's not worth having
Great phone only thing is it didn't give me a new year of prime services.
This is the best phone I have bought, it makes my last two Iphones seem obsolete. I like the way it fits in my hand and the screen size is much easier for me to see. It is so easy to operate and I love the 3 D effect. I look forward each day to see what the new screen saver is. There are still many new features for me to explore as I just bought the Fire Phone two weeks ago and I can't wait!!
I have the amazon fire phone, I like it but I wish amazon would have made software to make it easy to get photo's off the phone.  I still haven't figured it out.  And the app store is limited.  There are many apps I used on my iphone, that they have on google play, but not in the amazon store.  That kind of bummed me out.  If they can fix the syncing made easy and taking off my photo's with easy like the iphone did, I would give it clearly a 5 star review.
Awesome phone and built to stand. It's just that there aren't many apps.
Love the phone, takes a little getting used to it but overall I love it.
Took me a few days to get used to this phone, but I love the features and was so surprised when I noticed that it already linked to my Kindle and Prime Music Playlist. I have to admit some of the features take time getting used to because the phone is very different from any other phone I've had, but overall the phone is great.
I am delighted with my Amazon Fire Phone (AT&T;).  My daughters convinced me that I needed a "major" upgrade to my cell phone (an LG slide phone that was well worn) and said that this would be perfect for me since I already owned and enjoyed my Kindle Fire HD very much.  They were absolutely correct.  I now am sending and receiving texts and pics as well as reading, and more, all on a device that slips into my pocket.  Great device.  Thanks.
I love my Fire phone! It does everything I need and more!! Thank you!!!
My husband calls me an "Amazon super user". I Kindle, I "amazon Music player", and otherwise, I do 10-30% of all monthly purchases off of AMazon. I have already been with AT&T; a long while. When Amazon brought the price down to free with contract plus Prime Membership, I snapped it up. I am not tech savvy by any means, so am probably the average user of most phones.I purchased this Sept 15th.<br/><br/>What I feel about the phone is complex, therefore, simply pros and cons wouldn't suit.<br/><br/>LOVE-<br/><br/>1. Excellent 24/7 customer service.<br/>2. One year of Free Amazon Prime I'm totally using to actually EARN money.<br/>3. I like the battery life, so I'm listing it. But I've trained myself to use the lowest brightness setting near constantly for years now. (just read I could turn off Dynamic to save battery life. Sweet!)<br/>4. Love playing and, yes, actually using Firefly. I use it to scan phone numbers and emails for contact info as well as items/barcodes. I comparison shop 10x faster with this built in software while in store! It "listens" to songs on the radio so I finally know the song (although I am now aware there is an app for this.) I consider this a strong PRO feature for me.<br/>5. I love that there are various volumes to modify; Media vs ring tone. Also, love the "silent for 3 hours" option! Perfect for a movie or going to class.<br/>6. When I do increase the brightness for media watching, it's a great bright crisp image.<br/>7. The Restart option! Phones are more and more like an actual full blown computer these days, and every now and then, a restart keeps it running smoothly. The option to Restart rather than turn off, wait, manually turn on, wait is great for me. The turn around is quicker. That a phone should never need this seems over optimistic.<br/>8. Like the fact that my emails are in the notifications under carousel.<br/>9. I canceled my Netflix and will survive on prime TV. So, it was free a year, and saved me a year of NEtflix charges. Cha ching.<br/>10. The home button has the best recording task do'er I've ever used. Call -that person-, email -that person-, text -that person-. the speech to text is also the best I've used. It has no trouble keeping up with 4-6 sentences of info with little error.<br/>11. Like the Decline/Reject phone call buttons. Rather than swiping to ignore, one tap'll do ya.<br/>12. Love the Voicemail- can delete without listening! Seriously! I'm anti voicemail though, so perhaps I'm the odd one for being enthused.<br/><br/>NEUTRAL-<br/>1. Dynamic Perspective: It's a gimmick. It's neat to show off, but does absolutely nothing functional for me. (will turn off.) Apparently great for some video games, but who plays full blown video games on such a small screen?<br/>2. Navigation options: Swiping vs back button- Something to get used to, kinda weird they decided to branch off in this 3. direction, but acceptable. I don't use the "flick wrist" as it's an awkward motion that doesn't always work so why bother.<br/>4. Satisfied with Size- if I don't want to do something on my phone, I have a kindle fire HDX in my purse most of the time anyway. I pretty much only use my Fire phone for extensive internet reading when there isn't Wifi available for Kindle.<br/>5. I'm not a camera person; I am neither impressed or disappointed with the pictures it takes.I'm also a little confused how the cloud for pictures works; I got some notices that pictures had been uploaded without my inducing it to do so. But then have not received any notices for two weeks despite taking pictures.<br/><br/>MILD ANNOYING-Not exactly cons<br/>1. I wish the firefly button was separate from the camera button, as I accidentally turn it on every single time I try to use the camera.<br/>2. Rarely, the swipe to move through multiple pages of icons is tricky.<br/><br/>Cons-<br/><br/>1. Missing apps. Like, seriously. I expected some to show up in the month since purchase, but still no go. I seriously miss some apps- how can they  not even have a good step counter app? If they hadn't had YNAB, I wouldn't have bothered getting it though.<br/>2. Speaking of apps- the built in clock/alarm is not good. And I can't even remove it to boot, so moved it to the "bottom" of my app icons. There are a few other built in unremovable apps I've done the same to. HATE the built in Maps!!!!!!<br/>Downloaded Mapquest- hate it too. I now use the internet to indirectly get to Google Meps. This seriously ticks me off, Amazon. Don't force me to use your product if it comes nowhere near to what it's replacing.<br/>3  Media Volume- it's not great! I think speaker location should be reconsidered because I have to be UP on that phone to watch a youtube video.<br/>4. I don't like the lack of SIM card. I used the "transfer contacts app" and it still only brought over 60% of my contacts. I then had to manually enter in what I was missing. A month later, I am still re collecting numbers.<br/>4.  I find the "tilt to scroll" to be tricky and it sometimes activates when I'm changing my seated position; then I get to swipe all the way back up to the top of my internet page. Meh.<br/><br/>Another reviewer said they couldn't use GMAIL on their phone- I use it just fine. Maybe they meant some aspects of GMAIL I don't use. Like their docs? I just use them as my primary email.<br/><br/>Overall, I look forward to the second generation of this phone, and am satisfied with the first, although disappointed in areas. (APPS, geez!)<br/><br/> I am the sort of person to use my phone till it's near dead. But now that I have a satisfying first gen, I can wait until then and then some for people to weigh in.
Phone works well...reception is great and it is easy to use.
I love my new phone. I'm also enjoying my 1 year subscription to Prime
Not available in my zip code.  Really?  I'm in Virginia, and I can't get this?  I'm in the market for a knew phone, and in my research, I stumble on this.  So, I have a kindle, Amazon fire TV, and all the TV / movies I watch I get from prime.  So, I think this would be a perfect phone, but no, can't get it in Virginia.  I have AT&T; (here in Va), whom amazon offers the plan with, but not here.  Guess I'll get the Samsung Galaxy after all.
Maybe I'll get to like it better as time goes on. Can't figure out how to save a number I've received as a phone call or text to contacts. Seems to use data like there's an unlimited supply of it. Maybe a little faster than my Verizon 3G Droid phone that died, but since it sucks up data, I'm afraid to find out. Seem to be a lot of dead spots where I'm used to having coverage.<br/><br/>Maybe I'll get to like it better as time goes on.
We own two of them because of the deep discounts and Prime subscriptions.  I would rather use iPhones, but I don't want to worry over $600 handhelds.  I still use an iPhone 4s as a mobile media player.  Can't beat the 4s for that. The fire phone works ok  as a utility device. I suppose someday I may root and reimage, but there's no rush.  Amazon wasn't able take its platform to Apple-grade.  Apple remains the gold standard for operability and stability and at a premium cost. The Fire is easy to factory reset.  :)
I was hesitant at first when I saw the Amazon Fire because I was use to only iphones , plus shopping for a new phone is so hard nowadays because there's so many to choose from and all the companies are trying to shove their phones in your face,  but wow! I really like this phone.It has so many features and you can do so many things on it and with it, I'm really glad I bought this phone. I highly recommend the Amazon Fire to everyone.
I wish it would have come with a booklet to help learn how to use it.
I just love all my fire products! I would recommend them to EVERYONE!
I love this phone - it's pleasing to the easy, it's super easy to figure out and use, and it has cool features like the Amazon wallet app and 3D pictures. The only reason I didn't give this phone 5 stars is because since it runs on an Amazon operating system, there are many apps available through Android or iTunes Store that are not available on this phone (for example, GroupMe and Snapchat). These are pretty popular apps so my hope is that with time, the Amazon App Store will start having those available.
I got this on July 24. So far it seems like a really good phone.  Good signal strength, even in the black hole of cell reception that is my neighborhood.  Voice quality is clear, phone is extremely responsive, gorgeous display and seems to be of quality construction. It's thin and light.  It is a bit light on features, and  I hope to see more customization via apps later, but as a phone it performs very well. No regrets here.
Absolutely love it! Just wish you could customize the the background
yes it does, should open up to more phones who offer unlimited data,
I love this phone. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it at all.
The fire is a cool device, however, you cannot have pictures or an image in the back screen it's black. You can't see notifications in a locked screen it just shows you you have a text message or email. You don't see how my notifications you have for any apps and your not alerted for them. I have to use my iPhone for some of my other apps because the fire doesn't have them and will not know when they'll be getting them.
I love it
Love it!!
After being very familiar with kindled, the fire phone is a breeze.
Excellent phone.  Would give it five stars if there were more apps.
This phone is the best decision I have made to buy in a long while.
Amazing I like it. If you know your kindle then you run your phone
Absolutely the most fantastic phone is a pleasure to use I love it
I like it.  It is my first smart phone and I am still learning it.
Got my phone today and I am loving it!!! I've been on it for a few hours now and it is not hot like others complained about. Use your own judgement when deciding on this phone. I had a droid razor and I like this phone better! The camera is outstanding as well. Also impressed with AT&T; so far. Pricing is better than what I had at US Cellular. By far. You can't beat the prime membership either! This phone rocks!
The fire phone apps have a lot to be desired.  File structure is not-intuitive.  Transferring of personal pictures, videos, music should be straight forward but the apps are not designed to serve that way.  To transfer videos you have to drop the files in pictures folder.  If pictures folder is not present you can create one.  However, creating a video folder would not work.  Same is the story with music folder.  I loved my LG android.  Often going back to the last page is not easy.
Never got a SIM card, just use it as a mini Kindle Fire. LOVE it.
If you love your Kindle, you will love this phone.  It's awesome!
It's great love Kindle products  It was very easy to use. THANKS.
This phone is so much smarter than I am...but, it is easy to use.
Very easy to use, very uncomplicated and has great functionality.
Can't get the walmart savingscatcher app on it very disappointing
I like it. It's somewhat different than the other phones.  Thanks
I love my new phone! It takes the best photos. Worth every penny.
The phone is easy to use and a good size for someone with small hands. I don't use a lot of apps for things so the phone works well for me. The camera is very clear and the pictures look great. I wish there were more ringtone options and notification tones. The ones on the phone aren't too bad and I haven't really found an app with tones I like. My two biggest issues with the phone are the battery seems to run down very quickly and it freezes and shuts off on me pretty often.
This phone is great. It's my first non-iphond, so there has been a bit of an adjustment. Overall it's nice. I love how quickly the predictive text learns, and it picks up words android has given me trouble with. My only complaint is occasionally my keyboard will disappear and I have to restart my phone. I'd like to see a fix for that in the future. Otherwise I have nothing but praise for this phone.
Love this phone!! It is the easiest smart phone I have ever had.
Overall the phone is great but it is missing alot of apps that the google store offers along with one major downside. Bluetooth 4.0 . I can not even use my Fitbit that i have for it. For being an advance phone it is missing out on technology that should be inside the phone. If you have the app in the appstore at least make it so that the phone is compatiable to work with it. If not remove the app.
When I was ready to make the transition away from the iPhone, I read the Android reviews on my "go to" site of Amazon and read that their hotly anticipated Fire Phone was due to release in a week.  This was a total no-brainer...buy the Fire Phone, Amazon would SURELY help me take that frightening leap away from Apple technology?<br/><br/>While the MayDay staff has been super friendly and helpful, I wish Amazon would get their act together on software updates.  I have a message icon that won't clear so it always looks like I have one unread message.  They said their next software update would fix it.  Waited 3 long weeks and was SO EXCITED when the notification popped up that their was a system update available to be installed!  I anxiously download and restart the phone...one new message notification remains with no new message.  It was approximately 6 weeks between software updates last time...looks like I will have to endure this nonsense for an unfortunate while longer. <insert extreme sad face here><br/><br/>Other issues:<br/>Phone randomly restarts itself.  I don't know why.  Maybe it gets tired?  Maybe it is in a smartphone union and can only work X hours a day?  Highly annoying.<br/><br/>My call history will randomly disappear.  Notice I'm using the word RANDOM a lot?  There seems to be no rhyme or reason to the phone's malfunctions.<br/><br/>The phone will freeze up...requiring a restart.  I had never restarted my iPhone 5 in the two years I used it as much as I have the 3 months I've owned the Fire Phone.<br/><br/>I don't even want to talk about the price I paid at release then finding out it went to 99 cents a week later.  Ouch.  Just Ouch.<br/><br/>And then there is AT&T...who; can only seem to enforce the contract that keeps me in this bad cell phone marriage.  I hope Amazon can do something to fix the technical issues and soon (or get me a new phone).  I hope the next review I write is about the awesome service I received to try and fix my issues.  Hint...hint...
I got this phone from AT&T; so it might not show up as a verified purchase, but I'm writing this review with on my Amazon Fire phone right now. I was afraid to buy this through Amazon for some reason, I didn't know how to get it hooked up to my AT&T; service if I did. Probably should've just went ahead with it through Amazon though, cause I want to return this thing so badly I can't stand it. AT&T; won't give me a refund on this because I exceeded my 14 day limit by 2-3 days. For $650, this phone is not worth it. I usually don't review things I don't like on Amazon, but I'm particularly upset with this purchase. I love Amazon to death, I seriously look to this website to buy something before I even consider anywhere else. I love prime, in fact I absolutely adore prime, and that's the one thing that's keeping this a three star review. The prime integration on this phone is a great feature, and the free year of prime is also very nice cause it feels like I bought a $550 phone instead of $650. Helps soften the blow a bit. The phone itself isn't bad I guess, dynamic perspective is a gimmick and I didn't realize that until after my two week return period. I don't even use firefly, so that's a waste to me. At $650 you can get MUCH better phones, like the Samsung galaxy s5, the LG G3, or the iPhone 5S. I came to this phone because it was new, I was sick of having an iPhone. I had a 5, it got stolen, and I went to my old iPhone 4 for a while, and I'd rather have the iPhone 4 than the Amazon fire phone. I just wish I would've went and returned this earlier, and yes I realize that that is totally my fault. I should've bought this phone directly from Amazon I guess, cause I'm well within the thirty day limit. Oh well, guess I'm just stuck with it for a while. As far as the build quality and call quality I have got to give this phone credit there. I've never heard calls so clear on any phone in my life. The build quality is good, I like the rubber edges around the side of the phone for some reason. The phone feels nice, it's not too heavy, not too thick, but it still feels sturdy. And this screen size has grown to be my favorite of the phones that I've played with. The speaker quality is a little weird, they have decided to put one on top and one on the bottom, I guess to try to give more of a surround sound feel to it? I don't know, but I'm not the biggest fan of it. My auxiliary cable won't work with the phone which kind of ticked me off. It had this horrible hissing clicking sound, might be something I was doing, I don't know. But the cable worked fine with my iPhones. Dynamic perspective is pretty awful most of the time, it will work when I don't want it too, and it won't work when I want it too. Having the side menus is great, having the top down menu is great as well. This phone is very cleanly laid out, everything on my home pages is aesthetically pleasing. There are some key features for me that definitely need to be fixed, such as the text tone. Every time I send a text when I have my ringer on, it makes this dumb noise that I can't get rid of unless I have my ringer turned off. Every time you try to turn the ringer off, it lets out a loud click letting you know how loud your ring tone will be, well that's fine and dandy and all, but you can't turn that feature off. So when I try to put it on vibrate or silent, I have to hear this loud click before I can change it. I know I can go to my settings and change it there, but I shouldn't be forced to hunt and dig through my phone to change the ringer volume without a loud noise coming from it, I should be able to turn off the clicking, test tone like sound in the settings, I think. I also can't change my media volume without letting something start to play for a little bit. While I can go to my settings and change this, it's very inconvenient. All of this could've been fixed with a switch on the side to change your phone from ring to silent, because that opens up the possibility to make your ring volume non adjustable with the volume switch. This phone has potential, but it just doesn't deliver for the cost, and unfortunately I didn't realize that until it was too late return it. Really really wanted to love this phone, but I just can't. I feel like I got screwed buying it since its enormous price tag can be matched by phones that are without a doubt better in most, if not all, aspects. The lack of returning ability didn't affect this review, it's as honest as I can make it. However, if I could've returned it I wouldn't have said anything about it at all.
UPDATE:  October 13:  Contrary to what I'd read and experienced with the first phone the contacts can be transfered from the Samsung Brightside feature phone to the Fire, as well as all my photos.  It just takes someone who knows what they are doing. I could barely hear on the first phone, but this one is different as I can hear well.  New to Smartphone, but I do like this phone.  I am still in the learning process.  Although the phone was $99 I somehow ended up paying the $549 price with a two year contract!  ATT is slick, so beware.  No problems with the phone, but I've used it very little, however, sometimes I cannot get a connection or I run into dead space where no calls can be made.  I believe this is related to coverage, not the phone.  ATT sells a micro cell tower for use at home to get better connection (around $300+.) I didn't buy it. I will honor the contract, but hopefully, Fire Phone will be available on Verizon after contract ends.  I never had connection issues with Verizon, plus I question ATT business practices.  Really like the Fire, though.<br/><br/>UPDATE: August 29:  I was on the phone today with three different AT&T; employees and received as many explanations, none the same.  Just returned from vacation and had a bill for $164.19, the reason for my call to AT&T;, for less than 14 days service.  One rep said account had "zero balance" then lost connection to him and he didn't return the call, and when I phoned back I was told my balance was $119 and change by a different rep with very thick accent, but don't know what I was charged for.  I did receive a restock charge after being told there would be no such charge.  I am disappointed and really want the phone, but am scared of AT&T.;  Their billing is confusing, and so are their employees.  The letter I wrote came back as undeliverable.  Hard to nail this company down on mailing address, but have resent letters to other addresses and hope to get a response.  Just don't see why I should have to pay $119 or $164 for less than 14 days of service.<br/><br/>UPDATE August 11:  Sadly I am returning my phone today.  I went to the AT&T; store yesterday to inquire about the Mobile Package (I was getting texts from AT&T; to complete setup)and was told it is "automatically" added with purchase of new service.  I was horrified as I was unaware of this being added to my plan, had no paperwork to justify it, and disgusted I did not have the option to decline it, however, I had seen a paper that was checked with the word "Declined" but it was not with the paperwork I received.  It was the attitude and treatment of the personnel that was upsetting to me, and visions of previous AT&T; service ran through my head.  I asked to see the paperwork where the service was ordered and was told by the two staff present "There is no paperwork, either you want the service or you don't, and if you don't want it you can cancel it."  I said so AT&T; can add any service to my account without my knowledge, and was told "Yes."  I said that did not sound right, but the sales person got huffy.  No manager was available so I left.  I went to another store at a different suburb and he directed me to another store at a further suburb.  It was at that final store that I was told the AT&T; stores with the AT&T; logo that had "Authorized Retailer" under the name were not AT&T; employess and AT&T; has no control over them.  In fact, "They just want to make sells and can perform the business any way they want to."  I had no idea, but to me, it explains all the complaints about the AT&T; service.  I was unable to return my phone to either of the two additial stores I visited and was instructed to mail it back to where it came from.  This morning I dialed 611<br/>as instucted at the second store I visited if I chose not to drive to the corporate store (the third store), and cancelled my service.  I found it interesting that the operator (very pleasant and kind) told me I could return the phone to any of their corporate stores.  Seems even the employees of AT&T; are confused.  Anyway, I have repackaged my beloved phone for return today.  I was also told I would not be charged a restocking fee, but was not told how my account would be credited.  Guess I'll just have to wait.  (At the corporate store I was told I would have to pay a restocking fee, hmmm.)  I wish AT&T; would monitor the stores selling under their brand.<br/><br/>The phone has some quirks, people, but nothing so serious as not to keep it (except for AT&T; service.)  Yes, it became very hot as I talked and I didn't like that I had to hold it next to my hear (even with the speaker on and volume up), but during a 26 minute talk the phone cooled.  Driving to the other two stores was 3 hours roundtrip for me, just too far to have to go to an AT&T; corporate store, and I refuse to step foot into the "Authorized Retailer" AT&T; store again.  I know it will cost me to cancel service and return the phone, but it is worth it to rid myself of the AT&T; drama.  My life is complicated enough. I MISS MY PHONE, and I purchased such nice accessories.<br/><br/>ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br/>This is my first Smartphone so I cannot give a technical review.  It is unfortunate that most of the negative reviews are from people who don't even own the phone, or want primarily to use the phone to play games, and did not give usable reviews.  I am glad I decided to make my own decision to buy the phone.  There is a learning curve if you are new to using a Smartphone.  Apps are nice, but the most important thing for me is to be able to use the phone as a phone!  Unfortunately, information to using it as such is scant even in the user manual (which I printed), then later found it is also available on the phone.  I like the printed copy.<br/><br/>I can barely hear when making calls or listening to voicemail, and cannot figure out how to turn the speakphone on.  I can hear downloaded music fine, but wish I could figure out how to use it as a speaker phone when using voice.  This issue is not addressed in the user guide.  I tried using with the earbuds, but did not receive any better sound or volume quality with them.<br/><br/>I like the weight of the phone.  I suspect the battery runs down fast because of my exploration of the phone in learning to use it, but I think it recharges quickly.  I was unable to transfer my contacts from my feature phone, the Samsung Brightside, and will have to enter each contact manually, which is unfortunate.  I also like the Dynamic Perspective.  I have been unable to get the camera and Firefly to work, but figure I am doing something wrong so will continue trying.<br/><br/>The sales personnel at AT&T; failed to tell me they did not have the phone available, (even though I was in the store 4 times before I made the purchase), and essentially deceived me about the service by omission.  Before I signed with AT&T; they said I would get a federal employee/retiree discount and possibly waiver of the activation fee, but when I went to sign-up I discovered those discounts were not immediately available.  (I sent a letter to At&T; headquarters, but am now locked into a contract, but I like my phone and plan to keep it, sooooo... )  Also, they had little knowledge about the phone and really could not help me, so I am flying solo.  I will use Mayday as needed, but need to try and figure things out more on my own.  I've used Mayday twice, with mixed results.  I wish the author of the user guide did not presume everyone has knowledge of how to use a Smartphone, and need really basic instruction, but hope I will figure it out soon.<br/><br/>All-in-all I think it is a nice phone and am glad I purchased it.  Having to go with AT&T; was almost a deal breaker, but things change and I am hoping for better service this time around.  However, I received an e-mail from AT&T; thanking me for signing up for their Mobile Protection Pack.  I did not sign up for such a pack (have no idea what it is) and asked that they not bill me for it.  I hope I will not have to battle with them.  Their service is expensive enough without adding unnecessary costs.<br/><br/>I've already received a couple of updates and feel confident Amazon will make the necessary improvements.  I think the phone deserves a chance.  Good luck.
This phone is great. Only had it for a few days, but I like it more than my previous iPhone. I originally had an iPhone 4.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-The amazon fire 64GB is cheaper than the current iPhone 64GB.<br/>-Great streamlining for everything amazon. I buy most of my music through amazon rather than iTunes, so this is is a much better system for me. If you have prime, everything about the kindle lending library, prime music, prime instant video make this phone phenomenal.<br/>-Great camera.<br/>-Firefly is crazy cool. I tried it out on a tv show. Firefly picked it out correctly and showed me actors'  links to imdb and imdb show information. How? Amazon sorcery.<br/>-Dynamic perspective? Unreal. Don't know if it is a necessary feature, but I'm loving it.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-the fire phone gets really warm--like "fire" warm. Get it? See what I did there? I don't consider this a pro, though. Definitely a con.<br/>-This is more of apple's fault than amazon--so this isn't a con for the actual amazon fire phone. I used iMessages on my iPhone so now some of my text messages are not coming in if they are sent by an iPhone user. The iPhone user will have the text listed as delivered or will continue to say message has failed until the text is sent as SMS manually. Some friends or family have said they texted me; don't see it because iMessage thought I still existed on iPhone. Luckily, apple offers this kind of support for free, so I keep calling to deactivate and problem solve this issue. If you switch from an iPhone with iMessage to any non-iPhone you will have this problem, so it is not an amazon fire phone only thing. Read up about an iPhone iMessage deactivation before you switch. This is just something you need to know going in; it will be frustrating, but if you ever want to switch from an iPhone to a non-iPhone, you have to do it. This whole thing makes me dislike apple even more now.
Love the new phone, great audio and screen, excellent camera, perfect size and a host of valuable free stuff including PRIME (free 2 day Amazon shipping for a year, and their movie/music service. All the 2 stars seem to b people with a gmail account. Nice surprises were some world class buds, and an additional $10 to use for apps.
I am extremely happy with the Amazon Fire phone. Pros: Dynamic View, Firefly, simple one hand short cuts, and of course ease and use of Amazon Prime.  My only cons for this phone is the lack of apps (which is temporary) and the battery life which is about the same as my old iphone.<br/><br/>In short, I am very happy with it.
I have only had the phone for about a wk. So far so good. I do not have a Kindle so was all new to me. I really like the phone. Except with two apps i have had Badoo, there is an error to log in everytime. saying it can't connect to facebook, which is only on my phone no other devices. The other app is Facebook msger. IT works fine other then clicking it notifications it kinda freezes until i hit the home screen button. if i just click the Msger Icon it works fine.
<br/>It didn't take long to learn, even when I did read the books. In my opinion it's much better than the iPhone and others. I guess I am just A AMAZON FIRE PHONE AND FIRE HDX PERSON Customer service is the best and I haven't had anything negative to say. One day maybe I'll be able to afford the Fire TV.
I got this phone on day one.  I know it was a risk buying so early, but Amazon typically does a great job on everything and the phone does provide some value, but the total lack of apps after more than 3 months is completely frustrating and i'm not going to be able to continue with this phone.  The biggest reason to have a smart phone, at least for me, is not to watch TV or movies or even read books, but it is to make your life easier with all of the useful apps.  I expected that we would see new apps come on board quickly, this has not been the case.  There is no Starbucks, Publix, Map My Run or many of the other apps i used routinely on my iphone.  Also, some of the apps downloaded, Spotify and Tumblr, do not even show on a home screen and have to be opened by going to the app store or searching the cloud for a list of apps.  Software updates seem to occur and some of my apps will disappear.  I'm not sure what happens, but it is annoying.  I have never before given up on Amazon product, or any phone i've owned, but today I am.  I cannot recommend this phone unless you are simply wanting a device to enjoy the benefits of Amazon Prime such as Movies, TV shows and Books.
Awesome phone!!! I'd highly recommend it to any of my  friends
The phone was easy to pick up and use with little instruction.
FINE PHONE, it is very good and the only thing I find a little difficult is untapping the zoom screen. If you tap it twice the screen will zoom in so you can read it better if you have sight problems. (without my glasses I have some difficulty reading certain screens) But I sometimes find it a little bit frustrating trying to exit the zoom and get it back to normal, but I am sure it is something I am not doing correctly. So I would recommend this phone to all.
The Fire Phone is a great phone first and a superb content player as well.  Most phones do other stuff well and sacrifice on phone quality.  I love the phone size and it is a big improvement over my iPhone 4s.  AT&T; let me merge my Kindle Fire HDX and Fire Phone onto one account which is even better value.  Phone calls are crystal clear on the Fire Phone which is better than my AT&T; iPhone 4S was.  I also have an iPad Air which is great but the Kindle (Paperwhite and HDX) get all the usage.  The Air just sits there unused most of the time.  Apple lost me with iOS 7.  I hated the changes.  I do need to sideload some apps on Fire Phone and HDX with 1Mobile Market.  The Fire Phone will be even better as more native apps arrive.  Only two improvements would really seal the deal on this platform... not having to sideload some apps and the speakers on the Fire Phone are not as good as I would like to have.  TV shows and movies are easy to watch on the Fire Phone.
I was thrilled to get the amazon fire and it has its perks and downfalls. it takes great videos, but when you share them on facebook or send it as a message the video is horrible and you cannot edit videos. I am also disappointed about the battery life. I read on the website it was supposed to be long, almost worry free from dying quickly, but it seems I am charging twice a day.
It's just wonderful.  Another example of Amazon's excellence.
I really appreciate not having to call to listen to my voicemails everytime; I just choose the contact that called & press play to hear their message. I will say that I am used to having an Android for Google apps so it was kind of hard getting used to not being able to download all the apps I usually I have but it is a great phone overall. Great picture quality on the camera. Love the alternating security screens. I wake up to something new every day!
I recently switched from the iPhone 5S to the Fire Phone, and it so far has been the best decision I have made regarding cell phones in a long time. I have had all of the iPhones and a couple of android phones. The fire phone's operating system is fun and easy to use. (especially if you have a Kindle) It seems to be a cross between iOS and android. It has more capabilities than the basic iOS and it is not as busy as the android system. The style is great. I have not had any of the problems previously listed about it getting too hot or having a bad battery.<br/>The fire fly app is fun to use, and it works quickly and accurately.<br/>silk web browser works great, and I like it better than safari. I can open my school web pages that I couldn't access on safari on the iPhone.<br/>Amazon apps doesn't provide google apps (you tube, gmail, google maps, ect..) but it is not a big deal for me. The phones email system connected easily to my gmail accounts easily and you can access you tube on the silk browser with out a problem. Fire phones maps are better than google's. Facebook, twitter, linked in and gmail all synced with my contacts with out any issues.<br/>Voicemail is easy to set up, a lot like the iPhone.<br/>So far, I have no complaints and recommend this phone to anyone!<br/>The price is relative to most new phones on the market, not over or under priced.<br/>Camera works great and has built in editing software for easy photo editing.<br/>Free year of Prime!<br/>It is a new phone, and I feel it can only get better!<br/>I feel it is better than the iPhone 5S and the other android phones.<br/>Enjoy!
Help... I have annoying sound on fire phone like turu, turu, turu... It's terrible and i just want to smash him. Every time when i want to do something he starts irritate me. BDW i turn off all sounds, i do all restarts things, master restart etc. What to do? Even a people who doing support online doesn't know, they keep telling me restart your phone, turn off all sounds...
I was REALLY looking forward to this phone and pre-ordered weeks in advance, but was beyond bummed when I learned how boxed in it is. I was optimistic because I knew that the Fire phone was built on an Android foundation, but political battles amongst companies leaves this device coming up short.<br/><br/>The Fire phone packs a unique and fun feature set, but lacks significant functionality and capability due to limitations of Amazon app store. Attempts at side loading apps proved impractical and require an Android device to load apps on initially.<br/><br/>The deal breaker for me is that the app store was really buggy and download buttons were non-responsive at times. The Uber app shows up and then it doesn't and when it finally does - it's not available. Important apps like Toyota's entune, needed to stream data to your car, are not available and instead you're left with a bunch of cheap, 3rd tier apps instead.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, the vehicle that is the Amazon Fire Phone is only as useful as the roads it can drive on and currently it feels like owning a Porsche that you can only drive on side streets. Amazon really needed to beef up their app offering before launching this device in order to keep it competitive.<br/><br/>I tried hard to justify keeping the device, but it's just too big of a step back.
I love the graphics.  Wish they had more apps and ringtones.
Everyone said this phone needs work. It doesn't. All it probably needs in my opinion is a sort of cooling system and an extra gig of RAM. This is hands down my favorite smartphone. People, before you give all sorts of hate to Amazon, look at the quality of the phone first. Don't listen to lousy critics. And, you can get the google play store on the phone. Just google it.
Two years ago I was a die-hard Apple product consumer.  Over the past two years I have switched over to Amazon's TV, Tablet, and now Telephone solutions.  I could not be happier.  This phone is AMAZING.<br/><br/>The technology that it employs, especially the Firefly setup, has had everyone in my office ooh-ing and ahh-ing today.  This is  GREAT for business users that want to quickly look at a printed sheet of paper (or business card) and send an email immediately.  The uses of that technology alone is HUGE!<br/><br/>Being in a profession with Educators, who are always looking for books to read and research but are short on time, Firefly lets them add to wish list in less than a minute without typing a thing.<br/><br/>The gesture and movements are flawless. The display is beautiful. It's fast, and it utilitizes Prime for everything - music, movies, shipping, shopping...<br/><br/>I really, really suggest that everyone get this phone if you are in the market for a new one.  This phone is the biggest technological leap in phones/PDAs since the original iPhone.
One classy piece of engineering. Weniger aber besser.<br/>Understated products are not for the mass buyer.<br/>Respect to Jeff and the Fire Phone team.
Works great just wish it had a more of a ringtone selection
I like this phone but it has its downs but I mostly like it
This has been a great phone, have had no issues I recommend
DONT' BUY THIS EVEN IF THEY GIVE IT TO YOU FOR FREE! My husband and I were Apple iPhone users who were tired of the constant hype and constant software updates that made our old phones (which we were happy with) dysfunctional...you know the ones I'm talking about, the ones that made you buy a new iPhone.  We use these phones to run our small business.  Our livelihoods depend on them.  I am a physician and patients' care depends on them.<br/><br/>So we checked out the Fire phone and it seemed to have everything we needed in a smart phone.  We bought them full price before they were released.....Then we waited 3 weeks to transfer our contacts from our iPhones because Amazon wasn't able to do it over the internet and our local ATT store didn't get the equipment in to do it until 3 weeks after the phones came out.  When we did attempt to transfer the contacts, some transferred multiple times, some not at all.  We wound up with THOUSANDS OF CONTACTS.  My husband had to cull through them by hand to remove duplicates from the phone AND had to manually load some that just wouldn't transfer at all.  Then we transferred them to my phone. Again, some made the jump, some did not.<br/><br/>THEN, last week my husbands phone doesn't work.  When I call him he sounds like the phone is across the room.  He sought help from Mayday.  They told him to back up his phone to the cloud and reset to factory settings.  He backs up the phone TWICE!!!!! He resets to factory settings. Then he restored from the cloud back upthat he had just created.  THERE ARE NO CONTACTS AND ALL OF OUR VACATION PICTURES ARE GONE.  They tell him to wait a bit.  He waits.  NO CONTACTS.  NO PICTURES. NO VIDEOS.  When he inquires how they are going to get the contacts and pics/videos back from the back up he did on the cloud...he is told that the Cloud doesn't back those things up.  After much arguing and asking for a supervisor, he's told that the issue was that the phone didn't stay connected to the internet while it backed up and so the contacts and pics/videos didn't back up.  He points out that he did the back up twice and each time it told us it was successful.  We were then told that the phone wasn't designed to back up you contacts or pictures!?!?!?! We pointed out that unlimited cloud space for your contacts and pics/videos is in THEIR ADS!<br/><br/>Long story short, they CANNOT RECOVER THE ALMOST 800 BUISINESS CONTACT INFO THAT WE HAD STORED ON OUR PHONES (took 15 years to accumulate) AND OUR VACATION PHOTOS AND VIDEOS ARE GONE FOREVER.  Now we realize that Amazon can never make us whole.  Our memories of our trip to all those National Parks in Nevada, Arizona and Utah are gone forever. Thank God we took a bunch with our iPads!.  We can reconstruct our contacts, well most of them anyway.  But it will take hours of work over probably the next year to figure out what is missing and try to get it all together.  But wait til you hear what they offered us to attempt to make up for not being able to make us whole....<br/><br/>First...they offered us any phone they sell under contract on their website.  Well, there was only one Smart phone and it was old technology.  When we explained that we bought a top of the line latest technology smartphone to replace our older iPhones and that is what we wanted...new iPhones, they told us they couldn't do that.  They also couldn't buy us out of the new 2 year contract we signed when we got the Fire phones.  But they offered us $100......for everything we have lost.<br/><br/>I am so incredibly disappointed in Amazon.  This is not what I expect from this company. I will warn any one who asks me that they are risking their business and livelihood if they try a Fire Phone.  Don't do it!!! You'll regret it.<br/><br/>I would have only given them 0 Stars, but they coerced a Star our of me
Works great as a phone, text, even data is flawless.  However, the issue is what appears in the carousel without warning.  All of my books were put in the carousel.  The music app constantly appears and mayday has no idea why.  Speakers aren't that great but the system works well using the headset.  The voice assist needs major improvement, but Amazon said they are working to increase the applications ability to do more.  Can't wait.
I love everything Amazon And Ilove My New Phone.
Better than I expected. I can use it for everything mobile
Great phone,! Unlike any I've ever had and super fast too.
Once you figure out how everything works it's pretty nice.
Love my phone, it's the best phone I have ever had so far.
Let me start by saying, for me the phone is nice and well built compared to the first amazon fire 3 years ago. Downside for me is the apps alone, can't get google play and all other google apps, even if you sideload GOOGLE PLAY SERVICE, STORE and all the other pre-requisites.  If I'm amazon i would open this phone for developers, Fire Phone has a potential.
I loved it at first. It has cool gadgets and tricks, but they excitement of having a new phone soon wears off. It had very limited apps and I feel like some thing different stops working each day. First I couldn't send direct messages on Instagram then mute of my apps became incompatible and now the audio Jack only works with their headphones and no speakers. It's getting more and more frustrating and I'm sad that I blew my money.
It’s time to put out the Fire! It makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud is not a strong selling point, especially when competitors like Apple are using 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon can commit to using modern energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.
I love this phone. Does everything I want it to and more.
Amazing phone gives IPhone a run for its money.
I love this phone! Eat your heart out iPhone!!!
Working Great!  Just would like to clear more history. .
It's very responsive and I love how it feels in my hands
Still learning all it can do, but am very happy with it.
It's a cool new phone  v and I love the prime membership
Junk, please save up for a phone worth buying.
I love the finesse of the device and was intrigued by the dynamic perspective but am going to return the device due to the following reasons:<br/>- too less applications in the store (I was originally ready to live with this but it's almost crippling to not have some of the most used apps like google hangouts, gmail, chrome, etc.)<br/>- the immersiveness of games using the dynamic perspective is not as great as I thought it'd be<br/>- hangs in many applications - performance is below average if you are a heavy user (like me) and switch between apps too often<br/>- no incognito mode for the default browser, also can't open more than 10 tabs on the native silk browser<br/>- Whatsapp like applications crash all the time<br/>- most of the gesture based operations "features" are not intuitive and may need some getting used to<br/>- the screen and the back are gorilla glass which is prone to finger prints which I hate and a screen protector is probably the only way out of it<br/>- the device gets too hot if you play any process-intensive game (temple run 2 in my case)<br/>- app drawer does not give ability to sort apps displayed alphabetically<br/>- the native email application is too primitive and inconspicuous<br/>- discharges too quickly, battery is below average for a phone of this hardware configuration<br/>- the firefly is just a gimmick which only helps if you are patient enough and operate in bright light
I wanted to really like this phone but so far it is blah. I Love my kindle fire HDX 8.9. I love amazon and have had prime for several years now and use it several times a month at-least.  I really really was looking forward to this phone and by happy chance I was upgrade eligible a week before it was released. Bought it through the ATT next program. So after a week of having it I report that I miss my android phone.  I miss google play and most especially I miss swiftkey. I REALLY REALLY MISS SWIFTKEY..... Oh well one can hope that in time these things will be added.<br/><br/>On the plus side the phone itself works extremely well and is very loud even in loud situations. It takes really nice pictures. The music player works really really well. It sounds amazing through my skullcandy ear buds. I like that I can scroll just by leaning the phone forward slightly or back slightly.<br/><br/>The cons are the laundry list.<br/>  NO SWIFTKEY or emojicons.<br/>  NO Emojicons<br/>  No Google play. Must use amazon app store, which is missing most of the apps I used everyday.<br/>  No wallpaper or editing the background.<br/>  Changing the ringtones and notifications was not as easy.<br/>  Phone makes it almost impossible to add non Amazon apps. I googled "add zedge to amazon fire phone" and it game me a way to do it. Not easy at all.<br/>  Battery life is no better than 2 year old HTC ONE X. That is very disappointing.<br/>  Cases are hard to find since it is so new. I do recomend the Supacase Unicorn beatle cases. They fit awesome and are not expensive at all.<br/>  Screen size seems smaller than other 4.7in screens. Looks puny next to 5.1 Galaxy S5<br/>All In all I wish I had gone with the Galaxy S5 active. I got that for my son and he loves it and even though our phones are both new I envy his. Now my 65 year old mother has a Galaxy S5 and she said your phone looks so small compared to mine. And honestly the S5 takes better brighter pictures. Oh well in 51 months I can upgrade. hopefully by then Amazon will have listened to its users and added the missing stuff and fixed the bugs.<br/><br/>Did I mention I really really really miss my Swiftkey?
After many years of using only apple phones (all the way back to first one), i decided to try something different.  All the publicity on the fire phone made me want to give it a try, and after 48 hours I have to say I am not happy with this product.  it's very pretty.  In terms of speed from the processor you can't really complain.  Where it fails for me is software.  The amazon software ecosystem just isn't robust enough, which simply puzzles me given how successful droid has been.  I just cannot understand why so many apps that I've used on my iphones I cannot install on this phone because Amazon won't support them even though they can be found in the droid market.  I realize that I can download apk files and work around it, but I don't see why I should have to go through the hassle.  Consequently, my favorite apps from IOS, all of which are available in the droid world, I have to do without.<br/><br/>I am also very dissapointed with battery life.  After 30 minutes (i timed it) of web browsing I lost 10 percent.  I was not expecting such a rapid drain and I use my phones a lot.  I hated my old iphone for poor batter management.<br/>Lastly, just today I found a huge flaw in the speakers.  While watching youtube videos i noticed that in some videos the audio was coming out distorted.  At first I thought maybe the original source audio was bad.  I tried on different devices (tablet and other phone) and sure enough, there was nothing wrong with the original audio signal.  The speakers on my fire phone just can't handle the signal and distort unless I lower the volume.  Mind you, the speakers sound very nice for a phone once I lowered the volume.  But if i have to go through the hassle, what's the point of even having speakers?<br/><br/>My impression is not good.  I really wanted to like this phone.  It has a beautiful screen and just seems cool as hell.  But given the huge pain in the a** software limitations and the mentioned hardware annoyances, I have decided to return it.  The last time I felt this way about an amazon product (kindle fire HD) I decided to just keep it and figured it would just grown on me.  I still dislike it and I most certainly have no intentions of being stuck with a phone that irritates the hell out of me.
I love this phone by far the beat phone I have had yet.
LOVE THE PHONE BUT IT'S BASICALLY AN ANDROID PHONE WITHOUT GOOGLE<br/><br/>I really loved everything about this phone except one thing: It's not an Android phone.<br/><br/>I can't load (or sideload) the Google Play Store or Gmail and I count on Gmail big time.<br/><br/>Only the most popular non-Google apps are on the Amazon App Store, so that limits things tremendously.<br/><br/>If the Amazon email app were as useful or fully synchronized with my Gmail then I would have kept the phone but that was the straw that broke the camels back.<br/><br/>I am returning this today and I feel very sad about that because I really want to promote alternative OSs and I really LOVE LOVE LOVE my Amazon Kindle Fire tablet. I really wanted a phone version of the tablet that I could really use instead of feel like I'm left out because I'm a Gmail user like millions of others out there.<br/><br/>For a smartphone, Gmail IS the killer app and Amazon doesn't have it and doesn't want to get it.
I don't like that you can't change wallpaper.
Well this is my second fire. The first one, the camera stopped working. So now I am on the second one. The sound is not that great for being a digital dolby sound. Music sounds tinny.<br/><br/>When every I try to use my keyboard it jumps around, it not that easy to use. I will be on social media trying to type something and it just jumps back to previous page. I have trouble typing text messages. It jumps around.<br/><br/>The APPS  selection is very poor. i cannot even get redbox. Alot of apps i had on my android I cannot get on amazon apps.<br/><br/>The music selection on prime is GREAT. And the prime for an additional year was great.<br/><br/>I chose this phone over an Iphone 5s and I am really regretting it. My daughter got an iphone at the same time i got my fire and she is so happy with her phone.<br/><br/>I think with a new phone you do have issues, but I think this phone just was not quite ready to be released.<br/><br/>Mayday, well I have used it once and the girl promised when I had my first phone that she would contact me by a certain day and time, No phone call was ever made back Also I was told the developers would need to call me to figure out the problem no call. I took the phone back to AT&T; and they just gave me another phone.<br/><br/>I will not get another fire when get my next phone. I LOVE my kindle fire, I hate my fire phone.
I love it! The phone is lighter, and easy to navigate.
Love it, I couldn't believe I went without this phone.
I'm very pleased with my fire phone!
This Phone didn't even last for 6 months. Apps never worked well, It had so many bugs. Automatically restarts. One of he big problems was 95% of the incoming calls were dropped(It worked good for out going calls). Couple of times phone was troubleshooted remotely by technicians. But the problem continued. the main purpose of the phone is make calls/messages primary features didn't work on this phone.
This New Amazon Fire Phone/Device fits all my needs as a Technician.The bright flash light,and other installed apps help me with my work,as well as the long lasting battery life.It fits perfectly in my hand and its sleak design allows me to easily manage the fire.Cant wait for new upcoming apps to check out.TRhank You Amazon!
Love this phone better than my HTC Windows 8 phone!!!
phone is very fast and smooth and easy to use love it
I would buy one today if it was available on Verizon.
Amazing
Love it
There are features of the phone that I love, but I have problems receiving text from others that have iphones. There were also some issues with learning to navigate through the phone.  It frequently will redial phone numbers, although I have tried to hang up.  I love the kindle feature.  The camera is very good also.  Overall I am pleased and feel that the issues I have will eventually work out.
Didn't Light My Fire ... I think it’s completely unnecessary that many of the Fire's key features, like unlimited cloud photo storage, are supported by Amazon's data centers that are powered by coal and other dirty energy. If Amazon matched competitors like Apple by powering their operations with clean and renewable energy, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.
It was not as easy to navigate through as my HTC 1x.
i like it...it's my very first touch screen phone...
Wish u could more apps like the other Android phones
I love this phone really exceeded my expectations!!!
After a year of having the fire phone,I have never wanted to leave a phone so bad before. At first it was really cool, all the gimmicks on it were entertaining. My first problem was the whole app issue, Google play being untouchable on the phone, limited to only specific apps from Amazon and third party freshman apps that are mostly terrible. No quality checking on third party apps for the store has ensured a slew of really terrible apps.<br/>Now at the year mark, it has seemingly been ignored by Amazon as no real updates to the os have been released, and remains largely buggy and crashes very often. Browsing the timeline on Facebook causes it to crash constantly. Doing simple things will cause the phone to lock up and crash. Very frustrating.<br/>I think amazon knows it would take a lot of work to fix it and not much pay off as I imagine allot of customers have already given it up. So the phone is virtually dead. I think at the least, Amazon learned allot from this and will think twice before releasing any new phone.<br/>I will be paying off what little time I had left for my upgrade to go back to the reliable iPhone stock.<br/>It was an interesting, gimmicky ride at least.
Great phone, I just wish the app market was bigger.
This is by far the best smartphone I have ever had!
Replaced my Iphone with the Fire phone and love it.
I really like this phone! It functions just like a kindle so as a kindle owner it was easy for me to get used to navigating! Most apps that I use have been available and I have been able to download ones that amazon doesn't have yet from external sites. Ive had the phone for over a month now and still like it!
Oh, this was great! This is the first smart phone that actually worked for me.  I love it! Having one button to get to the home screen is an excellent idea.  The phone came complete with my Kindle collection and two pages of applications and yesterday I actually watched a movie on the tv that I downloaded on my Fire phone. Absolutely the best phone I have had.  Thank you Amazon!
It is very interesting seeing opposite review results. 100 five stars and 100 1 star. I think that was because some one felt it hard to transfer from Android phone or iphone.  Here is what I think about the phone:<br/>1. UI design. It was great. Better than any Android and Iphone I have ever seen.  The combination of Carousel  + regular android small icon grid gave me great experience. The carousel reminds me how beautiful a standard app icon should have been. And it listed all regularly used apps. The grids of small icons allows me finding the app I need quickly. Also, I felt a bit surprised seeing someone complained about the "missing" standard app icon grids. They may not realize that they can swipe up the home screen to switch between carousel and grids.<br/>2. Gesture support: I like tilting to open left and right panel. Once getting used to it, I will start doing it all the time even on my wife's iPhone. It was just nice and useful.<br/>3. 3D is great. Just need more apps<br/>4. Battery. it is about the average<br/>5. Sometimes hot, agree but acceptable<br/>6. Load android apps. I just rooted my Galaxy S3 and used it to download apk from google store, then side load the apks to my fire phone. So far so good.
It is a wonderful piece of equipment. Just requires a lot of studying to know how to use it. But it has already gotten me out of a few tough spots. Having the MayDay button for tech support is heavenly. I received outstanding service at the AT&T; store where I purchased it. I believe the agents name was Jose
Love my Kindle Fire and the phone is just as good.
I think it's new and exciting to play around with.
I like the phone, it is a smart phone with big screen, and lots of new cool features.for example when you read a page, it does roll down or up the page according to your eye movement. It has all necessary apps and you can purchase orhers if are not coming free. Overall It is a bargain for its price.
It's a well made phone and I really enjoy firefly
The graphics are amazing and I love the interface
Very happy with this phone and it is easy to use.
Still figuring it out but so far I like it a lot.
I wish this phone focused more on typical "phone" features rather then everything else. As someone who isn't always using WiFi, it's annoying that the updates can ONLY be done via WiFi. Also, I wish I could change the dang wallpaper!
Bought this phone about 6 months ago. Great phone for the price and good battery life once you disable the useless Dynamic perspective feature. Was going to buy additional Fire phones for my family but disappointed that it is no longer available. Gets a 4 star instead of a 5 due to many of the apps I normally use are not available through the Amazon app store.
I love the ability to immediately shop at the Amazon site and utilize my prime benefits. The phone lags behind in its Android like capabilities. The app store needs much improvement. My first device crashed before it hit its first year anniversary. If it hadn't been for my prime benefits and my kindle unlimited membership, I would have opted for another phone.
I love this phone! I like that it's set up a lot like my kindle fire tablet. I love the access to my Amazon apps and shopping. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the battery doesn't last as long as I would like when using the apps. Otherwise, it's a great phone and the price was much less than the other smart phones I had considered buying.
I really wanted to love this phone but the apps fir everyday use just aren't there. I miss them! Life was so easy when everything was right on my phone. I assumed they would be. I almost returned the phone, I really wish I had. The phone seems more for kids as most of the apps are games.
I have now had the phone for 4 months. Here is my review thus far:<br/>PROS:<br/>-Does basic, necessary phone functions (i.e. call and text) sufficiently<br/>-Lightweight yet seemingly durable. I'm not one to drop my phone often or have other accidents, but the phone has survived the few drops I have had without any visible damage<br/>-Headphones that come with it are awesome; significantly more comfortable and better sound quality than the ones Apple provides<br/>-Camera's picture quality is very good when it wants to be<br/>-Was expecting the Firefly to be a gimmick and not very effective, but has actually been a pretty neat and semi-useful feature for song, show, and product identification<br/>-Longer battery life than what I  am generally accustomed to<br/>-Added year of Prime<br/>CONS:<br/>-Dynamic perspective is a gimmick and entirely pointless. Also, will completely destroy battery life so I have it turned off<br/>-Phone will fail to notify me of missed calls, new texts, and voicemails (there is discrepancy between Amazon and AT&T; over who's at fault for the voicemail issue. I spoke with both companies, and each one blames the other)<br/>-Web browser has been quite slow as of late, failing to load pages and has difficulty playing videos. Also, browser often will not modify the web-page to fit the screen which would be fine if it would allow me to scroll left and right, but it often does not<br/>-Camera is incredibly inconsistent. There are times it is great, but often the auto-focus does not work properly causing blurry photos. This inconsistency has rendered the "quick-snap" button on the side of the phone, almost pointless.<br/>-Linking accounts, such as Gmail and Amazon, for contacts displays multiple, duplicate contacts with the same name and number which is incredibly annoying. You have to manually choose which account you want your contact list to correspond with in order to minimize said duplicate contacts. It would be nice to see them auto-integrate.<br/>-Phone force closes apps too often<br/>-If your battery is low, it will constantly let you know with a vibrate and big pop-up display. For example, yesterday my phone hit 15% while I wasn't on it so it vibrated. I checked the phone and saw that was the notification so I closed the pop-up and began using my phone. About 10 seconds later, it notified me again; I close the pop-up, continue using my phone, and about 30 seconds later, it notified me AGAIN. Worst part is, I contacted Amazon and they said there is no way (as of now) to modify the battery's notification settings.<br/>-App store not as extensive as Google Play or Apple. This isn't too big of an issue because you can side-load missing apps onto the phone, but this puts you at risk for downloading viruses, and the apps you do download won't auto-update; you have to search for updated versions. (Missing apps that I would like to see in the Amazon App Store: YouTube, Snapchat, Adobe Reader, and Google Maps)<br/>-My device requires a restart/shutdown once a day to continue running smoothly; if not, phone will freeze or become annoyingly glitchy/slow at some point<br/><br/>Conclusion: Don't choose this phone. I'm a huge Amazon fan, so I wanted to like this phone, but I just can't. There are much better devices out there to choose from. They aren't going to be at the 99 cent price point like the Fire, but you are likely to be more satisfied spending the extra $100 or so for a superior device.
Really terrible faulty phone, I have gone through two of them since summer. I have never damaged either phone, even had a leather Amazon case.bthe problem was after charging a few times the phone rasonly decided it wouldn't boot, it would turn on but I'd be stuck on the screen that says fire and it wouldn't stsrt up properly and take me to the screen with the icons. To add insult to injury with the second phone I couldn't even factory reset and wipe all data, as the phone arrived with an up volume button that didn't work. Factory reset is tricky and involves pressing power on button and up volume button at same time..it takes careful timing also and many attempts. So this phone just randomly decides it won't start up properly and you will be left without a working phone, if you can factory reset you can wipe all your photos and contacts to get it to work again... Even after that it wouldn't restart for me. I love Amazon and am a long time customer but this phone os faulty. What I think is great is Amazin customer service and I will continue to shop with Amazon. However I made the mistake of buying this phone through ATT Next on their website, well when I told them I had already gone through two faulty phones they wanted me to pay over $500 balance in order to own the Amazon phone and leave ATT or receive a y2k flip phone and continue to pay I stall nets through February 2016 for an Amazon fire phone that is faulty and can't be trusted... Ie they wanted my money for providing no phone and no service. I am disgusted with them and having to take this to the attorney general. ATT kept referring me to Amazon telling me to call them, acting as if they were not the vendor, passing the buck. I did that before and got a replacement faulty phone with someone else's name on it. I can't risk not being contactable by my sons school or my job again, the fire phone just won't turn one day, can't risk that again. My advice don't buy this phone but don't be put off Amazon, they are great. ATT aare thieves who offer zero service and expect you to call Amazon yourself, they want you to pay for a phone that doesn't even turn on and refuse to accept responsibility. Bottom line the Amazon phone is faulty and ATT expect the customer to take the loss for that be out of pocket instead of them.
I rarely write Amazon reviews, which is a shame because I am generally very pleased with Amazon services and products. However, I cannot say the same about the Fire Phone. An avid supporter of Amazon, I made the mistake of purchasing this phone the day in came out, as I was desperately trying to replace my iPhone and the timing was right. Huge mistake.<br/><br/>Although the phone immediately got negative reviews, I held out for awhile because I liked some features, like the high quality camera and the Firefly service. However, after about 6 months with the phone, it has already slowed down considerably, and the high quality camera isn't really worth anything since it takes about 10 seconds to open, far too long to take a photo at an opportune time. The Silk (or whatever tf the internet app is called) app crashes constantly, edited pictures take 2+ minutes to save, the battery is pitiful, etc, etc.<br/><br/>By far the worst part of this phone is its incompatibility with anything. I mistakenly thought that the phone ran Android, or would at least be compatible with Android apps, but I was very wrong. There are very few apps I'm interested available on this phone. At first it wasn't a huge deal; so what if I couldn't get SnapChat. It's not like it's something I really need. But there are certain apps lacking from the store that I can't handle. My boyfriend is spending 7 months studying in Beijing, and none of the services or apps available through the Great Firewall are compatible with the Fire Phone, even an app with a huge network of users like WeChat.<br/><br/>To top this off, since I, being a loyal Amazon customer, purchased the phone the day it came out, I paid full price for it. I should have waited, because after it completely bombed the price dropped around 70% only a month later. Now I am stuck with this POS phone I invested a ton of money in. I truly regret not getting a Samsung or Nexus or other Android phone. Honestly I would rather have stuck with my terrible iPhone, but alas, it is too late now.<br/><br/>I am extremely disappointed, Amazon.
I'm giving the Fire Phone 3 stars as of now.  I bought the Fire because my iPhone 5 screen basically exploded.  At the time I couldn't afford a new phone outright and when my screen broke the back case was also damaged so it was not cost effective to repair.  Being an avid Amazon user with a Fire HD and a prime account I knew about the Fire Phone.  I loved my Apple but always was curious to try something a bit different.  The one thing that kept me tethered to the iPhone was iTunes, but Amazon made it easy to transfer my library to the Amazon music player.  So I took the leap and got the Fire, as a matter of fact my wife did too.  Now a couple months into owning it, and having the new gadget euphoria wear off, I think it is time for a review.<br/><br/>Cosmetically this phone is the best out there.  Period.  It looks and feels far more durable than any iPhone I have owned.  The only phone that would beat it in durability would probably be my old Nokia brick from about 1997.  That literally survived being run over but there wasn't much in the way of apps for it.  The phone is sleek and sturdy and has the right amount of heft to it.  Now that I got that part out of the way..on to functionality.<br/><br/>The music player..well, after transferring my iTunes library to the Amazon player a lot of my songs wouldn't migrate.  That isn't the phone's fault..that is the stupid DRM that Apple used to include on EVERYTHING.  Gotta find an easy way to strip that junk out so I can load my ENTIRE library.  Anyways, onwards...the music app is itself meh.  No the one thing they need to do to it is make it possible to have it always list your music by artist.  Yes, you can change it for that immediate use, but whenever you open the app again it always defaults to organizing by album name.  I'm sorry, but 99% of the time I have no clue what the name of the album is, but I KNOW who the artist is.  Organizing by artist should be the default, or at least give us a way to change the default to artist, not album.  Also..every other time I go to change songs or whatever the Amazon version of Siri opens up and kills my music.  Why is this happening?  Annoying to the max.<br/><br/>The silk browser..if you have a Kindle Fire you know how it goes.  It's a pretty nice browser, decent speed, and I've only found a few websites that just plain don't work on it.<br/><br/>Now...the Facebook app.  I don't know if these issues are to do with the phone or the app but damn...would it be so hard to put a 'Close' button on the corner of a picture or video?  The stupid swipe thing to get out of a picture took me a few days to learn, and honestly, it's stupid because you have to swipe just right or the picture won't close.  So you look like a fool swiping the crap out of a picture, like you're stroking it or something.  Just put in a close button and fix that nonsense.<br/><br/>The Firefly button...for the love of God eliminate that thing on future versions.  I am so sick of inadvertently pushing it.  It is absolutely maddening when I'm listening to music in the car and go to lock the screen and the stupid firefly crap fires up.  Just leave it as an icon on the screen and eliminate that button.<br/><br/>Overall the phone is ok.  It's not awesome.  I wanted it to be awesome, the wife and I are the only people we know that even have it and most people never even heard of it.  It has some bugs, it is a tad slow, especially on start up.  It will bog down and get a bit jumpy on occasion.  But it is built well and looks great.  I wish Amazon would open some sort of direct line with Fire Phone owners so we can report bugs and recommend fixes.  Oh..and good luck looking up issues about the phone.  Since everything Amazon sells is labeled Fire you will be sorting through thousands of articles related to the Kindle before you find one that is relevant to the phone.<br/><br/>Update 3/14/15:  Ok, now that I've REALLY had to live with this phone I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt, don't bother.  Really.  The bugs in this phone couldn't be killed by the best of exterminators.  This thing locks up, is slow, doesn't do what you want it to do, has HORRIBLE bluetooth music streaming, the screen will randomly turn on even though you never touched it, the stupid camera turns on by itself, that firefly button becomes even more infuriating as time goes on, and the lock/power button decides when it wants to work.  And today it decided that the top half of the screen wasn't a touchscreen anymore.  You know, the half that has the phone, email, text messaging, and facebook apps.  So the phone rendered itself useless and required three restarts to get it working again, which was a whole bunch of fun itself (did I mention the lock screen/power button decides when it wants to work?).  So yeah..really I wanted to love you, I would have settled for just liking you, but Fire Phone, I can't even put you in the friend zone now.  You suck.  I wish I never left Apple and as soon as I'm eligible I will be running back to the iPhone.
Operating system and Firmware updates have fixed most of my earlier complaints about this phone. I can't tell you if the proximity detection is fixed, since I don't dare put a screencover back on it and risk not being able to answer the phone again. I will just have to live with it and hope Amazon was right in their faith with the Gorilla glass not needing any extra protection.<br/><br/>2 week update<br/>The longer I have it the more issues I have and software updates seem to bring more problems than they fix. I can not remember ever being so disgusted with a phone's performance after just 2 weeks, that I am actually thinking about paying the penalty to return it .<br/><br/>I need to rescind my statement that this was at least a good mini tablet for watching Amazon Prime, since with the last software update, the prime video app will no longer open ( Netflix works great though and will now stream from fire phone to any of our Tivo, Roku boxes) , and since it is a built in OS app I can not even uninstall/reinstall it to see if that would fix it.<br/><br/> There is good reason they pay you $250 ( $99 free year of prime , $25 amazon coin for app , $150 from AT&T; for adding another line) to beta test this phone for them.<br/> It seems the "no way to disable the screen shutting off during a call" was an intentional feature , since the screen detects any screen protector as your cheek if you are on a call. It is nice of Amazon to put so much faith in their Gorilla Glass that they make it so you can not use a screen protector with their phone. Yes I have the official Amazon approved screen protector, the same style I have used on my SG4 and am 100% positive have saved me many a busted screen.<br/><br/>On the bright side the hotspot streaming was put to the test yesterday and worked flawlessly all day, once I found the setting to stop it from going into battery save and shutting off every 15-30 minutes.<br/><br/>If you are in the market for a better than free phone, then go ahead and get yourself a firephone. If you are looking for a nice high end alleged $500 phone, than stick with an HTC or Galaxy and stay as far away from these one off of a one off phones as you can.<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>***********************************************************************************************************<br/><br/>If you are looking for a 4G mini tab to watch videos on while on the go, than by all mean go ahead and get yourself a fire phone. However if you actually use your phone for strange things like actually making phone calls, than you should really consider sticking with a more experienced brand like Samsung or dare I say Apple.<br/><br/> While Amazon's fire OS may be great for their Fire HD tablets and I have no issues there, they really missed the mark when they attempted to bring it to a phone.If they had actually left it alone and the phone actually had the same UI I would've been a lot happier. I have had my Fire phone for almost 2 weeks, and I have yet to figure out how to not have the screen shut off during a phone call, this is a MAJOR FLAW when I need to actually access the keypad to enter an extension number or even disconnect a call because the person did not answer, I am finished leaving a voicemail.<br/><br/> The tip the phone, flip your wrist to access the menus may be a great gimmick, but is useless in real world application, give me back my menu button, allow me to just go back to me previous app without having to hit the sole (home) button and reopening it, even if it does reopen to where I left off. Open a link in an email, swipe to go back, no you do not go back to your email, you go back to the previous page in the browser history at the link you clicked in your email yesterday.<br/><br/> While the "virtual 3d" HDX display is great for watching Amazon Prime movies, it does not play well with a lot of games, even those purchased and loaded through Amazon App store. Several of my games just keep bouncing around ,zooming in/out making them impossible to play on the phone, these are not high def games, these are just simple games like Despicable me and Megapolis.<br/> If switching from Android with Google+ games to Fire OS beware that Amazon games will not import or allow you to sync your Google+ game ID, so you will be forced to start over again ,or keep your old tablet/phone just for your old games, even if the game is available to play in Amazon.
I purchased my phone directly through AT&T; and received it yesterday afternoon. Upon pulling it out of the box and playing around with the cool features, I was pleasantly surprised on how many neat features this phone has! I did not and still have not had any issues with flicking my wrist to pull up the side menus like others have said. It works great for me. They do say to "flick" your wrist, not "casually move your wrist to the side". I was a little disappointed in the battery life though. I was opening every app yesterday, downloading things and just playing around in general, so I assumed that's why my battery was going so quickly, but then today I noticed the same issue. I immediately e-mailed them inside the help section and got a response immediately about an update that I was unaware of. This update is supposed to fix the battery issue. I honestly even can't complain about the battery too much because my previous iPhone 4 (that I owned for about a year) had terrible battery life after the first few months! Also, I have not had an issue with my phone being hot to the touch and I used it constantly for a few hours last night trying to figure it all out.<br/>I tried out the firefly features on a song and a book and it worked perfectly both times!<br/>This phone is different than what I'm used to. I was an iPhone user for over 4 years, so some things will take some getting used to, but that's to be expected.<br/>There IS a way to close the apps running in the background. I've seen a lot of complaining about this. Go to your carousel, hold your finger down over the icon in your carousel and a drop down box will appear, and you can remove it from your carousel from there. Simple, but I figured that out on my own.<br/>One thing I really miss is being able to take a screen shot. Now, since I only got my phone yesterday, I don't know if this option is available or not, but I have not been able to figure it out. I haven't contacted mayday about it because it's not a huge issue and I'm not going to bother those people for a simple question. If I have to contact them for any other reason, I will ask about that.<br/>Apps...I am a bit disappointed in the selection of apps available. This is a brand new phone though, and as fast as they seem to be moving to improve things, I expect that many apps will appear available very quickly! One that I use often is NCP. I am a National Consumer Panel member. You simply use an app to scan your purchases and ear points towards rewards. NCP has an agreement with AT&T;, so as an active member, I save money on my cell phone bill. I'm not sure why this app is unavailable, but I will be contacting someone reguarding this issue so I can continue my membership with them.<br/>Overall, I believe this is an amazing phone and if people would give it a little bit of time, I think they would realize that amazon is working quickly to resolve a lot of issues. Just like any BRAND NEW phone, it's going to have some issues and kinks that need to be worked out. I am tired of seeing all these reviews that didn't even give the phone a chance. If time goes on (and by time I mean months) and this phone doesn't improve or gets worse, i will edit my review to let others know, but I believe in amazon!<br/>I have been an amazon prime mom member for about 6 months now, but I have been an amazon fan for years now. I have a 3 year old daughter that is 11 months older than my twin boys. My husband works a lot of long hours, so getting out to shop isn't easy for me. Amazon has been an incredible convenience for me and my family! I will stand by this company's side! Their customer service has always been incredible and they deserve the benefit of the doubt!!
Love the phone. Please get more top rated apps.
I am really enjoying getting acquainted with my new Fire phone. It's my first smartphone ever, and it has been extremely easy for me to figure out how everything works. I've been pretty much addicted to it for the past few days.
I tried it out...... Please please add google play store. Amazon app store is horrible. Till this is done i will stick with my Samsung Note. I want you Amazon to be my everything company. Your sucky phone app store is preventing me from loving you and making you my everything........
Update: Ok now I really dislike this phone.  I thought I could reduced my stars, but apparently I had already given it one star.  It is really sad when Amazon does not care if their own phone can support Amazon Underground.  That is really sad. This was my first smart phone and I choose poorly.  I will have to look into a refurbished android since this is under contract until next year.  If Amazon has given up than I have too.  I looked forward to the app of the day and now I can not even do that according the person I spoke with.<br/><br/>I loved my Fire phone.  To me it was the minivans of phones.  Ok that is not attractive at all, but I am a mom and I shop a lot on Amazon and my kids and I love(d) my kindle so this seemed like a good next step for me.  I did not have another smart phone before this so there is not a lot I miss from other providers since I have not looked a lot on Googles or Apple apps site to see what I could have had.  This being said I loved my phone until their apps starting taking center stage on my carousel.  I do not mind having Amazon shopping apps on my phone because I have just decided to hide the ones I do not use in a collection for apps I do not want.  What has broken the camels back is the the music app from Amazon has taken on a mind of its own and is constantly on my carousel and I have to keep removing it.  I have been told this is a feature of this app which does not look like it will be changed any time soon.  This was not the case until the last week or so.  I woke up one morning and there it was and there is has remained despite removing it several times a day.  This is where I draw the line.  I do not Amazon apps I do not care about front and center on my carousel.  I have a contract so I guess I have another year and a half to see what other items they decided I need to see every day.  I am a afraid of what is to come in the next year and a half.  Will other apps show up which are permanent figures on my carousel?  Am I only going to be able to have Amazon apps on my carousel?  I would have given the phone 4 stars based on how I use it and the features I purchased it for but I am glad I waited to write my review.  If this feature is permanent this may be my last Fire phone.
I got my amazon for Christmas, love it so far.
Love this phone the pictures are so life like.
I love it!! Couldn't be happier with my phone.
Does dumb stuff sometimes But what phone Don't
Love this new phone and all the cool features.
Rating of one star due to this phone being discontinued. I was planning on buying one for my son soon, and a new one for myself, and passing my current fire phone on to my younger daughter. Now, if I want one, I'll have to try my luck with eBay. Not happy at all. Bring it back!
The Fire could be MUCH better.I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and
The apps and the smartphone part of the phone work flawlessly however, the actual phone needs to be improved.  The microphone doens't seem to work as well as other phones.  It's difficult to hear and the quality of the audio is poor.  my wofe sounds like she's underwater half the time.  Great phone, just need to work on the actual phone part.
I don"t like that there's no back button.
I love the phone. Just learning how it works.
I am enjoying using it. It has most of the benefits of other expensive phones at affordable price, But many android apps are not compatible with this phone. I don't install much apps. But currently, I am badly in need of research apps like 'research highlights', 'browzine' etc. 'browzine' is compatible with kindle but not with fire phone :(
I have had a slide phone for years. This is my first experience with a smart phone. I have had a Kendle Fire for about two years and loved it. So it was natural for me to choose the Fire Phone when I saw the poster at the ATT store. I am enjoying the ease of using it. Lots of crazy New apps and the old ones are still there for me to access.
I wanted so much to like this phone. I purchased it based on my experience with Amazon as a prime member and avid shopper.<br/><br/>LACK OF APPS APPS APPS. Maybe the commercial with the 9 year old kids, should have been the hint, this phone does not have adult apps for a business professional. I.E. STARBUCKS APP YES PEOPLE NO STARBUCKS APP, NO BANK APPS, CAN'T USE WITH DIRECT TV APP. WTH? YES THERE ARE TONS OF GAME APPS. The phone's APPS are for Kids, I have NEVER met any 9 year old with the phone, there's a reason they keep showing kids using this phone in the commercials. It's looking like I will be handing this over to a 12 year old.<br/>I can not express the lack of vision on Amazons part to put this phone out to market without any regard to the APPS that are in the upper market. DO YOUR research to see what APPS were the most downloaded for over 25. I now have to use a Starbucks card. Which has affected my Starbucks experience, I have not used a card for Starbucks in years.  This has affected my account with ATT, since I can't just return it and get a real phone for an adult who uses the phone for business.  So I will be out another $300 bucks to change my account to<br/>Battery Life less than 6 hours unplugged and all apps closed. Maybe this technology eats up the battery. If I listen to music and read emails with 99% (it's rare the phone charges to 100%) Within 30 mins I am down to 75-85%battery life. With advanced power management technology. Also, when you charge the battery, the plug is VERY sensitive, sometimes it just stops charging all together.
Unlock for 199 is a good deal $449 is pure ripoff their marketing team is insane to keep increasing the price on the unlocked version of this phone. Especially after doing some research and finding out that their per unit manufacturing costs aren't even close to $80.
Bought it as a music/tablet/gps replacement.
Features are very poor and a lot of glitches
I love this phone  just as good as an IPhone
Love my new phone, wish I'd found it sooner!
Love it, Mayday service great, very pleased.
I, too, wanted to love my Fire phone.  Unfortunately, it's been a huge disappointment.  The abysmal battery life and the constant, and I do mean constant, rebooting really overshadow any positive functionality.  I've used the Mayday feature a couple of times but get disconnected because the operating system apparently can't handle the activity.  The Amazon rep even made an appointment with me to address the issue but was a "no-show".  Never heard from them again.  Any time I try to open a link through social media or from the Silk browser, the phone reboots.  That happens roughly 95% of the time.  That's irritating.  What's scary and truly bothers me is when the phone reboots when trying to access the phone function.  It happens often enough that I am concerned about trying to use it in an emergency situation.  It takes minutes, not seconds, for the phone to cycle through multiple reboots.<br/><br/>As I said, these issues far outweigh the cutesy (and admittedly enticing) features like Firefly and Prime music.<br/><br/>The numerous surveys that I've responded to with these concerns outlined may one day yield results.  I'm not holding my breath though.  I am left holding a crappy phone.
In all the phone is great. It does what a phone supposed to do make call, texts and etc. Only thing it lack s is apps which is not a deal breaker. What made it a sweet deal was Amazon give you free one year worth of Amazon prime. The phone has like a 3d feel to it. For instance the screen reacts to hand or head movement.
I wanted to love it but it just has too many issues.<br/>First the positive:<br/>1. Their version of "siri" is a lot better.  She actually understands what you are asking 99% of the time<br/>2. Sturdy and tough.  I don't use a case and don't feel like a need it.<br/>3. The dynamic screen is cool.<br/><br/>The negative:<br/>1. You can't increase the small text size on texts.  You can for email.<br/>2. Half the time I won't get notifications for phone calls and/or voice mails. The only way I'll get them is when I go to that app to make a phone call and THEN it will pop up that I have all these missed calls.<br/>3. You can't get a lot of common apps, for ex. Target cartwheel<br/>4. Huge learning curve. Things are hard to figure out and when I use the mayday help, usually they don't have an answer for me. I'll end up figuring it out after researching myself. For ex., I switched from an iphone and called to see how to transfer my contacts over. Mayday told me there was no way to do it.  It turns out there is an AT&T; app that was super easy to transfer them over. If I had listened to Mayday, I would have spend days manually entering contacts.<br/><br/>Basically, it looks pretty and cool but I'm really regretting switching from iphone and now I'm stuck with it for 2 years because I got the At&T; 2 year contract to make it free.  I would have been REALLY upset if I had actually paid for it.  I now just use this phone for texting and the occasional call and use my ipad for everything else.
First smart phone with big learning curve.
It's a great phone got it for my daugther.
I enjoy the Fire phone. Some fun features.
Really enjoying this phone, great features
I love everything about this phone --before it even arrived at my house.  I ordered it while I was still watching, well, watching the report of the rollout as I couldn't see the live stream.<br/><br/>The 3D graphics are amazing.  The maps are better than anything I have seen before.  I have had maps with representations of buildings and landmarks but they were always difficult to maneuver and understand.<br/><br/>MAYDAY is here!  This is truly a device that has everything.  Every time I open a new screen, there are new things to discover.  LOL, Amazon, you put delivery information above missed calls.<br/><br/>I did not understand Firefly from the video – not until I had it in hand.  It identifies things like books-DVDs-movies-barcodes when you point your phone and hold the camera button.  This is amazing.  The camera is also superior.  I have missed a million snapshots while trying to open my screen and then launch camera.<br/><br/>The Fire is completely interactive, especially for those us of who are not high tech on our own.  I love the right tilt and the left tilt to open the panels.  That is just amazing.  Anyone who has ever sat there stabbing at one of those pull up menus on a Kindle Fire will be amazed.  I could sit here tilting all day.  It is like the difference between the old Nintendo controllers and the new wii controllers – a new world entirely.<br/><br/>There is so much that is amazing about this phone!  The most important part is that it has everything!  This is everything a tablet and a phone and a music player should be.<br/><br/>Two things make me sad:  I am sorry the carousel has reappeared.  The second is the ONLY flaw and this is the same flaw I have with almost every other phone than my Note, is the size of it.  I love sleek but I also love a screen I can type on.<br/><br/>Oh, and it gets hot.  But then it would, wouldn’t it?
Although I am still learning how to use some features, I like the phone very much.  The size is good.  The biggest complaint that I have is that it is far more fragile than any other smartphone that I have had.  (The corner of my husbands phone cracked in his pocket when he bent over.)  But overall I like the phone.
Overall, it's everything a teen/near college student will want. The only thing I can complain about is that it doesn't really come with the 1000 amazon coins that it said it would. When I tried to fixed the problem or at least see what's up with that, using Mayday, the man made me pay for the coins with my own money
I have a Amazon Fire tablet which is my favorite go to for things to look up. Then I thought to my self this would be cool if it was a phone. But then amazon came out with phone just like a tablet and the things I do on my phone automatically sync to my tablet how cool is that that's why I gave it a five-star!
This is better then the iPhone's
Based on the price and and one year of amazon prime is the best phone. Battery last more than enough. Really responsiveness. Great display. Camera is good and hardware very resistant. Homescreen respond great for the price. Now if you want to ne ahead of the game in technology pay for another overprice phone.
Using the speakerphone on calls, could be a little louder.. I also miss my speech enabled ability to announce calls ands text messages as well as the ability to read messages... Those are just things I miss, although I am getting familiar with the fire phone and I love it minus the mentioned mishaps above...
Did not like it at all no good reseption
Not quite as big as my LG but still nice
GIVE US MORE APPS OR GOOGLE PLAY PLEASE!
Needs more apps everything else is great
I love my Kindle Fire. I wanted to love the Fire Phone. Within 36 hours, I had decided to return it.<br/><br/>The screens freeze a lot.<br/><br/>You cannot delete multiple people out of the contact lists. One app did supposedly, but everyone I follow on Twitter shows up when I scroll thru to find someone to call.<br/><br/>Deleting 2000 people one at a time is necessary for above problem because the book is so huge it won't download with my car's Bluetooth to be able to hands free call.<br/><br/>There's no easy way to pin apps for easy access that I figured out off the bat.<br/><br/>There are too many steps to check to see if you have  notifications if you turn the sound off.<br/><br/>It times out about half the time when looking up a web page.<br/><br/>You are supposed to be able to sideload Android apps not in the Amazon app. Haven't been successful not being routed thru the Google play store. The Fire doesn't like the store and store won't recognize the phone.<br/><br/>Instagram won't recognize my Twitter account.<br/><br/>I don't need to see Candy Crush recommendations as I scroll across most used apps because it's consumer focused with recommendations under every icon.<br/><br/>I like the Firefly feature in theory, but it's not necessary.<br/><br/>The dynamic perspective is cool.<br/><br/>I still haven't figured out the purpose of 5 forward facing cameras, but you can do panoramic shots.
Really sharp graphics and great basic apps that come with the phone. I love the firefly app and it takes really nice pictures. Only complaint is that the battery drains fast but it just means I have to get used to keeping it charged up.
Once you get used to it it works great.
It's a fun phone. I love the music app!
Good phone, good camera, nice features.
So far it is a good phone. The software and sound are good. My phone does not run hot, as others have claimed that is does. On the fence on wether to go back to my Android simply because the Apps are better through the google store.
This is a great phone. I've had it for just over a month and there have been no problems at all. Easy to use, nice clear screen, and it takes a beautiful picture. My only complaint is that I can't get all the apps I had on my old Samsung phone. Other than that, I am very satisfied with the phone
I was skeptical about getting this at first due to the lack of Google apps but Amazon has made up for it with beautifully simple and elegant replacement apps, including a Maps app with the nicest GPS voice and interface I've seen.<br/><br/>It's brimming innovation with the new, more convenient swipe up motion instead of the standard Android back button, the peek feature where by slightly tilting the phone, you can see more details on things (which are otherwise nicely hidden), and two side menus which you can swipe out or tilt to see.<br/><br/>The 3D effect works amazingly well and Firefly works much better for reading contact info off paper than the Optical Reader app on my old Galaxy S4.<br/><br/>It's also built well (feels good to hold) and is the first Android phone I've owned which feels as as smooth as the iPhone.
BUY  THIS IT'S AWESOME SO COOL
Generally, I'm impressed.  I love the SOS feature.  I've had smart phones since they were introduced, and did not realize how helpful that would be.  There are a few App available in the Google Store, not offered on the Amazon store.  Would highly encourage Amazon to make them interchangeable.
I purchased my 32 gb AT&T; Fire Phone off eBay for $125 which included a free year of prime.  Such a deal I thought.  It came with an unlock code.  I was pretty impressed with the phone and fiddled around with it a lot and could compare some of the features to my Fire HD6.  I also have an iPhone and a Nokia Windows Lumia 521 so it had some things that were similar.<br/><br/>I wanted to get a prepaid MVNO plan for the Fire after going to AT&T; and finding out how much their monthly prepaid plans cost!  While AT&T; advertises a $2 a day only when used plan - it's important to know it's $10 a month regardless - so if you use the phone 5 days in a month the 6th day on will cost an additional $2 a day.  Since the Fire Phone has a hotspot included I had a heck of a time finding a cheap prepaid plan that would allow that feature.  This is not going to be my main phone - it's basically a backup phone.<br/><br/>Ok -  I finally found Consumer Cellular which is technically not a prepaid plan but there is not an activation fee or sim card charge and you can even get an AARP discount.  I like it cause you can mix and match your minutes and your text/date.  I really want to take advantage of the hotspot/tether feature when traveling and do not have wifi access.  Whatever.<br/><br/>Ok so I had to insert a different sim in the phone to unlock it.  Since I did not have a nano sim that was not AT&T;  I cut down an old T-Mobile sim -  filed it a little as it was too thick.  However - and HERE is why I am giving this phone 2 starts..... I could not get the (insert F word here) sim tray to pop open to get the AT&T; include sim out.  This phone did not come with the sim ejector tool.  I fiddled and fiddled with a paper clip and finally got it to pop open.  However each time I tried to open the sim tray it took forever and I bent paperclips doing it - just could not find the right spot or use the right pressure.<br/><br/>So today I received a nano sim from a prepaid AT&T; provider and it came with a nifty sim ejector tool.  I used the sim ejecter tool BUT it broke inside the sim hole.  Thus I could not open the sim tray period.<br/><br/>So I called Amazon who usually has excellent customer service and explained my situation - after explaining it again and again and getting across the fact a paperclip would not fit in the hole because it has the piece of the sim injector tool inside (sigh) - I am getting a replacement phone.<br/><br/>I guess my biggest complaint is surely I am not the only one who had problems opening the sim tray "oh it's simple just use a paperclip" - well I think it is a big defect in that it is not that easy to do (or is it me - comments will be read).  And the sim it came with - couldn't even be used even if I had wanted to get AT&T; - as the AT&T; store said I had to use one of theirs - not the one it came with - which didn't help matters either.<br/><br/>Regardless for $26 it is a pretty cool phone I think.  You don't have to use iTunes to get your music on it.  You can use an app and drag apk files to the download folder on it.  By the way I have tried to use googled instructions for the Google Play store and the only way I could get that app to work was after installing the service and store apk's - I would be able to download one app - then the store wouldn't work so I would have to reinstall a those apks and reboot and then I could download another app - this of course was a PITA - not worth it except it was the only way I could get the magic jack apk to work.  Hope some of this info is useful.  But yes it is a great phone - excellent camera - if you paid $400 or no - not so much.
Great
Overall, I feel this is a really great phone, if you're not going to use a smartphone for much. I actually liked the way it feels, the way it's set up, the look of the screen and pictures/camera/video clearnes is great. As well as the fact that if you're an amazon member already, most of your things just pop up on the phone once you log in to your account. I also love the 3d graphics on the lock screen. I absolutely love to watch video on it and listen to music, I have to say that it has great sound. I also seriously love the headphones, which will hopefully be available seperately and in more colors because I would definitely buy more. Another plus is that it has 32 GB.<br/><br/>What I didn't like is the fact that I can not access certain apps, that I really depend on (train/bus tracker), properly. Now this may be the fault of android technology itself or the app, but I honestly found an iphone to be a lot easier to access anything on. The Fire phone is easy to navigate through but because of its size & heaviness, I find myself fumbling with it when I try to use it with one hand. Also, I may have gotten a defective phone because it turns itself off at times (but it does restart on its own which is nice), it gets really hot, and all of a sudden I get voicemails when it's right in front of me and I could have answered the call, but it just didn't even ring.<br/><br/>I was debating between 3-4 stars, but the phone does work well overall, and I did pay a bit over a dollar for it so for that amount, I wasn't surprised that the phone is a bit defective. I have to honestly say though, that I have no idea if I am going to keep the phone as I miss a few of the apps that function better on the iphone. In the end, the Fire phone is really not bad for it being the first Amazon smartphone.
This is the Amazon phone you are looking for! Does everything Amazon which is great consider I have Kindle. This review will constantly be updated.  If you find this helpful, please press Yes below.<br/><br/>My profile: Heavy gadget users for personal and business purposes. I use my phone (Galaxy S5) quite a bit for personal use and iPhone 5 for work<br/><br/>I have the following and/or used the following before:<br/><br/>1) iPhone 5<br/>2) Galaxy S5<br/>3) Galaxy S3<br/>4) Wife's Moto X<br/>5) Galaxy Nexus<br/>6) Nexus One<br/>7) iPhone 3GS<br/><br/>I've been through many devices and also Kindle Fire Tablets. This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year. I will provide a detail comparison between the smartphones I use and a little bit of Kindle Fire comparison (which uses similar OS).<br/><br/>Spec (8/10):<br/><br/>For Amazon first attempt, this is a very decent phone.  It has the speed of my wife's Moto X but not where it is for Galaxy S5.  However, this phone is built much differently for different purpose.  It's an "experience" phone rather than a "spec" phone.  Like an iPhone or Moto X, it provides a very tight experience to its Fire OS without needing any of the raw power that you get from Galaxy S5 to please you.  It's a phone that does "just enough" for all the things the OS is capable of doing for you<br/><br/>Screen (9/10):<br/>This screen is very nice.  At 720p, it may not have the clarity of the Galaxy S5 but beats the iPhone 5.  Video on this is crisp.  Running 720p content is absolutely fabulous on this device and no shadowing whatsoever.<br/><br/>Sound(8/10):<br/>The sound system in this Fire Phone is Digital Dolby Plus. This means lots of virtualization of sound and a good pair of earphones wlil help you go through your tracks.  Quality is on par with Galaxy S5 for low bitrate soundtrack but at higher bitrate, the Galaxy S5 maybe better with the 24-bit/192kHz DAC built in that the Fire Phone is lacking.  The earphone that comes with the device is very clever with magnetic pad to stick the earphones together and reduce tangle.<br/><br/>Build & Styling (7/10):<br/><br/>This Fire Phone is a sturdy piece of brick.  Yes, a brick I said because there's not much styling to it.  It's like holding a phone from 2010. Styling is more inline with the Nexus 4 with Glass back and the iPhone 3GS with round side.  People may think you are holding some cheapo knockoff phone without the Amazon logo on the back of the phone.  Definitely you won't impress your colleagues if you are going for the looks.  However, it does feel very sturdy and I can tell it can take some major drops.  I advise getting a case to stylize your phone<br/>Camera (8/10)<br/>The Camera on the Fire Phone is mediocre at best.  It's not as good as Galaxy S5 16MP ISOCELL camera but it serves it purpose.  There is Optical Image Stabilization on this camera which is done quite well and much less blurry shots that you expect from phones such as the Galaxy S5. Details won't be on par with Galaxy S5 but for those quick snap this is the phone to use.<br/><br/>The best part about the camera is not actually the camera but the free cloud storage on the camera.  You get UNLIMITED photo storage using the Fire Phone.  For the ones that go crazy snapping around all the time, you don't have to worry about storage space anymore.  Remember this is for photos and not for videos.  Videos still have storage limits.<br/><br/>Software & Experience (8/10):<br/>There are two major software that is the biggest feature on this phone<br/>Dynamic Perspective - This tracks your head movement by using the 5 cameras in the four corners of the Fire Phone's front face to track your head constantly. If you try to move your head or tilt your phone, your perspective will be align with the phone.  Special viewpoints are like the edge of icons, image focus that you don't see at other angles.  It's fun to play with but frankly a bit of a gimmick.<br/>Firefly - Click the firefly button on the phone and point it towards the item you want to purchase, and it will appear on your phone for purchase if available or recognized.  It's great idea but really only works around 50% of the time.  For example, it's definitely not useful if the item is not on Amazon's selection (which is possible surprisingly) or that it recognize it as something else.  Purchasing can't be more easier with this and it's a very good direction Amazon is taking for improve customer experience.  But until this can work more than 50% of the time, I will stick with the Amazon mobile store for purchases.<br/>The other apps are very similar to the Kindle Fire apps.  If you are using a Kindle Fire, this should be easy for you to use and navigate.  Things like Mayday is still available on the phone which is definitely useful for people who are less tech savvy.  I will find this very useful for my mom so that she can ask Mayday rep the tech questions instead of me!<br/><br/>This phone is definitely not as open as actual Android phones such as Galaxy S5.  Although Fire OS is based on Android, it is still a very closed system and it's Amazon every intention to keep you in their ecosystem.  If you are like me who have Amazon Prime, this device is a godsend.  All your instant video/musics/purchase is tightly intergrated to this smartphone.  If you live by Amazon, this is the phone to get.  However, if you like to play around with things such as custom ROMs then it's best to stay off this phone.  You won't be getting the type of freedom on customization that you get on Android.<br/><br/>Battery (6.5/10):<br/>Battery life is quite good given the phone is not top specification.  However, the Dynamic Perspective and Firefly can drain your battery quite fast if you use it constantly.  Unfortunately, you cannot remove the battery of the phone and replace it with another (which Galaxy S5 has and it is very handy feature to have) so you better be careful how you use your phone.<br/><br/>Complimentary Accessories (6/10):<br/>There are quite a number of cases out for the Fire Phone at launch which is great.  Additionally the accessories that come with the phone such as the earphone are very good.<br/><br/>Value (6/10):<br/>This is a very hard one to write about.<br/>On one hand, you get one full year of Prime membership for free which is 99 dollars in value + unlimited photo storage (which can be quite expensive if you are using other cloud service to storage over 1000 GB of photos)<br/><br/>On the other hand, you are lock down to all Amazon services + AT&T; exclusivity + mediocre specification (though enough for this phone as I mentioned) + $200 on contract for 32gb which is as expensive as some high end phones available today<br/><br/>For value, it really comes down to how often you use Amazon.  If you are an Amazonholic, then this phone will not disappoint you. However, if you don't even have Amazon Prime to begin with or that you are not locked down currently to any Amazon service, this device can be quite expensive for getting into Amazon services.<br/><br/>Conclusion in one sentence: Great for CURRENT Amazon service users & not so great for anyone not locked into their system yet.<br/><br/>Perhaps Amazon needs to rethink its pricing strategy for this device.  For current Amazon customers such as myself who know Amazon good service that we are currently locked into, this is a great upgrade to enhance the shopping experience of Amazon and to enjoy all the Amazon Prime services on my most frequently used device.  However, it can be quite expensive sacrifice for newcomers to Amazon ecosystem especially this phone is not cheap (unlike the Kindle Fire) and that the mediocre specs are not selling itself.  Especially with AT&T; exclusivity, I don't see how this device will be flying off the shelf (think Facebook phone).  What Amazon should do is to reprice this to cheaper bracket (Free on 2 year contract at least) or let people try using this phone for free for a limited amount of time.  Dynamic Perspective and Firefly are just not enough to sell the phone to newcomers.<br/><br/>As mentioned, I will update this review periodically. Next time I will focus on physical wear and tear of the machine after couple more months and again on battery life (as all electronics have a diminishing battery duration throughout its course of use). [...] Thanks for reading!
I had good service in my area with my iphone 4. I got the fire phone as a gift and used it with my current carrier and could no longer get a signal anywhere. Other than that I loved it. Up until it stopped working a few months later. It is now completely dead and I'm back to my old iphone 4.
Phone gets very hot,and screen spontaneously cracked.Freezes up when using apps. Can not get google applications. Has some very nice features,love the large screen. Map application works really well. Very nice camera and video.
I heard a lot of criticism of the Fire Phone before it was released.comments suggested that the 3D effects were gimmicky and that the phones specs were average and that the entire phone was aimed at selling more Amazon products. So maybe this phone isn't for everyone but for people like me, who are frequent Amazon users, it is the perfect phone. I am not spending all my time on the internet shopping on Amazon.in fact I have not used the firefly button except to figure out how it works. But I do own a kindle and I do have an Amazon Prime membership. The phone helps me stay connected with my content. I prefer to read on my Kindle but if I'm out and about, I can read on my phone. I can add to my music queue or my television watch list from either device.I love it.<br/><br/>And I am also very pleased with the camera. I was recently blessed with a new granddaughter, which means lots of pictures and sharing.I believe my phone took the clearest, brightest pictures. Better than the Kodak camera and my daughter's htc one.<br/><br/>About the price: $200 is a premium price for a phone. But at the time I purchased the phone, I got an extra year of Amazon Prime and an upgrade from the 16 GB model to the 32GB model. I'm not sure I'd have paid the$200 otherwise, but I'm glad I didn't have to make that decision. I'm VERY happy with this phone.
Great phone.  Best one I've owned yet.
STILL GETTING USE TO IT BUT VERY HAPPY
Wish I could get spinrilla mixtape app
a  little more harder then you exspect
I like it a lot, just needs more apps.
Fire phone is amazing good quality build and pretty fast, I know is only on AT&T; but is better than any phone a previously owned. My only critic the price tag of this phone would have been at $450 everybody would be loving it.
I had higher hopes for this phone when I got it. I have had it now for 5 months and my time of owning it has not been a pleasant one. I had to get my original replaced because the gyroscopes not being able to sense when I removed the phone from my face. I was unable to end calls so I had to go into setting and make my lock button my end call button. After that I started having another issue to where if I wanted to press on something I would have to do it indirectly in order to get the thing I wanted to press. Example, if want to click on a Facebook message or comment I will have to press above the comments or message that I want to read just to be able to select the one that I want(I have 2 of these phones the both do the same thing). I also expected more from the dynamic display other then lock screens and kid games. The limited app store is also a MAJOR issue. I got my phone when it was strictly for AT&T; so now my att app needs to be updated and can't because the app it self isn't in the store.  In my opinion They should open the phone up to be able to access the Google play store till they get there own store up to par. The only thing this phone really offers. For the price you pay it will be a good phone for a child getting there first phone other then that if your an android lover this phone is not for you.
Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase. This phone while not having as any App's as an IPhone is great for me. Prior to this phone I had always used a BlackBerry which had even fewer Apps available. Time will tell only thing I can see that could be improved is battery charge life.
Amazon App Store lacks so many apps that Apple and Google Play have, I can never find one unique app that Amazon App Store has that the other 'biggies' don't have. My professor requires access to an App for CDC (Center for Disease Control), which is not available not even for tablets.
Absolutely in love with this phone...
First smart phone ...loving thus far!
Only down side is the inability to use the Google play store.  Surely it isn't that difficult for a android based phone to use the play store. Other then that the screen is great and the phone has lots of cool features.
Superb design, sturdy and rugged without sacrificing elegance. Would leave my iPhone for this again in an instant. Did Apple give you a free year of music, videos, and books entirely free of charge? Break from the herd.
I love this phone.  I read some of the other reviews and hesitated to purchase it.  It is quite different than my other droid, so it has a bit of a learning curve.  To date I've been able to figure out most everything.
Not sure what all the hate is about its a really nice phone I had a Windows 8 phone for the last two years and the firephone blows that one away really happy with it and I hope Amazon continues to support the phone
It's everything I hoped it would be.
great phone it was an upgrade for me
to hard to use messages or to small.
Excellent purchase. Love this phone.
The best thing since Apple anything.
The fire phone it's actually and amazing phone, I love the fact that it also comes with Amazon prime for a year. I can watch movies and shows from my fire phone and it's easy to shop from the Amazon webpage. A+++
The phone is great, love it. But when I get a call or try to call someone, the screen goes to sleep and I can't end access the screen and do anything, and I'm just wondering if it's a settings thing that I can change, or is it a update thing where the developers can fix it.
I had to purchase a Manuel because I am not that Literate with  new phones.  It was taking awhile  but I was learning the features.  I was quite advaneed for me.  Then the phone was dropped and had to be replaced with a Samsung phone for some reason.  I did like the phone.
It's a really amazing phone. My only problem is that the voice controls don't have enough functionality. Right now it can only make phone calls, voice-to-do text, go to emails, and go to text messages. I would like to see the ability to vice open or control nearly any app.
Hi my name is Sandra I'm very satisfied with my Fire phone I purchased through Amazon.  The fire phone offers many features that I am very very please with and I am still learning different features every day.
This is my second review.  I bought the first one on the day they came out.  A mistake.  I went round and round on whose fault it was that it did not work right.  Finally, after several months, Amazon replaced it.  The second one is not perfect, but it works much better.
I am a first time smart phone buyer so according to other reviewers, this phone was made for me.  My biggest complaint so far is that I could not move my contacts from my old SIM card to this new one.  What a pain.  According to tech support, this phone does not have the ability to copy contacts into the phone using the SIM.  I tried both AT&T; and Mayday support with no luck.  First AT&T; told me to go elsewhere and have my contacts ripped from one card to the new one.  I did.  It cost me $25 bucks.  New SIM back in phone and nada.  Now even though the contacts are on the card, the phone doesn't recognize they are there so I still have no contacts.  Hopefully an update will help me get my contacts some day.  *In case you were wondering, there is an app to transfer contacts through wifi but since my previous phone was not a smart phone, this won't work for me.  And I don't think I should have to do all these workarounds to fix the problem.
1st simm card failed after 5 days. Great display. Battery life may be a question, charge drops fast after 12 hrs. Huge storage. Not crazy about the firefly button, gets tripped easily. Did I say great display and photo quality.  Check back in a year for the real results
Excellent cell phone, user friendly
Love it. Of course, it is a Kindle.
I went to AT&T; to look at the Amazon Fire Phone and see if I wanted to get it.  It looks and feels great in the hand.  Not as big as the windows phones that I could not hold comfortably.  The display is beautiful!  The dynamic perspective is great.  After I got it, I was able to connect it via Bluetooth to my car - which was a plus.  Connecting to Facebook, LinkedIn, etc was flawless.  Connected to my Amazon account and it pulled in all my books I am reading and where I left off.  Loaded my apps without any issues.<br/><br/>The only disappointment I have had is that Microsoft ActiveSync is not able to be used to sync with my Outlook - why?  Because Microsoft did not update the software to work on Windows 7 or 8 PC's.  However, I came across gSyncit - which is an add-in you can purchase with the license to sync your outlook and Gmail.  It cost $19.99!  Well worth the price and works great!  I have contacted Amazon about this issue.
Easiest smartphone to navigate great phone quality, I have had a kindle tablet for a few years and the phone is very similar. I felt right at home , not intimidated at all.Limited Apps ,and ringtones though
Updated 08/18:<br/><br/>At my AT&T; store this weekend with my son & him buying a Samsung phone. I learned that I could nave returned the Fire Phone within two weeks of it's purchase. Wish I would have known that before (my fault). I certainly would have done so. The inability to use Android Apps is really irritating!!!!!<br/><br/>Original:<br/><br/>I knew that some Android apps would not be compatible with the Fire Phone, but this is ridiculous! Very popular items using GPS such as the INGRESS game and Geocaching.com's apps will not recognize the phone because of the extensive messing around with the operating system that Amazon has done.<br/>I have to live with it for 18 months, then I'm going back to a real Android phone!
Where there's smoke, there's fire. I am upset that one of the Fire's key features, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, comes with a hidden and harmful cost. Unlike Apple and Google who have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, Amazon's data centers are powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. The Fire's reliance on dirty energy isn't cutting edge, and it's completely unnecessary.
Best phone I had for the price. Too bad the whiners couldn't adjust to a great phone. This phone wasn't a clone of anything but its own rather unique rendition of Android. It still is running strong a year later. I wish to buy another for my sons this Christmas.
This phone is freaking awesome!!!!
Love love love love this phone and operating system. Just as simple as my kindle fire. It's the only reason I got a smartphone. Amazon has created an awesome device. Will never use a different phone.
I think this phone is amazing! The only thing that may need some tweeting, in my opinion, is the speaker phone. It goes in and out of sounding like it is in a box. Also, I use the phone for basic functions. Facebook, Twitter, camera, histogram, email, etc.
While initially impressed by the slick marketing, which IMPLIES support for Android apps, upon receiving, and activating, I immediately tried to install all my standard apps that I use.  The first three I tried are productivity apps, which I use for work or managing money - ZERO of them are available for FirePhone.  All the game apps I have on my old phone are supported, but I use them once a month, versus once a day or more for the productivity apps.<br/><br/>The slick features are indeed impressive, and as long as you're OK with the fact that they are primarily designed to drive commerce to Amazon, not enhance your productivity, they seem quite useful.  But the lack of support for apps that are critical to my use of a smartphone mean I will be returning this product, and returning back to a Samsung Android phone, that I know will actually support what I use.
does so many things and awesomely
Just as easy to use as my Kindle.
I love my new Fire Phone.  I have 2 Kindle Fire and 1 Kindle so I guess you can call us a Kindle family.  Everything ties into my phones.  We have two Fire Phones 1 for me and 1 for my grandson.  He also loves the phone.  Great phone I would recommend.
Not all it's cracked up to be...
Just need to learn more about it
i have used it and its wonderful
Wonderful phone and easy to use!
I like the Fire which is similar to my Kindle.  I like the May Day features alot.  I do not care for the Prime Movie selections.  It seems to be geared for a younger audience and we do not have a strong enough internet connection to stream movies.
Love this phone, been using for about 1 month and no complaints on quality or performance, camera, speakers Bluetooth, Wi-Fi hotspot all work great... Kindle's app store is a little sparse compared to Google's app store but it will come with time.
I have to be truthful and say that I am highly disappointed. The gentleman who sold me this phone talked it up and of course I fell into it. I thought maybe it was because I was so used to the iPhone but after some time I see that I am just plain disappointed with this phone. While I appreciate certain qualities, like the quality of its camera, I almost feel like that's the only good thing about this phone. The app store has very few apps that I can actually use (cartwheel, some games that are accessible to androids as well as iPhones, etc), the browser is EXTREMELY sensitive and sometimes I find it clicking something below what I selected (example: when I'm on Facebook {because even the Facebook app messes up} if I click profile pictures, it will select whatever album is underneath, such as mobile uploads), my phone reads texts I sent as new messages so I always have things popping up, and among other things it just runs rather slow. It has potential to be a wonderful phone, but for now I would stay away. When I'm able to purchase a new phone I will certainly be giving this one up.
Why the Fire is really a misfire. I am very disappointed that as Amazon's first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn't that "smart." Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. "One Star" from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.
Edited: called mayday. Turns out screen protector is interfering with sensors. Problem fixed and screen protector refunded :).  Previous post ---Had phone two weeks.  Already having problems with the screen.  It goes totally blank while on a phone call, so you can't access the keypad.  Which makes 90% of calls useless, since they want you to type in something...  Anyone know how to fix?
I purchased this phone when it first hit the market. I've always been a Samsung's girl but allowed myself to be sold. Change is good right? Wrong! I loved being able to shop on Amazon with a touch of my finger but that's not enough to keep me.
love the phone, cannot complain
Great phone very user friendly.
Great functions and reliability
I don't know why everyone hates it so much. It has a sleek nice design and functions well. Love all the features and really love how all of my Amazon devices sync. P.s Apple sucks!
We have only had our phones for a few weeks. We love them and to be honest we almost did not get them because of reviews. The only suggestion that I would recommend is MORE APPS.
The fire phone is a great start it has a good base and a solid start fire Amazon's first phone give it a free months and work on the media player and this phone would be awesome!
difficult to hold the camera button is in the wrong place, too easy to turn on when using phone. Also since my purchase I am receiving ads from other companies I have no interest in...feel like AT&T; has passed me around to the world :(
Absolutely worst Decision of my life. I had my iPhone 4s for 3 years only replace it once. I've had the fire phone for 6 months and replaced it 5 times. I work for AT&T; so when we watched the slide show it looked amazing but once you have it it is awful. Their no apps, the stupid music store pops up all the time the camera button is the same as firefly so if you hold it down a second to long trying to get the camera firefly will pop up. The phone freezes all the time. The only thing that's good is it's bigger than the 4s, bigger memory, and the batter last longer that's it. I can't use my fit bit app to sync because it's not compatible, you can't use the myat&t; app because it tells you it needs an update by Amazon deleted off the market place so now you have an app that doesn't work that your stuck with. It's just a disaster of a phone. And all customer care will do is replace it with a certified refurbished fire phone. I don't want a new piece of crap I want a different phone.  You definitely get what you pay for!!!!
I purchased this last November when they had it on sale for just 200 with a year of prime included.  Phone was more than I expected for the low reviews.  The only downside is the exclusion of Google services but I managed without it.
Great phone horrible app store
Cons:<br/>Does not have speed dial with the number pad<br/>The voice speed dial option is only available when connected to the internet<br/>Voice mail is only available when connected to the internet<br/>Limited apps  (really, no Where's My Droid?)<br/><br/>Edit:<br/>The phone when not on speaker has to be directly in front of the mouth.  In past phones, the phone could hang by my chin, and sound would still be fine.  I am told I can't be heard at all when the speaker isn't directly in front of my lips.  Since the phone is heavy, it is inconvenient to hold it at an angle, rather than straight up and down. This is a pretty big deal, so I changed from 4 stars to 3.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>It synced everything with my Amazon account seamlessly<br/>Easy to use and understand<br/>Fun phone to play with<br/>I can download movies and audible books from my Amazon account<br/>Speaker phone works well<br/>Pictures automatically upload to my Amazon cloud<br/>The Find function on Amazon
I simply love this phone but it does not have snapchat.I would recomend this to anyone.😃
fast shipping. great product.
I love my fire phone really pleased with it. Please don't give up Amazon it does have some bugs and maybe needs upgrades. I hope I can look forward to the next version.
Really like this phone, I purchased the phone for my husband. It is smaller than my Samsung and easier for him to carry.  He did have a flip phone,  so we are having lessons.  I think he will like this phone with every use.
Enjoying my 1st smart phone. I love its photographic capabilities and many other features especially reading books. Just figured out with Mayday help how to use voice recognition to make calls. the mayday feature is awesome
Pros: Instant help (talking to actual person via phone); Tilt phone to access apps<br/><br/>Cons:  All apps needed may not be available.  Locked into Amazon apps - can't access Google play which has the apps I needed.
Amazing. Is all I am saying.
still learning amicable apps
Wonderful phone. Way to fun.
We bought three phones when we upgraded our phones. We have totally enjoyed them. Easy to use and understand. Lots of great tech and we can download apps easily.
gets hot and has short battery life have to keep charging it during the day not good cell service like my other phones
Let me start off by saying I adore this phone. I haven't been this happy with a phone for a long time. I love having the 24/7 customer support and about 99% of the time the representative is easy to talk to and makes contacting them fun. However, the issues that I do have with the phone are mainly cosmetic issues. I can't download ANY notification sounds, so i'm stuck with the ones the phone was given. Any time I try to download a notification sound app and apply the ringtone it says 'No sound will play when you receive texts'. I have contacted them about 4 times about this issue and all I can be told is 'we'll submit it feedback'. I understand that it's a new phone and a first journey for Amazon but it's still irritating. I like the ability to customize my phone with tones and clock colors to set ANY wallpaper I wish, but these are not a possibility with this phone. Another issue I have some of the apps that come with the phone cannot be removed. I will never use them, and they are constantly turning themselves on and draining my battery. I can force quite several programs but they still turn themselves on so that my battery is about 65% from unplug at 7 in the morning to about 3:30pm. It's a pain but manageable.
I could not have been more surprised and pleased when I received this phone. It really does compare to any other phone out there insofar as speed and options.
I really like my fire phone. It does everything I need it to do with a lot of bonuses. I love to be able to watch my movies on the go the picture is nice and it does not get that hot. All in all its a nice phone.
I have it now and I love it
My daughter love her phone.
It is a great phone love it
Love the Amazon fire phone.
Sound quality is good. Functionality is good, not great. UI leaves a lot to be desired, unless your a gadget freak like me. My wife however is not pleased.
I Love It! Great features and amazing clarity of pictures....Had a few problems with the messaging but after contacting tech support everything is great. I can't put my phone down I have so much fun with it :D
My Amazon Fire Phone was a Christmas gift from my son, Jay, and the features continue to amaze me. Just keeps opening up more and more exciting features and I look forward to discovering it in its entirety.
I would have given this phone a higher rating, if there would be some way to make the font larger in text messages. Other than that, a very nice phone.
It's fast, sleek and smooth. It easy to get to what you want. I love the daily changing screens. I would recommend this to anyone that wanted a phone.
Dont't care fot this phone
My voice input doesnt work
The fire phone is bad-ass!
It is a great phone so far
Great phone<br/>Few problems, like my music store never fully closes and the speakers are not great quality on it but otherwise easy to use and fast
Love my fire phone...wish there was a back button the only complaint I have...except disappointing that there is not an updated new version coming..
This is one awesome phone. I like it better than Samsung's Galaxy S III. A very durable phone and not that complicated to use once you get rolling with it. I would recommend it to anyone of my friends
Bought this with the aim of taking advantage of the free prime , only to find out, the free prime promotion was quietly ended a few days before it arrived. Phone feels solid, but extremely limited.
My twins love them thanks
it is a really good phone
Very easy to set up and use right out of the box.  Love the mayday feature for getting answers very quickly by a live person.  Big screen and has tons of free apps, amazon prime also a big plus.
Really enjoying this phone!!! Only thing it needs is a built in App that will close other apps previously opened. Tends to freeze from time to time due to inability to track RAM being used up.
It does everything I want. My first smartphone so I don't Google apps. Love how everything on my phone and on my kindle link. Plus I like to be different than everyone else. Sorry I phone.....
Don't buy this phone, it's cheap. I love Amazon but this phone, huge disappointment. No Google play store, Amazon store is bad. Overall vad
I love this phone the amazon prime is awesome and has a lot of different features that I phone didn't have but I can do almost every thing my iPhone did I definitely recommend the fire phone
Let me first say I am a big fan of Amazon, been a customer since day 1.  I think they are innovative and very customer oriented,  I have never had a problem with anyting Amazon,  I took a chance and preordered this phone becuase I was due for an upgrade, I had confidence in Amazon and the free yr of Prime which I use constantly, I have to say, I'm more than a little disappointed.  I am by no means an expert.  I use my phone for calls, texts, some email and an ocassional game,<br/>Maybe the high tech stuff is great, I really wouldn't know, but the basics are not good.  Simple stuff, like being able to change the ring tone for texts.  You can assign a specific ringtone to a specific contact, but you can't change all of them at once. I'm not going to sit here and go through 100 contacts to change the tones. The only display option you can change is the brightness.  Texts display in a gray color on a white background making it difficult for me to see.  Would really like to be able to change contrast or font color and background screen for easier viewing.<br/> Apps are another problem,  I had apps for my local news and weather on my old phone which are not available on the Amazon app.  Of course they are in Google Play, but you can't get there from here.  I had to buy an app to transfer my music from itunes to the phone and i didn't work very well.  I got some songs, but not all and I don't think the sound is anything special. No decent emoticons that can be added in text through the keyboard. Also, I can't figure out ow to delete songs I don't want and change the view.  I want to see a list, not all the album art, etc.  Can't figure out how do delete texts either.<br/>I'm not crazy about the lock screen images either.  Maybe this shows how tech clueless I am, but I don't get the dynamic persepctive thing.  I've only seen it on the lock screen, but I dont see what the big deal is.<br/>The things I think are good are the Mayday service (tech was very helpful and it was great not having to scroll through a bunch of info to get my question answered). All data, photos and contacts transferred simply and quickly through the ATT mobile transfer app. Navigation is easy and screen size is awesome.<br/>I am not receiving some texts, but not sure if this is a phone issue or ATT issue.<br/>My old phone is an iphone 4s.  Seriously considering swtiching back.
I got my Fire phone and so far I'm pleased with it's performance.  I switched from a Samsung Galaxy S3 and there was a bit of a learning curve.  Readers of this review should know I use my phone for mostly a phone (imagine!), though I do check my email, Facebook, and Pinterest when I'm bored or waiting for something.  I don't play a lot of games on it, nor do I use it to listen to music.  I have yet to try out video streaming, though I plan to when I can scrape up some time.  I'm very pleased with the battery life.  I got it to last two days at the longest without having to charge.<br/><br/>The Maps app sucks!  That's the worst thing I have to say about the phone.  I used Google Maps on my Samsung S3 and loved it because of the turn by turn directions I could get on it.  I drive a lot.  This Maps app needs some serious upgrading.  Can't really use it in the car without being a danger to myself and others.  Please, Amazon, improve the Maps app.<br/><br/>The free year of Prime was a big inducement to get me to try this phone.  Overall, I'm not disappointed.
I bought this phone for a few reasons. One, my iPhone only allowed my mom to restrict apps by age. She had to restrict all because of Google being 4+. So I had no apps. I already had a kindle, and it allowed her to manually confirm or deny an app. So, I thought it would be nice to have apps in my phone, so I got one. Very nicely surprised.<br/><br/>Another reason is that I'm a developer. Haven't been for long, but I decided it'd be best for testing to have multiple testing devices (I have a first gen kindle) and this works well with Unity. One complaint I want to get rid of is everyone saying there is no software back button. Wrong. Swipe up from the bottom. That's all.<br/><br/>Overall, the phone is great, but the limited appstore is its biggest drawback.
I saw a lot of lousy reviews on Amazon's website but they seemed like they had an axe to grind...they are nuts! This phone is AMAZING!!
Good device Terrible IOS it just wouldn't interact with Google without device modification but once they get side loaded they're Amazing XDA anyone side load yet I'm seriously considering it? The Keyboard is the most disappointing part you wouldn't think Amazon would screw that up but they did.Silk Browser is slow and lagging you can speed it up by turning cloud features off. Amazon steals your personal music and sell it to others. They will even sell you a free Mixtape. The components are top notch too good for the programming that's in it. Amazon as A OEM? Well maybe if they could build a app conversion engine into the next update
Too many glitches. It shows a mythical location as my current location that I've never heard of, and the wrong temperature/weather conditions. Facebook features don't work. Messaging didn't work at first (until I spent 3 hours with a technician on Mayday, and then we still couldn't figure out what fixed it). The Mayday app is good, but the mute button doesn't work, so you hear elevator music the whole time you're on hold. Firefly works only on things you can buy from Amazon, and wouldn't even recognize a Budweiser. Wallet only takes gift cards. It's definitely not the mobile payment device I was hoping for. Also they call everything on the back end Kindle. If I had wanted a Kindle, I would have gotten one. Very disappointed.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Went back to the AT&T; store and got my Blackberry Torch 9800 turned back on. Am sending the Fire Phone back to Amazon tomorrow. Struck by how many low reviews of this phone say, "really wanted to like this phone." That's exactly how I felt. Was ready to make the commitment, just not ready for so many things not to work. Some things others have noted that were also true for me: No way to back out of apps, and in many cases you have to force quit apps. That's really a deal breaker. There is no navigation like there is on my Blackberry, allowing you to use the BBerry button to open up a pull-down list of options for each application you're in. Also someone else noted that the home screen (where you put your favorite pic) isn't where your apps live, so you only see that screen when you first turn on the phone. There's no way to delete app content that no longer applies, like a photo I took and deleted still showed up in the carousel. There's no light indicator that will tell you when you have new messages. The FB and Twitter apps don't get red stars on the icons showing you have updates. The screen protector I bought at the AT&T; store wasn't sensitive enough to enable the touch screen to work well, especially the left pull-in nav. Inexcusably glitchy. We are the guinea pigs for this phone.
This phone is great in many ways.  The pictures, including even the ones I take, are fantastic.  But, the "dynamic perspective" is, as they say, a legend only in Amazon's mind.  I found it difficult to work & found out only after 15 minutes with a help rep, that it certainly doesn't work as advertised--i.e., there's hardly any 3d & you have to work really hard to find & set it up.  Actually, I still haven't gotten it to work properly, I'm just tired of talking to their help folks, although they are very nice and as helpful as they can be. I guess I'll call again tomorrow & try yet again to figure how--or if--this works. This is a major disappointment, as the 3d feature, as advertised, was one of the main reasons I bought the phone.
Just love my new phone.
Very good, enjoying it.
I enjoy my Amazon phone
Amazing phone I love it
I love my Fire!  This is the best phone I have had in a long time.  The Fire is easy to learn and use.  My advice is to get you one immediately.  You will not regret your purchase!
It is everything as described....the dynamic perspective is absolutely amazing!  I actually have an iPhone 5 and a Note 3 and just as each of them have their great features, so does the Fire.  Its light, thin, smooth setup and operation.  Most of the reviews compare the Fire to a Samsung or iPhone, for me it isn't either one.  Why would I buy a Fire phone hoping it is like an iP5 or N3?  I do not have a Kindle reader (have iPad & Samsung tablet), but for those that do, you would probably love the Fire.  Its fast, smooth to operate and very responsive to the touch.  Not sure if its overpriced as some reviews have said......seems to have some features that the iPhone or Samsung have yet to accomplish.  I love my N3 screen size, but the Fire screen size is bigger than the current iP5......maybe the iP6 will increase.  I do love the free year of Prime since I wasn't a customer prior; Amazon definitely has me hooked on Prime.  Either way, its an individual preference but I think its a great first step for Amazon.
You can definitely tell there are so glitches they need to work out. It's nothing over the top fancy, just your basic smart phone. But it's practical and simple for the most part.
I love my Fire phone. I'd give it 5 stars except I'm still mad that I paid $99 for mine and now they're being given away for.99¢!
Enjoying all the bells and whistles that came  in apps for phone productivity.  Love ease of Amazon everything and just like always.  Prime worth every penny  and aims to please.
So awful. Unless you're buying at less than $50 after Prime, it is not worth it. Software is awful and gimicky and very 2010ish.
I wanted to love it and I did, it has all the features I like and want. I love the size the weight of it and the way the screen is.  The firefly is amazing feature that is the gravy.  The amazon prime is another bonus.  All and all love this phone I'm hooked.  One note I bought a screen protector and luckily I found out the screen protector was causing the phone not to work properly be careful when you make a purchase on the screen protector use mayday before you buy a protector.  Great phone ! Very happy customer.
I like the amazon fire a lot, certain things I didn't like I have to delete messages one by one not in a group. But that's it.
Best I ever had.
Please fix this issue.
It meets my expections
I love my kindle phone
It's an awesome phone!
Love it, just love it.
We're very happy with our fire phones. Has a few issues but they are minor and Amazon seems to be listening and fixing them.
Whoever doesn't like this phone... well shame on them. I absolutely love my fire phone. It's so much better than an iPhone.
This phone has no battery life. It takes forever for a text to be sent. The store does not have all the apps that I was told it had, and need! This phone is always searching for a signal when I know I have good service. I hate that the only way to back out of something is swiping up on the screen. The charger has a bad habit of coming loose from the phone even when no one touches it. The only good thing about the Fire is the screen is clear. I would NOT recommend this phone to anyone.
I am very happy with the phone. I had it now for almost 2 years and was looking to get one for my daughter, only to find out they are unavailable and might not be back.
This is my absolute favorite phone! I love its features, it's speed, and it's all around usability! I've always loved the fire os so having it on the phone is amazing!
Pretty awesome phone although it doesn't get some of the apps I use on a daily basis.. like timehop and perfection365 and photofy.. if it did I would give it 5 stars..
Suggestion: Add an option to run a series of movies. This will eliminate the nuisance of having to select another movie when the current movie finishes.  George Ulseth
Crushing on my fire phone, having had it just under 4 hours now. The ability to scroll screens with one hand frees up my other hand for coffee, etc...I gave up my Google Nexus 5, which I loved dearly, but I think I will enjoy this phone for its well thought out screens that require less tapping and the dynamic perspective is sweet... and the screen is beautiful. I own Kindle, Kindle Fire, Fire TV, and now Fire phone. Thanks Amazon...I'm always excited about what you'll do next.
Pretty good phone....
Really enjoy my phone
This phone is great..
Fire phone is very nicely organized and fun to use battery is very efficient in standby and talk time lasting superbly well, am very HAPPY with AMAZON FIRE PHONE!!!
Worked well for my daughter I sent mine back as a professional who constantly uses my phone I'll stick to my Samsung!
Absolutely an amazing phone!!!!! I switched over from from my boost mobile galaxy s3 and I love it. Only downside is the phone does not support hulu or snapchat :/
Love the phone. I don't like not being able to delete the recent call history all at once. The help button is great!
Phone does not fully charge.  Only to 98% at brand new.  Makes me wonder if battery will last long?  Volume for text messages is very low, on the highest setting.
Horrible customer service!  First off let me just say it takes me quite a bit to get to the point where I actually write a negative reviewe. I have read numerous reviews on Amazon over the years as I have loved Amazon and it's products. I laugh at somem people because a lot of the time they are common sense issues. Having said that I find myself writing a negative review that has nothing to do with common sense. The main issue my fiance and I have with her Amazon Fire phone is #1 it's not working properly, but #2 Amazon doesn't seem to have a clue or the concern to properly deal with providing quality customer service. I have never see such a thing. We went through AT&T; to get the phone and within 24 hours had problems with getting bumped off of wi-fi thus chewing up our data allowance,  the phone freezing up and not transitioning to different screens, becoming uncomfortably hot, and overall just being a real pain to use. We go back to the AT&T; store and we talked to a number of reps on Amazon's end having to go through the story each time. AT&T; said we could swap it out...oh but not so according to Amazon. They tried to troubleshoot it on their end and fix the issues with the phone still in our possession. Some things improved but not the main issues we were having. Wouldn't it make more sense to just send the customer another phone and try to fix the original phone at Amazon headquarters or wherever instead of making us wait?? Oh it gets better. We get a call from a regional rep saying he was going to come to our house and personally work this out for us. Wow. Ok, great! Uh not so fast. Now he says he's talking to his superiors and working on this issue. WHAT IS THERE TO WORK ON? Are you welding something? Splitting the atom? Pushing a bill through Congress? What is the deal??!! Amazon acts like we're trying to put one over on them, as if we want a new and better phone or something. WE WANT THE SAME PHONE JUST ONE THAT WORKS! After a few messages to Randy the regional rep I stated that this is ridiculous and getting to the point that we don't even want the phone now and that we may take our business elsewhere. Unfortunate, because I like Amazon. But maybe they should stay out of the phone business! Or take a customer service course or something. My fiance never had a problem with her phone and we did all the suggestions mentioned to us with internet resetting of password, wi-fi etc and the 4 other people in the house have never and do not experience issues with their phones. She never had a problem with her previous I-phone either. But as of now we still are in limbo and think we may just bag the whole thing. Thanks for all the help Amazon. NOT!
I was really looking forward to getting this phone when I first saw this ad online about a month ago.  I even had a Sony Xperia Z1 ordered then canceled it upon seeing the ad for this phone.  So I waited tirelessly and anxiously for this phone to arrive and when I got it I was very excited but unfortunately seeing all the mediocre reviews online and the TV commercials being advertised by two children really turned me off.  I thought at least I would give it a try but what I discovered from the lack thereof was the deal breakers for me.  I will just summarized by the Pros and Cons below.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>1. This Amazon Fire phone doesn't give you the option in importing all your contacts from you old sim card so all the contacts I have on my older phone wasn't able to get transferred to this Amazon phone?!  I have over 200 contacts so I certainly wasn't going to manually input all the names and phone number one by one.  This is after calling Amazon tech support and AT&T; support still no way of transferring even using AT&T; online addressbook.<br/><br/>2. Battery starts to drain when you use the primary most talked about features, 3D resolutions,  I have a petpeev about weak battery life so this was dud to me.  Besides what's the use of the 3D anyway, it's not like the entire phone is made up of 3D it's more for certain games and for using some map features which i careless.<br/><br/>3. I use my phone without internet or wifi most of the times so when I'm driving or just listening to a radio I could use either Soundhound or Shazam to search the name of the music or songs on the radio.  Of course, the Shazam or Soundhound will save the songs and I'm able to access the saved songs once I have wifi.  But with Firefly or downloading the Shazam ti didn't have the capability to save or stored the song and be able to search later with wifi?  That's a big NO NO!  Also, NO SoundHound either from the Amazon app store.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>1. Nice looking phone.<br/><br/>2. Prime membership if you shop with Amazon at least once a month like I do.<br/><br/>3. Amazon 24 hour customer service.<br/><br/>Concusion:<br/><br/>I returned the phone only a one day of usage and went ahead and ordered the Sony Xperia Z1 from Amazon.  So I still gave Amazon the business even though I returned the Fire phone.  Nevertheless, the Fire phone is limited for me, especially that contacts I couldn't import.  Now that I got my Sony Xperia Z1 today, it's working just like I expected, the contacts importing feature is there and I had no trouble importing all 200 plus contacts and I'm also able to shop at Google Play store without worrying about whether they have apps I need or not like I would with Amazon app stores.  I still love Amazon for the shopping convenience and their customer service but their Fire phone is, I guess, what it's advertised to be, more suitable for children.
Buy a Samsung phone for Samsung is way more green and far more user friendly.
Love it! So glad I chose it over another iphone when upgrading became available!<br/>Fun phone. I just wish there were some apps compatible with google
I had to get this on day one. The browser was a bit buggy connecting earlier today, but it is working fine now that I have it connected to my home wifi network. The Firefly feature is fun to play with. The first three items I scanned were all from the Food Network line of merchandise, and all three showed up. Sadly to say, when I checked the Amazon price, it beat my price paid by 50% on one item. I also bought some cleaning cloths at a local grocery chain, and Amazon beat their price by $1.99. Amazon did not win on all the items, but they were competitive in the losses. I am not a professional reviewer, but I will add to this review, and break it out to cover all major features of the Fire as I learn them. In closing, this phone is not an iPhone or a Galaxy. If it was, I would not be writing a review tonight.
It's a great phone!
Easy to use, mayday button for immediate help from Amazon when needed. Syncs to your Amazon account and has cool lock screens and games. Touch screen.
Still learning how to use it. It's pretty easy to use. Way smarter then any other smart phone I have had.
The phone itself looks interesting. But as I have no idea if it's sourced from conflict-free heavy metals, or if the people who make it have decent working conditions and wages, or how the servers that power its unlimited cloud-stored data get their energy, then I'm not willing to be impressed. Cool tech is nice. Responsible, transparent, intelligent, compassionate tech is worthy of my interest. And, yes, I'm on a MacBook right now, using Comcast internet, and yes, I have protested to them about FoxConn and the Time-Warner merger, and any number of other things. I know they're not perfect. I've been an Amazon customer and reseller, too- so I'm not saying Amazon is criminal- just sneaky, and unforthcoming, which in this day and age is unacceptable.
It's a nice phone but you can't get some of the apps that you could with an android phone. But I've only had it for two weeks but I enjoy it so far
I upgraded from s2 galaxy phone. So I'm not a super picky person when it comes to technology. the camera is amazing. It takes great pictures. Sometimes I accidently take pictures when I'm trying increase the volume on the phone. Texting is easy. One of my complaints is when Im on the phone people can't hear me. It's so frustrating. So when I am on the phone I have to be on speaker phone. The battery life is super short. I bought a external battery pack because I intend on keeping the phone because I hope they're able to fix the issues. May Day is great. I used it the first day I received the phone. The dynamic perspective is fun to show people. I really wished the basics like voice calls and battery life were up to par with the other phones on the market or at least better. I'm hopefull it will get better.
This is a great phone I'm so glad I didn't listen to all the bad reviews. Here's the thing if you want an iPhone get an iPhone if you want an android get an android. this phone is neither and if you are expecting it to be just like one of those then you are stuck in a very small box. It does have limited apps so what do you really need all the one you have now probably not. I just came from an iPhone and this phone is so much better. It so easy to use. I really can't think of anything that I would change about this phone at all.  So if you want to try something that everyone isn't going to have the this is the phone for, you if you would like to be just like everyone else then stick with what you have I'm sure you are already there. Oh and you get a yr of prime free so why would you not want this phone.
I am really disappointed with this phone.  I've always had a great experience with Amazon products...until now.  I have honestly never had a phone that glitches and freezes up as much as this one does.  I went out on a limb and chose to go with Amazon over Apple and I am really regretting my decision.  I will be counting down the days until my next upgrade.  This is going to be a very long 2 years.
This is really a great phone!  I haven't gotten through all the features yet, but what I've seen so far, I really like.  I would highly recommend!
My phone shipped with version 3.5 of the fire os.  There are so many missing features.  When I call Mayday, they are using 3.5.1 so they can't help me troubleshoot my phone because it still has 3.5!  I am giving it 3 days then I'll return the phone.  Basic features like folders, screenshots and multitasking are not present in 3.5.<br/>The hardware is great but the os is not ready for primetime!
It's a good phone just some similarities to the i phone otherwise I would of given it a 5 star rating
Do not waste your time or money purchasing this phone.  I was excited when this phone came out and purchased 2, one for myself and one for my fiance.  As a loyal Amazon customer I tried everything I could do to get this phone to work for me with no luck at all.<br/><br/>When I called customer support concerning the phone I spent 45 minutes on the phone most of it on hold as the CSR did not even know what steps to take in order to trouble shoot the issue, long story short I am stuck with $400 piece of junk and will have to just purchase 2 new phones out of pocket.<br/><br/>I miss calls and voice mails only to have them show up 1 to 2 days later.  The screen freezes repeatedly and always at the most inopportune times.  Phone powers down for no reason even when fully charged so do yourself a favor and do not use it as an alarm clock.  The tilt and swivel features do not work consistently and the phone fails to go black when on a call allowing you to accidentally drop calls or press buttons while holding the phone up to your ear.  I was informed by the CSR that those are optional features and therefore not covered under any sort of warranty.<br/><br/>In short I suffered for being loyal to amazon and not returning the phone the day I got it.  I really wanted this phone to work and kept giving it chance after chance only to be let down and punished for my loyalty.  Amazon has successfully lost me as a customer.  I would much rather pay slightly higher prices for good quality and better customer service.
For the price, it is an excellent phone.  The camera and the speakers, however, need improvement.  Then again, for the price it is excellent...
Well rounded phone, good battery, does multitasking easily, can access any part of the phone quickly
I love it so much.
I love this phone.
Amazon could be a major contender in this market if they had a subsidized phone plan....NO AT&T.;  They could compete with Ting, Virgin, and T-Mobil.  That would have been the right play.
I really like this phone except it didn't have the apps always use. Need to work on getting those!
It is very slow, it locks up all the time. not happy with it at all.
I bought the unlocked version about 9 months ago.  I like it.  Phone works fine and texting.  Image on screen is very clear and colors are true.  I wanted a larger screen and more memory and didn't want to pay $600-700.  I got what I wanted for a decent price.  I was hoping as time went on Amazon would have more apps available.  I just (for the umpteenth time) inadvertently deleted the Weather Channel app from my phone, trying to delete it from the Carousel.  When I went to app store, it was no longer available.  Safe to assume Amazon is no longer supporting the Fire Phone? nor developing apps?  I like the device.  I sure miss my i-phone apps big time.  I know there is some way to "sideload" from Google, I am not technically advanced enough for that.
As always Amazon products are amazing. Excellent device. Advance features. Camera is so amazing.
I do like the phone, however sometimes the screen freezes but not for long and I wish it had face time. But all in all it is a gr8 phone.
Like it just fine
It's pretty cool.
Awesome phone..!!
Awesome love it !
This phone is sleek,sheek, and a new twist on your modern day technology. I've never owned an iPhone. I look at them mess with them it's the same thing all the time. If your looking for something basic with different features. Wouldn't  say better bc there's a ton out there. Go for this phone. Regaurdless you can text and call that's a we really need. Pricey yes. Very over priced if you get the right deal though no worries! People need to stop being harsh on the app selection that comes in time. I have a kindle which the fire phone is very similar. Anyways candy crush didn't come for like almost a few months on owning it. Amazon likes to test the waters be for  they dive right in. I respect this company so much it's a bold move. It's out there and when people become more aware it will over take "popularity" iPhones are cool but there not unique. Thanks again amazon for another awesome tool just add apps eventually like I know you will!
Fire phone blasting ....it's amazing network connection...is very fast, while comparing to other phone's in India of the same range....
It's a very nice phone makes Amazon Easter to shop on but that's all it is great with the dynamic vision is cool but sometimes annoying
I love my phone they did a pretty good job on it on one thing I wish it could have is wallpaper but all and all I like the phone a lot!
I love the relative ease of use and not too terribly complex for an older person.  (Late 50s)
Love this phone but I wish they had more apps available like Snapchat. The camera is amazing.
I thought this would be a great item cause I shop amazon a lot, but just because I shop amazon doesn't mean I wanna by everything from them. This phone is worse then the stupid iPhone. So concerned on making money they forgot to keep it simple.<br/>The phone is simple on basics, want to start using your apps get out the computer cause youtube is the best way to learn.<br/>Its slow even on WiFi, you can't personalize it at all, the only thing this thing is good for us a paper weight, or an alarm clock.
I love the phone. Easy to use, fast, color is good. When taking photos the picture isn't as clear and sharp as I thought it would be.
I pre-ordered this phone.  I am such a huge Amazon fan that I didn't think twice about which new phone I was getting when I saw these coming out.  Now I've had it for about 8 months and I am already considering another phone.  The features this phone has are great.  I love FireFly, the pictures and storage are wonderful, but there are too many apps I cannot load.  I moved from an iPhone so I knew that I wasn't going to have as many options but it is getting to a point where there are more things I can't load than can.  My bank apps, my Square app for my business, even the blue tooth isn't as good as my iPhone.  I will probably pass the phone on to my young daughter who will love it, but it just isn't working well for me.
I love my fire phone , but the OS definitely needs to be improved, When can we expect the new OS to be released for the fire phone ?
Love this phone. I don't understand the negative reviews. I've had it for several months now and it functions better than an iPhone.
Have had an IPhone for the past 4 years and switched the Amazon fire phone. Cool to have something different defiantly user friendly
This phone is very fast and just the right size, best phone I've ever owned, Thanks Amazon!
The phone itself is very good  but too much amazon advertising and would like more free games that do not require online purchasing
So, I'm in love with this phone for such a simple girl like me. And I just found a feature I hadn't read about anywhere yet (don't know if anyone else has mentioned it ) that when you are in your web browser or in a few basic functions of your phone and the phone is turned either way you can Swype from the bottom of the side you are holding and it goes back....so not just from the very bottom of the phone kinda surprised me and impressed at the same time. Also. I love the planet puzzles game. It has an amazing strategy to the game and impressive layout with very exciting colors that keeps my son wanting to learn more at the next level. :) so the 7 year old approves and so do I! More review to come soon!
I have 2, I bought 1 lost it, Purchased another 4 my business and WoWzers! Works Wonders!
Love this phone.
Love this phone!
Love this phone.
BEST PHONE EVER!
I absolutely love my Fire Phone!! The display is amazing!! I'm tech illiterate so the Fire Phone is easy to use and understand.
Do not understand bad reviews for this phone.  It is a great value!!!!  I could not be happier with the features on this phone.
I am having trouble for my phone to charge I barely have 5 months and already problems.
Real nice phone, can't use all of my favorite apps that I did on my last Android phone.
There are many apps that are not available in the app store that I would like to have.  Also, apps that I do have from the Amazon App store crash.  Then I have to go thru removing the app from my phone.  Restarting my phone and then adding the app again.  I wish I had waited for the fire to be on the market for a longer time.
So far so good! I've read all the complaints about it, but for my purposes it works just fine! I'm very happy with this phone.
We kept the Fire phone for about 7 days before returning it. It's okay. I did not like the wallpaper of the home screen - or lack of. It's just black with no options to change it and add color to the background. The 3D lock screen was super cool, however. The camera was just okay (I went with a Samsung S4 Zoom and the cameras aren't even comparable; Zoom is much better if you want a nice camera). Husband returned his Fire phone and went with the LG Flex phone instead.
I am very difficult to please as a consumer. The firephone is a great device that compares favorably with any other platform/device combination. Every device on the market has a couple of downsides, this one is not an exception. Many of the reviews on this device are from users who are displeased with "dirty energy". I am also displeased with this, but it does not affect my score.
As a big fan of Amazon and a Prime member, I really wanted to love this phone.<br/>I placed an order on June 19 and waited for this phone to arrive but I decided to return this device - I rarely return products.<br/><br/>Bad things about the phone.<br/><br/>- Battery.<br/>Only a couple of hours of usage brings the battery down to ~50% and charging seems to take too long. I read that Firefly and dynamic perspective are the culprit, but.. aren't they what this phone is about? I spend so much time on mobile devices.This was a big deal-breaker for me. Also the phone gets pretty warm with little use.<br/><br/>- Firefly.<br/>I love shopping. I've read negative reviews about this feature but I was so excited that I'd be able to easily look up the price of the items that I like on the street and order them from Amazon. As soon as the phone arrived, I tried with different products at home. It could only find books. It couldn't even identify the sunscreen (with clear labels) or other products that I purchased on Amazon. The text scanning is not bad though. It can read email address and phone number quite well - but you can also easily type them.<br/><br/>- Carousel + Recommendations.<br/>Recently used apps and consumed contents are displayed in the 'carousel.' And you see product recommendations below them. As much as I appreciate Amazon's well-tuned recommendations, I have to say that this is overwhelming. I'd understand if I didn't pay for the phone. I paid the full price without the contract and this seems like an intrusion of my personal space. Or is there a setting to turn this off that I couldn't find?<br/><br/>Good things about the phone.<br/><br/>- Dynamic Perspective.<br/>Better than I expected. You get used to it pretty quickly and is actually quite useful. I loved how I could read long pages with just one hand. Also love how simple motion displays information that you may find useful such as casts for movies, lyrics for music, etc. while watching Amazon contents. Hope Amazon expands partnerships with non-Amazon entities to enable this for contents from other sources. Also love the preloaded games. I will miss these games once I return the phone.<br/><br/>- Good, crisp display. Personally prefer this to Galaxy or iPhone.<br/><br/>- Smart bundled earphone.<br/><br/>- I only use a handful of apps anyways and I see there's an option to use apps from Google Play. However, I haven't found an option to allow to install apps downloaded from unidentified source.<br/><br/>I really wanted to keep this phone but I thought it over and came to the conclusion that the goods just can't justify $700+.
Had a problem with original phone. Because of warranty, the phone was replaced. I was very satisfied with customer service.
love it still using it but on h20 wireless now only 54 dollars a month unlimited data and text n talk using same att bands!
Am enjoying my new phone, however I am having a hard time finding the delete button.
I really wanted to like this phone, but it is really gimicky at best as another viewer posted.  I too thought it would be similar to the kindle technology with great visuals and easy use.  But I find this phone to be quite the opposite.  It is difficult to use, you have to connect the phone to the computer to download files, photos and music.  And the camera is awful. The apps are limited and I can go on.  The only things that work decent are the amazon related products.  It isn't a bad phone but it doesn't work for me.  I purchased this at the discounted rate on amazon with no contract and will be going back to a galaxy 5 or 6 as soon as the prices drop a bit.
As a cell phone it simply isn't up to snuff. My biggest gripe is that I need to be able to use this phone hands free in my car and truck but the bluetooth looses its connection every time I take my phone with me into a store or where ever I've stopped and will not reconnect on its own when I enter the vehicle again the way that other phones do. I've tried to use this phone with 4 different hands free units including two that are built into my car and truck and I get the same result. It's unbelievable to me that this particular feature wasn't tested prior to being introduced to the consumer market. I am happy with the camera so I guess it's not a total loss.
Love it love it love it! Its like having my kindle fire that I can text and make phone calls with. With way more storage!
Very good phone
Perfect for me.
I love my phone
Love this phonr
Like the phone.
So far so good!
Best phone ever
Love this phone
I like everything about the phone with one exception. Would like it to hAve a favorite list for the most called numbers.
The phone is great.  The only issue I have with it is that the keyboard will periodically freeze up and I must restart.
This an awesome piece of technology, I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I knew it better.
My Amazon Fire phone was delivered when it was expected. It is a beautiful easy to use phone. I is larger than an iphone but not too much. It has access to loads of apps; in which many are free. It has a feature that I really love and that featue is called Mayday.  Whenever I have a problem all I have to do it to go to that setting and it walks me thru whatever I am trying to do. It;s awesome and I really love it. I got it thru an upgrade so it did not cost anything  and I up graded at a time when it had a year of free Prime added to it.  So far I havethe Kindle fire and now the Fire phone..  One can not go wrong when dealing with Amazon
Runs great. Some apps are still unavailable for the phone and Angry birds stalls on me but other than that it's great.
there is a few things that still need to be fixed and a few apps need to be added for this phone but overall I like it
It had great effects... clarity and entertainment is great...got the phone for my son and he can't put it down. .
...and hit a home run for green energy! The major players are already running their cloud services on 100% renewable energy, and Amazon can too. Amazon, you'll have one star and no business from me until you make the pledge. Thank you for listening, and I"m sure you'll make the right choice.
Overall I like it, only real complaint is there isn't the Google play store.
Heats up a lot
It's very good
Excellent case
Turkey amazing
Amazing phone!
I talked with the best representative in the world....she was a great help to me....I love my new phone...thanks
This is not a perfect phone. Yet, I can see that the team at Amazon did make an effort to be unique and innovative. I have come to love this phone and I'm happy I purchased it. It runs smoothly, it has everything I need on a phone, it looks sharp, music sounds great and the battery life is pretty amazing.<br/><br/>Listen up, Amazon- your first phone wasn't the best, but it's a damn fine phone. Please don't stop making them because it wasn't perfect. I enjoy being in the Amazon ecosystem, it is so convenient and a breath of fresh air from Android and Apple. Give us a Fire Phone 2, please.
Its a great phone, has lots of of features and such but it's a little bit glitchy. For example, sometimes very once in a while the screen won't come on unless I hold the power button (no, it's not turned off. When the screen comes back on it asks if I want to turn off or restart the phone.) another thing is that sometimes the screen comes on and then locks itself right back befor the scene can even display. There's a need for dynamic perspective to be slightly tuned so my screen doesn't wig out when someone leans over my shoulder, etc. etc.<br/><br/>Either way still better than my iPhone
I used it  for some time already, feel this it is pretty good rather than other,my some friends all like it ！
Great device. I love how I have literally have Amazon at my finger tips and my free Amazon Prime for a year.
I love it
I haven't bought one yet but I did fall in love with it at the AT&T; store this morning.  It appears the worst reviews were in August with huge improvements in September and October. I'm probably going to get one next week. Your reviews have been great!!!  Thanks
The phone is not for me but for my grand-daughter.  She is loving it!!!
I know this might sound crazy to some of you. But when I buy a phone I gotta be able have ringtone and ringback. I would have like to have more lock screen option or maybe even an lock screen app. (No Google play)some apps that I use everyday like for instance my bank app. Every phone I have had had a section or app where you can download ringtones and ringbacks from music artist I mean what  phone doesn't have ringbacks ugh! Other than that I do love the phone. Unless I'm missing something(let me know) I would just say make sure this is the right phone for you.
Love it!!!!!!
Love my phone
Awesome phone
It is so cool
Great phone. Love all the features that were described! Thanks Amazon!
As an Amazon prime member, i decided to try fire phone. At first I was very disappointed with the short battery life, the heat issue and the under-performance of firefly. but after a week's use these shortcoming becomes not as important. The fire phone is fast and the general experience is alright, not too much different from Kindle Fire HDX.<br/><br/>Here is my impression of the fire phone:<br/>Cons:<br/>1 day battery life;<br/>warm phone as you use it;<br/>firefly can't recoganize many objects;<br/>also, the map is not as good as google's<br/>limited apps;<br/><br/>Pro:<br/>amazon ecosystem;<br/>fast phone;<br/>dynamic perspective seems fun but need more contents/apps for that to be meaningful;<br/>as far as limitation of apps you can sideload apps if you want.<br/><br/>buy it if you love Amazon's prime service, otherwise you can wait as Amazon makes it really standing out.
Kicks my old ipoo's rear! It was time to upgrade, and I was sick of how slow my old phone was on sending texts, surfing the web, and the audio quality on the calls. This Fire is ON FIRE! It is screamingly fast in both in comparison to my old ipoo, and my daughter's new galaxy.  For me this phone is a breath of fresh air after fighting my old phone on trying to hear calls.
I love this phone. This is my first smart phone and it was so easy to use.  It takes great pictures too.
I love it, just wish I could play my game "Cookie Jam" on here.. other that, it's a great phone.
Can not change the keyboard to other popular apps. WiFi has to be turned on manually. Battery only lasts one day without making any calls. Limited screen lock, no lock patterns. Amazon has only limited apps. Can't access Google play. My purchased apps from Google can't be installed in this phone. Wish I could have bought another phone. Very disappointed with Amazon.
Amazing graphics I love streaming video on this device. Easy to use.
There many things I don't like. Not being able to change the font size is the main one for me. The messages are in very small font. and I have to increases it with my fingers every time. The three time tapping is very annoying to me. I like to be able to change the backgrounds. I would like a better way to arrange my phonebook. I wish it had a light bulb letting me know when I have a message or when the phone is charged and there are all the apps. I can't get. It needs more colors, all this dark or light backgrounds are depressing.
While I'm not especially pleased this issue has not yet been resolved since the week I've first reported it (and I'm surprised this is not an easy fix), Dean was both polite and professional (not to mention patient: I have spoken to a number of other non-Amazon reps of late, and they all seem eager to argue and interrupt: not the case with Dean or any of the other Amazon reps I've been in contact with, so thank you for that, too).  He also seemed quite honestly and thoroughly happy with his thankless 4-day weekend work schedule.
i guess it's because i am used to my galaxy.i have been able to find apps. so its no problem with this.still learning how to use the phone. have to find if the camera has features only play one game and gets very hot quickly,so i avoid the game. i guess i will give another review when i learn more about the phone. has a glitch sometimes when i press to see the home screen it just turns off and refuses to show me the page so i have to press the top button.hopefully i will get to learn how to work with it and get to like it a lot.
The Fire could be MUCH better.I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.
Great phone!
Great phone.
Great phone.
Easy to use.
Great! phone
I hate having to have my MOBILE DATA on to get pictures in text messages. I HATE that the phone automatically and randomly connects to any wifi available, and has no real MANUAL option to turn that off. I hate that it doesn't accept GOOGLE PLAY apps and you have to download a separate app which them downloads google play apps. Overall, the best thing about the phone so far has been cloud storage, camera, using firefly occasionally, battery charge life is fantastic, and getting a free subscription to Amazon prime.
I returned an iPhone for this one, I love it.not as complicated.
Great phone better than the iPhone equal to Samsung had both before fire phone love it! Awesome!
We love it.
Great phone
Great phone
Works great
Yes<br/>Ok
Love it! 💚
Great phone
something happened last night.  I changed the screen saver picture and then everything headed south.  I couldnt access the internet.  Open camera, no.  I had set the alarms so I fell asleep, noting that the word FIRE came on the closed screen.  No alarms today.  I guess I'll have to take it to the dealer.  I guess it could be my fault who knows.  dont post this, I dont mind.  I've not been disappointed by a purchase from amazon but once.  Good track record.
This phone has been nothing but problem after problem.  I wanted to love the phone just like my tablet but it is not the same.  This phone, for the price, was not worth it.  It lags, it deletes short cuts, the talk to text won't work half the time, and it goes overly sensitive with the Swype too.  And you are not able to use the goggle play store.  Not a phone I would buy ever again.  If you need a phone for just making calls get something that costs less.
It's more than just a phone. I don't know that much about computers, but my phone does!
This would be a awesome phone if only it allowed the use of google play and google services. Its basically a Android operating system but heavily veiled with amazons fire os. If you dont rely on google apps such as chromecast etc then this is actually a pretty nice phone with some useful features.
Not as well crafted and as well thought out as I would have though an Amazon product would be.  WERE IS THE BACK BUTTON!  Plus the screen continues to go black and freeze constantly.  The font is to small and there is no font app to change the size.  The zoom feature is not much of a help.  I had very high hopes for this phone and was let down on so many levels.  I even switched to AT&T; in order to get this phone and I was screwed on both fronts.  SMH
To be honest and blunt I HATED this phone! If I could give this phone less than one star I would. I would not recommend this phone even to kindle users. I thought that I would enjoy the phone because I had a kindle and I love my kindle. I thought the fire phone had neat features that I would enjoy like the 3D and the mayday button turns out that the only reason you need the mayday button is because the phone sucks! There is no personalization not even the ability to change font or basic background color. Hardly any of the apps worked for me even the ones that worked on my kindle didn't work on this phone. The interface was a kindle that was slapped onto a device that fits into your pocket. The only thing going for the phone was the 3D graphics. I went with the IPhone 6 and it also has the 3d technology I liked but a WAY better phone that I am much happier with. Sorry Amazon but this device was a flop! I wouldn't recommend even trying this phone. Not even the free year of prime made it worth it.
Unable to get Yahtze for Buddies on it. Also unable to get Bank of America app on it.
Love it. Awesome phone. I was a little sceptical at first, but it was a great choice
This will be a great phone by probably the third generation. If Amazon lifts their app ban just a little bit. I like this phone in general, but the lack of popular and/or apps that function properly is frustrating. Please, Amazon, allow regular android apps to work on your platform.
awesome phone and more can do more then most other phones and the 3D is awesome !!!
Love it. Having fun learning all the things I can do with it glad I got it:-):-):-)
Love it. Convert from iPhone 5 and prefer fire phone.
Best phone ever. Well I think so since this is my first smart phone. The help button is awesome. The people really take the time to help you. The firefly button really captures numbers off business cards. It downloads apps really easy. I will have this phone a long time......
Didn't Light My Fire ... I think it’s completely unnecessary that many of the Fire's key features, like unlimited cloud photo storage, are supported by Amazon's data centers that are powered by coal and other dirty energy. If Amazon matched competitors like Apple by powering their operations with clean and renewable energy, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.
Love it !!
Nice phone
I like it.
Dope phone
It's great
I Love it.
Nice phone
Awesome phone. It syncs up to my tablet. Let the Amazon service rule the world!!!
Just wish it would have more apps and it is not simple to get outside .apk files.
Really enjoying this phone. It's different in ways than both the iPhone and droids, such as it has no back button. But, once you figure out that, it's not bad.  The carousel is nice, keeping your favorite or frequently used apps together you just swipe though. You can pin your most used ones and remove them if you wish. Oh, and did I mention the prime membership??  Haven't used the mayday button yet, but it is available.
The inability to download my banking app was my first disappointment, then its freezing when messaging. I find it hard to negotiate "back" to anything. The screen can be overly sensitive, opening apps or the phone system seemingly on its own. After having it for two weeks I am getting used to it, and I have to say in its favor that I like it's simplicity. I think as I get to know it better, I will like it more.
I love my fire phone.  Or maybe I'm still in denial.  Amazon's app store is severely lacking.  Everything is only available through Google or Apple...which this phone does not support.  I was happy to be google free .....but now...I'm counting the days till I can upgrade phones and get rid of this thing.  Also it's started freezing up, especially when using camera.  I can handle that...but not the lack of useful apps
Great phone. After I downloaded the Google play store on it it was just perfect.
I like it works great for everything I do and need.
LOVE this Phone,  i read the reviews and everyone complains " no google play store" READ the description, it's a AMAZON FIRE,not a google phone. I think the apps are just as good if not better. As for Battery life, i am very pleased, BLOWS my old Samsung away
Owned less than a year. Cases hard to find. Found the best one I could. Loaded google, etc. Eventually my emails started not showing up for days. Then texts wouldn't show up. Calls weren't coming through. Then a few weeks later I go to bed with sound and wake up with absolutely no sound. Never dropped or banged the phone up. This phone could have been awesome but...I don't know what the Hell happened to it.
Its hard to figure out how to turn the music and camera off.. otherwise it OK!
Battery life isn't so great but the rest of the phone exceeded my expectations
I love my Fire phone. I refused to purchase a smartphone. I did not want to pay for the data or the cost of a phone. Since your plan options have changed and it is financially worth having the extras and the fact the Fire phone was so reasonable, I chose to try something out of my comfort zone. I know the Fire phone is disappointing to some, but I would not change my mind.<br/><br/>Marlena K. Scott
Easy and fun to use. Just need to allow google app store apps to be installed
Booooooo...runs on dirty coal. Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. I am upset that one of the Fire’s key features, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, comes with a hidden and harmful cost. Unlike Apple and Google who have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s data centers are powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary. Clean it up Amazon.
The phone is exactly what I was wanting, It lives up to its expectations. I do hope that at some point all the google apps will work on it, there are some I used on a daily basis on my old android that I can't use on The fire phone... One being Wattpad.
Pretty good for being a 1st-generation product: it has many features that it took Apple, Google, and Microsoft several releases to deliver. However, there's still some work to do. There's some apps on this platform that are not being developed by the original companies (Microsoft Word, MyFitnessPal), and other developers are selling crappy versions of the app. Also, there's no PagerDuty app!
I got this phone as a replacement for my iPhone 5. I was initially disappointed with not being able to access my other Android purchases from Google Play. I have found a way to make that work now and am very pleased with the phone. It has a very nice large screen that is easy to read. The performance is quick and smooth. I would recommend this to others not caught up in the Apple world.
Have swipe issues and has to be restarted to correct itself  it gets slow at times and dialing a number really takes forever I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be considering it cost so much.<br/>Finally figured out how to get ringtones
When will it be sold so far I love it I wish to get one for my wife thanks
I love it. But... while using it is very Hot. I hope the baterry life last
I love it
Cool fone
So far ok
best ever
I love it
Love it!!
I like it
I like it
I love it
Excellent
Awesome!!
I love it

At first, I wasn't so sure.  But after having for 3 days and getting used to it after switching from the IPhone 4, I am really starting to like it.  Love the Free Year of Amazon Prime, which mine was just about to renew, so that was covered just in time.  I think if you are an Amazon Prime member, you could love this phone.  I like how it has the swivel to get to the side windows.  Getting used to the ring tones and alarm sounds.  The action time for Apps, seems much faster than for the I Phone I previously had. The camera can be activated automatically by pushing the lower left button without unlocking your phone, and the clarity of pics is pretty clear.  Firefly is pretty cool:  Just take a picture of a book or DVD or TV show, even, your interested in, and the info and reviews will pop up on your screen.  The Voice activated look up feature works really well.  Just hold the main button down and say what you want it to find, and it will look for you.  I just got my first I-phone 2 years ago with the I-phone 3 when it was free on upgrade, and thought that was magic, so again so far I am liking this phone. . .I also like to read on my phone so there's more space on the phone for reading books, watching shows, listening to music, etc.<br/><br/>Now I am having a problem with streaming music.  I would think if it is downloaded, you could play the music, and not have streaming issues.  Might be just the Wi-Fi, but this is getting annoying. . .<br/><br/>Also annoying that they can't automatically let you look up ITunes online and download the music you bought from I-Tunes.  On my I Phone, I could get Prime Music on it.  Their App Store is also lacking in Apps.  Amazon has enough share in the market don't they.  They need to allow us to access our Apps and Music Previously downloaded on other devices.<br/><br/>Monkey Buddy App that came on the phone was great to keep my one year old niece and pre-k nephew entertained for a good half hour or more while we waiting for an airplane to take off.  This app also displays the featured DYNAMIC PERSPECTIVE, which is when you move the phone around you, the game or app is supposed to move with you.
The phone looks way too better than it works. Too many bugs and glitches.
Great phone! Easy to use, nice camera, easy to learn. Love my kindle app!
Would have bought this except for the huge footprint it leaves in the planet. C'mon Amazon, get with it. Be a part of the solution, not part of the problem. Until then, Buh Bye
I like this thing a lot and is much easier to use than most androids. The absolute only problem and it's a big one is that I am mostly limited to the Amazon App store, which wouldn't be a problem if they actually carried enough of the most common apps.  There are ways around it but it's a really annoying process to side load apps when I should be able to just download them.
love it - having fun using it & connecting with friends around the world
This phone is absolutely amazing! I'm still learning just how much this phone can do. Compared to my friends I phones my pictures and videos are way better than theirs ( not to brag). The apps are at least equal to what theirs are. My options are so vast i haven't checked them all out yet. I Live in an area where signals are weak but this phone picks them up just fine.
One of the best phones to come out in a while. Amazon Fire Phone has cool "3D" visuals and a fresh OS design, and it hits the sweet spot for one-handed operation. It has deep, convenient integration with Amazon services.
Had some trouble connecting with WiFi, but technical support fixed it.
I love the phone,,it nice,, but, it is very slippery , after have it for just 3 days it fell out of my hands and it broke as soon as it hit the ground, never had a phone do that before,, now I cannot get parts to repair it,, nor can I fine any one to repair it ,, it now a useless phone unit I can get it repair,, should come with a case that not so slippery!!!!
It's not the best phone nor is it the worst.
I love the design of this phone and the sound quality. But I am disappointed that I cannot pair it and use it in my car. The Bluelink app ( which allows me to remote start my car, lock and unlock the doors, etc.) is not available. I<br/>don't have any kids, so a lot of the apps do not appeal to me. I have been a Samsung Galaxy user for a long time so having an opportunity to try another phone was appealing.  Unfortunately I did not purchase it at $.99, I am paying the full price through At&t;'s Next program so I am stuck with this phone for two years. So I hope during this period that more adult apps are included in the store and the Hyundai Bluelink app is added, as well as being able pair with the phone setup in my car.
The problem is not the phone, it is CONTRACT with AT&T.; The moment Amazon can break free with carriers such of AT&T; and Verizon by using its Whisper network, the phone should take off. Most consumes detest AT&T; and Verizon.
Very nice phone, I wish they made a hard case with credit card slots
I'm still getting the hang of this phone,but its a pretty good phone
Excellent phone. Regularly coming updates and software improvements.
Be progressive & opportunistic and go green. Don't neglect your duty and show responsibility for our planet!
I wish it was more compatible with Google.
Still getting used to it but it's awesome!
Had this phone for 9 months, no problems from this phone. I love it
It works great, back lite stays on until I shut I it down manually.
Fire phone has gone beyond my expectations. It is a really good buy
Best phone I have ever had.  Meets and exceeds all my expectations.
I'm giving this phone 2 stars, ONLY because Amazon is sending me a LG G3 to replace this phone, and because they've truly been so nice to me throughout this whole experience.<br/><br/>I have had my Fire Phone replaced 4 times in 3 months (I've been through 5 of these phones)<br/>Believe me when I tell you this is not a good phone, yes the camera is great, display is awesome, and Amazon prime is a great deal breaker for some when getting the phone, but there arent many other good qualities. Limited applications to download, never could get the Google play to work on this phone correctly.<br/><br/>Phone won't play music most of the time, just gives you a loading spin dial where the play button is.<br/><br/>Sometimes the keyboard will just disappear and you can't respond to texts, emails, Facebook; etc until you reboot the phone.<br/><br/>I've noticed that out of the 5 phones, 3 of them will just randomly shut off and won't let you power the phone back on until you plug it into a charger, even if the battery is fully charged.<br/><br/>Silk Browser has many glitches, you click on something and it'll click whatever's above it instead of what you want, type a new url in the browser and it'll just reload the same page like it forgot what you just typed in.<br/><br/>Dynamic perspective just makes you dizzy, and will start to annoy you after a while, I always leave it turned off.<br/><br/>As far as Bluetooth goes, I have a 14 MZ6 and the phone hardly ever let's me connect to the car, and when it does a lot of the time it'll play my music in slow motion. Weird.<br/><br/>This phone has great build quality, very sturdy and attractive, but it's still got many software issues that Amazon should've fixed before releasing the phone, I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone, but would recommend Amazon to everyone because their customer service is A+ great, and they really do care about their customers.<br/>Thank you Amazon for making an exception for me and sending me a better device to replace this phone which is full of unresolved issues.
I've had my Fire phone for a little over three months.  When initially researching smartphones, I decided to ignore those reviews that dinged the Fire for not being a typical Android, for not being compatible with Google apps, etc.  Since it was going to be my first smartphone (after being a basic phone and iPod Touch user for several years), I figured I could use the Fire without having any preconceived notions and therefore avoid disappointment.  After all, I was no more invested in the Google universe than Gmail, which I'd still be able to use.  I'd also never used an Android, so I didn't have any pre-set habits.<br/><br/>In the end, I chose the Fire for its price and camera.  Here are my conclusions after 3 months:<br/><br/>1.)  The actual phone part is just fine.  Absolutely no complaints.<br/>2.)  The display is very clear and sharp.  The Dynamic Perspective thing is neat, but I keep it off most of the time to preserve battery life (I'm not a heavy game player).<br/>3.)  Having instant connection to the Amazon store is pretty handy, but I have a feeling that it's not significantly different than having an Amazon app on any other phone.<br/>4.)  Firefly is neat and VERY quick in the few instances I've tried the music ID.  Product ID is a little hit-or-miss.<br/>5.)  I don't see much point in Mayday, but I haven't had any problems that I couldn't look up in the phone's help guide.<br/>6.)  The camera...oh, the camera.  I have two different regular cameras that I use heavily, but I wanted something that could snap an occasional GOOD photo when I don't have my "real" cameras with me.  The camera on my iPod Touch had been pretty crummy, so I was excited about getting something that was supposed to have better clarity and an actual flash.  Unfortunately, the camera has been a complete disappointment (for me).  If you're thinking about getting the Fire and the camera quality makes a difference to you, be honest with yourself about the type of pictures you're going to be taking.  If you want to take lots of outdoor (read: sufficient natural lighting) photos, landscape shots, and stationary indoor shots, you'll probably be happy.  Those types of photos turn out quite nicely.  If you want to take a single, solitary picture of your kids or your pets, don't count on the Fire's camera to capture the shot.  (Unless your kids or pets are really good at posing, holding perfectly still, and keeping their eyes open.)  The flash takes forever, the "shutter" takes forever, and chances are pretty good that your toddler or your dog will be long gone before the camera actually takes the shot of whatever cute thing they had been doing.  If it does capture them, the pics are usually completely out of focus, whitewashed, or blurry.<br/>7.)  I didn't think it would make a lot of difference, but the number of apps that I have not been able to get on the Fire phone is pretty annoying.<br/><br/>All things considered, I'm not as happy with the Fire phone as I would have liked to be.  I think there's a lot of potential here, but when it comes time to upgrade, I doubt I'll be staying with the Fire phone unless a.) they work on Google compatibility and b.) camera improvements are made.
Great
***Updated on August 1st, 2014***  I returned the phone and went back to my iPhone 5.  I could get past not being able to organize apps into folders, the phone getting hot, the apps such as AppStore failing to open (more on that later), and the terrible battery life, but the lack of apps that I use for business and travel not being available killed it for me.<br/><br/>If you use this phone for work, there are MUCH better options out there, as this seems to be targeted to those people who only use their smartphone for calls, texts, pictures, and games.  I'm sure apps are in the works, but I can't afford to halt my productivity to wait around for them to be available on the Amazon App Store when they're readily available elsewhere.  IHG, QQ, Southwest Airlines, Delta Airlines, National Car Rental, Hertz, Avis, Budget Car Rental, Target, Wal-Mart, Best Buy, YouTube (Since it's a Google App and you can't download any of them), heck, even HayDay isn't available!  For me personally, it just wasn't a good fit due to most of the apps I use on a daily basis aren't available.<br/><br/>Lastly, NUMEROUS times I'd try to open the Appstore and the app would crash.  I'd click on the icon, it would load for less than a second and then return me to the Carousel.  I called MayDay and they walked me through some tech support steps, as she'd never seen this before either.  I had to go into the Manage Applications setting and clear the data.  I opened the app fine after I did this.  It became a pain though to have to do this almost every other time I went to the Appstore.  It also started doing this when using other apps, such as trying to open the Music Store, and when accessing the Newsstand.  I know this is the first iteration of the Fire Phone, so there are going to be issues, but unfortunately, this smartphone is leaps and bounds behind other options that are available.<br/><br/>I changed my rating from 4 stars to 3, because it's not a terrible phone, it just doesn't do what I need it to.  For others, it might be perfect.  Sorry Amazon.  I wanted to love it, but I wanted a phone upgrade, not a new phone that doesn't do what I need it to.<br/>*****************<br/><br/>Original Review---I picked up the Amazon Fire phone on July 25th and have spent the weekend getting myself acclimated with it.  I've had an iPhone 5 previously, and have had nothing but iPhone's since the iPhone 3G, so this is my first foray into the android phone world.  I have a Kindle Fire that I love, as well as 2 other android based tablets, so I figure I'd give this phone a try.<br/><br/>To start, the interface itself I don't really care for.  You want to download your music from Amazon Music, or add in apps you have on the cloud, it puts EVERYTHING you recently have touched into the Carousel on your phone's home screen.  There's no way to turn this off and only keep things you use most often there, and there's no way to delete multiple items from the Carousel at the same time.  So when you load 30 different things onto your phone, be prepared to click on them one by one and select "Remove from Carousel" to get it off of there.  I called MayDay and asked if there was a way to arrange items in the Carousel, and they confirmed that there is not.<br/><br/>Secondly, this phone gets hot.  I've never experienced using a phone that could double as a hand warmer in the cooler months.  My kids were using it to play games and commented on how hot the phone was getting after only a couple minutes of playing the pre-installed game "Monkey Buddy".<br/><br/>The biggest let down for me so far are the apps.  Having a Kindle Fire, I thought I knew what to expect app wise, but I was majorly let down.  I travel for my job and always check in to flights using my iPhone as a digital boarding pass.  As of this review on 7/28/2014, there are no travel apps for Southwest Airlines or Delta Airlines.  So instead of being able to check in from a simple app, I have to go to their website on the phone and manually enter everything in.<br/><br/>I use the Bank of America app to check my bank account when on the go, but a quick search of the Appstore from my phone found no app.  I went to Amazon's website on my PC and searched for the Bank of America app, and low and behold, there it was.  It even had a menu on the side stating that it was compatible for my Fire Phone, despite it being labeled as Bank of America App for Kindle Fire Tablet.  I chose to download the app from my computer, went back to the app store on my phone to search again, and it's not there.  From there, I clicked the Sync button on my phone, then went and viewed apps that were in my cloud, and there was the Bank of America app.  I clicked to download it to my phone and it downloaded, installed, and works perfectly fine.  I have no idea why Amazon's website shows apps that are compatible with the Fire Phone, but are unavailable to be found on the Appstore on the phone.  If you can't find an app you're looking for, as dumb as it sounds, trying checking the appstore on the website and not from the phone.<br/><br/>The camera seems to be fine.  It takes pictures, and that's that.  The Dynamic Maps that are bragged about and shown off are only available for 4 cities, Seattle, San Francisco, New York, and Chicago.  You want to see a 3D model of the city you live in?  Well, I hope you live in one of the 4 listed above because if you don't, you get the regular ol GPS maps you can see anywhere else.<br/><br/>I haven't decided yet if I'm going to keep it or return it and wait for the iPhone 6.  With the lack of apps that I use on a day to day basis for work and travel, it disheartens me to not be able to do what I'm used to while on the move.  If you just want to make some phone calls and play some games, this phone works perfectly.  But, if your phone is you mobile briefcase that you depend on from a work perspective, it's just not there yet.
I am relatively new to smart phones.  I had an LG Envy Touch several years ago and HATED it.  I ended up using it to only make calls and text because it sucked so much. The day the contract was up I was taking a hammer to it.<br/><br/>I pre-ordered the Fire phone throught AT&T; and picked it up last Thursday.  Everything went seamlessly including transferring my contacts from my old pre-paid phone. No problems with phone calls or texts.  And the sound during the phone calls is very clear.  I can actually understand what people are saying!<br/><br/>It feels very much like my Kindle Fire HDX. It is set up very similarly so the set up of the home screen was very familar to me. The carousel was something I was already using and like.  When I don't need it I just change the page to my apps. I was already a Prime member so loved having all my content already on my phone as soon as it was registered with Amazon.  Having all the Amazon content was a big draw for me.<br/><br/>I see people who seem to be surgically attached to their phone.  That is not me.  I don't live on it.  I text, make phone calls and use it for specific apps and the internet.  It meets my needs as the apps I use a lot (I have a iPod) are available.  My Prime music is readily available along with my TV shows, movies and books.  The sound when listening to my music is great.  It sounds as good, if not better, than my iPod.  I only listen with headphones so I can't comment to the sound of the speakers. One bit of confusion for me.  I see reviews where people say they can't get their Gmail.  I logged into my Gmail account when I set up my phone.  Now it is on my home screen and tells me when I have a new email.  Am I missing something?<br/><br/>There are a few things that I am dissatisfied with.  The battery life is terrible.  It was down to about 39% percent after a day spent at work.  And I actually work.  Not sit at my desk and just play on my phone.  It doesn't take much to use it up. No emojis on my texts and no time stamp when a text is received.  And where are the custome ringtones? That just seems like lazy design. It is a bit big and clunky looking but feels like a solid phone.  It could be less expensive.  Amazon is probably going to have to change this if it wants to be competitive. I wish I could sync it with my chrome.  Hopefully that will be coming.<br/><br/>Is it a perfect phone?  No, but what is right out of the gate. For me the positives outweigh the negatives and I am very happy with it.  I don't forsee breaking out my hammer in two years.<br/><br/>ETA:  It does show the time a text is received.  Just have to use Peek.
I like it! This phone has done everything I've tried so far, and then some, with one exception - I can't get it to sync my Fitbit One. Yet.<br/><br/>I wanted to test this phone against the others to see how it stacks up. I have Fire HDX tablet as well. The Dynamic Perspective is very cool. Haven't put Firefly to work yet. Just testing all the basic apps, email, etc., to make sure it does all the the daily use things I need. So far, so good. It performs as well and in some cases, better than the other smartphones i've used. The high def is excellent. The one-hand features like side menus are a plus.<br/><br/>I like the heft of this phone, and amazon has stayed with their dimension ratios they use in their tablets - longer and narrower - which fits my hand better than my Galaxy. Here's a short video of the phone's 'Dynamic Perspective'with the interavtive "Monkey Buddy" - the vacuum cleaner background noises do not come with the phone ;)<br/><br/>Amazon's new Fire Smartphone: http://youtu.be/Yka75mSEW7s<br/><br/>Stay tuned - my guess is, this is only the beginning :)
Love it!
Love it!
Awesome!
The s***
awesome phone. great camera. not the best app store but it's good.
Can't get some apps I need. So I have to carry the tablet as well.
Battery doesn't last to long but other then that it's a good phone
Dirty energy does not work for me!<br/>Come on, you can do better.<br/>Please come up with a green source energy program.
love it still playing with features but am amazed all that i have
Love it!!!! So easy to use and so much quicker than my old phone.
I want to upgrade my fire phone... Amazon, please bring it back.
Wonderful phone does just about anything you want a phone to do.
I like my Fire Phone!  I've used it primarily as a telephone with voice and text messaging, and I love that I can read my Kindle books on it.  I am a slow learner with technology, so I haven't used many apps.  However, when I need help, the friendly FirePhone helper is right there with the flick of a button.  Thanks, Amazon!
The grafics are great. Works very well and fast. But can't find some the apps I had before and I have to press the home button 5 times to make it unlock but the power button does that well. It a very sturdy phone and seams to grip well in hand. Would give 5stars if not for the apps and home button not unlocking phone right.
Nuclear, coal, and dirty energy is not a smart choice that you made in creating the Amazon Fire phone.  Consider our environment and<br/>please clean up this otherwise smart invention.
It’s time to put out the Fire! It makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud is not a strong selling point, especially when competitors like Apple are using 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon can commit to using modern energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.
liked it but just didnt like the software really needs snapchat
Terrible environmental policies
It's going to take some getting used to but so far  I like it.
I love this phone it has done everything I have wanted it too. The only down fall is I can't access the play store. But I do love it by far the best phone I've used.. great job guys.. try connecting it with Google play as well and what will it hurt just think amazon and Google pairing on this phone would be amazing
I received this as my birthday gift.  I love it in every way.
really enjoying my phone love all the apps,mayday it's great.
The Fire could be MUCH better.I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.
I love the phone the camera is awsome
Just what I wanted.  I especially like that it syncs to my e-reader.  I use Prime so thanks for the free year.  I find the battery life adequate and it takes about 4 hours to recharge.
Love it but wish there was a life proof or water proof case
Best phone I've ever had. I love the amazon prime features.
Freezes constantly when using apps and when using silk browser. Just not as user friendly as I had hoped. Sometimes doesn't ring when receiving a call. Will not recommend this phone.
I have been waiting and waiting for the fire phone to become more user friendly and cheaper.  Has not happened yet.  My husband got the ATT deal for it.  He is much more patient than I am with new things or should I say toys.  My son said Mom wait awhile til they tweak it up.  Lol. Thank you son.
I have owned my phone since July 2014.. I do like it But the biggest draw back is Google does not support the fire. So aopa I need I cannot get so if this does not change u will be get to g another phone that will<br/> It's a shame be cause I really like it.. Amazon needs to rethink  their apps.
This phone does so many things. Press and hold the home button and tell it what to do such as call home. It will dictate a text message very well. It will search for whatever you're needing to find on your phone with the exception of a few things that are in progress. The more you play with it the more things you will find it will do.It is truly amazing.  People giving it a bad review have probably not figured out how smart this phone is. Maps works great. Gmail as well as email from cable provider works great. Firefly excellent. Video really good. Contacts, photos, books, etc were there immediately due to syncing with kindle fire HDX. When I added photos to my contacts, they immediately showed up on my husband's contacts! The only issue I have had is the visual voicemail which seems to only work on Wi-Fi. I wish people would stop the negative reviews until they have figured out how to use the phone.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Yesterday, Amazon dropped the price to .99¢. I feel betrayed for the very first time by Amazon.  The die hard Amazon fans preordered trusting Amazon on this new venture. Don't get me wrong. I LOVE my Fire phone, but now feel I should have waited a couple of months and saved a lot of money. I would not trade the phone for any other one. It is so easy to use and ties all my Amazon stuff together, just wish those of us who have never failed Amazon would have been rewarded instead of jilted. :(<br/><br/>UPDATE: I did contact Amazon and they did make it right. They are the best customer service of any company. Also, I still love my phone. If people would take the time to learn how to use it instead of being so quick to judge, I'm sure this phone would be a huge hit. I would say I hope Amazon keeps improving the phone, except I think it is already pretty awesome.
Love it
Awesome
I've it
I am taking it slow learning but everything is going well.
I am still learning how to use it, but I do really like t.
Volume not loud enough. Phone was purchased by my girlfriend on amazon but put on my At&t; Cell Plan. She got the free year of Amazon Prime added to her current Amazom Prime Account but no Free year of Amazon Prime on the Fire Phone because it is linked to my Amazon account, Very Unfortunate
There were so many things I loved about it (Firefly, display, etc.), but it wouldn't work with the apps I needed. In the end, it was just an expensive toy with poor battery life, so I returned it. I don't think Amazon really thought this through. Such great potential and such poor delivery.
Great phone and really easy to use.
Yes indeed great phone and services
Needs better software and More apps
Great phone, amazing pictures camera is out of this world
Love the phone now; but if I had it to do all over, I would wait until Amazon gets all the bugs worked out.
I love my Fire phone, it's the best and so simple to use.  I got rid of my OLD flip open phone, not complaining, it was a good ole phone, but it was a dinosaur.  I finally decided to come into the 21st century :-)<br/>I guess by now you know I love my Fire phone.  I highly recommend it.
An under rated but amazing device.
I like the phone, now I feel ripped off.  I got the new Fire just over two weeks ago, and paid $199 for it. Now they're selling it for  $.99.  The value of a phone doesn't change by $200 in two weeks.  They've got two hundred bucks of my money they obviously shouldn't have, and it pisses me off.  I went from a fairly happy customer to a totally pissed off one in in two weeks time.  I hate how cell phone vendors do this to their customers.<br/><br/>The phone works fine, and I won't go back to iphones; but I may never buy another Amazon phone either due to being treated worse than a lot of other customers.<br/><br/>***** Update****  I was contacted by Amazon and they are making customers who bought the phone before the sale whole with a refund of the difference.  I was shocked and very pleasantly surprised.  Ask Apple to do that for you and see what happens.  My entire problem with Amazon was quickly resolved, and I now have a phone I like a lot more than the iphone 5C that crapped out on me.  For $.99 you can't go wrong.  This phone is as good as any iphone I used, and is just going to get better as they work the initial bugs out and get more apps for it.  Amazon has proven once again to be a stand up company.  I recently purchased Fire TV which is also awesome by the way.  With a Prime membership that comes with this phone, the Fire TV is a streaming media dream.  I have a Kindle for reading; but I'm really inclined to replace my old ipad with a Fire tablet.  Amazon is making it easy to transition away from Apple; except for my laptop\desktop computing needs where I'll stick with Apple a while longer.
I like it. Kinda slow sometimes, some features odd and weird to adjust to some apps not available but overall a good phone. Once you get used to it. I the features it does have. Nav good linked to amazon and free prime all sick. I stick with amazon if they keep marketing phones.
At first I really liked my phone but the longer I have had it the more I grow to hate it. The thing that really bothers me is the Amazon app store has NOTHING!! I have learned not to buy things that have to be linked to your phone with an app because this phone cannot do that.
Lots to like about the phone, but having its own apps kill it.  Most are not up to dates as my older phones and some just don't work right.<br/><br/>I am fine with the battery life, signal, and almost everything else, but the apps or lack of good ones is a big show stopper.
The auto scroll is making me mad.
The  best phone I have ever owned
Let's start with price. $199 that ties you into a two year contract with AT&T; unless you do the next program which then means your paying full price $649 for the phone. I bought my Fire HDX for half the price.<br/><br/>Battery life is a huge disappointment and compares nothing to what is advertised.<br/><br/>Dynamic Perspective is cool but can also be a pain or headache. Thankfully you can turn it off.<br/><br/>Firefly only works half the time.<br/><br/>Lack of google apps and a few more I use on a daily basis. You would think they have had time to expand their app selection by now.<br/><br/>Size it is definitely a bit larger and heavier than my iPhone 5S<br/><br/>It seems only targeted to people that are amazon shoppers/users. The cost of the phone doesn't become any better just because you get a year of Amazon Prime free.<br/><br/>I definitely think they have a couple of updates and price changes that need to be made before this can compete with iPhone or the hottest new android, Galaxy 5.<br/><br/>I only got to use the phone because I happen to work for unamed cellular company. ;).  It hasn't been flying off the shelves either.
I really wanted to like this phone.  I have used Kindle Fire tablets, and like the carousel home screen, it always picks up where you left off.  The Fire Phone does the same thing, very well.  You can see email from the carousel without opening the app, very handy and convenient.  Most of the troubles I had may be related to AT&T.;  Dropped calls, txt messages delayed an hour or more.  Very frustrating.  The worst was when the built in apps - phone , messaging, etc disappeared.  I couldn't find them in Amazon app store.  My phone was basically a mini tablet.  I was able to use the MayDay app, and tech support appeared right away.  We could not figure out how to restore the phone app.  I finally did a google search and the only option was to do a factory reset.  Tech support agreed that would be the only way.<br/><br/>Other problems I had were the phone shutting off without my realizing it.  And the flick of the wrist thing worked about half of the time.<br/><br/>Pros - Nice design, great screen for watching TV/Movies and sounds pretty good.  Like the home screen setup.  Firefly worked well on finding products, songs, movies, very handy.<br/><br/>Cons - AT&T; service really bad.  Quirks with software or hardware that occasionally didn't work as designed.<br/><br/>Maybe the next version will be better.  I went back to my iPhone 4s and Verizon.
Great phone. It's like having 4 phones in one  IE; it works similar to a I phone, Samsung Galaxy, Palm if any of you remember that phone and a phone of it's own. Love the fetchers in this phone, but still trying to master them. I would recommend this phone to everyone!!
I write this review sadly. It wad new phone time and I really wanted the Samsung Galaxy S5 but when I seen the Amazon fire phone just came out I had to get it. I love all things Amazon so I thought I must have this phone. $650.00 on the next plan at AT&T; nit worth it. By far my biggest consumerism mistakes to date. In fairness my sales person was in training and made me believe I was paying $199.00 with a contract. Boy was he wrong. There is no way Amazon lover or not I would have knowingly paid 650.00 for this phone.<br/>Let me out in some positives.<br/>1. Good camera, but not great. By spouse went with the Galaxy S5 and that camera is 10xs better then mine.<br/>2. Prime. But I would have paid the year subscription versus this phone.<br/>3. All of my kindle cloud stuff transferred to me phone.<br/>4. The size is prefect.<br/>5. Firefly is a cool feature but similar apps are on other phones.<br/>The negatives:<br/>1: Not Google friendly.<br/>2. Not all apps are available.<br/>3. Constantly freezes so I have to restart.<br/>4. The fitbit app will not auto synch. I have to use my laptop and synch periodically. This is a shame especially since the fitbit is one of Amazon's top selling items. I believe number 28.<br/>5. Low battery life.<br/>All in all this phone is basically a small kindle that you can make calls on.
Great first real phone! Easy to learn for 61year old.
loving the phone so far. had to figure out how to get my contacts transferred from a Nokia Lumia, but got it done and working on pairing it with SYNC in my car.
not as nice of a phone as the page made it out to be
My wife and I both have this phone and we love them.
It's great, still learning different things about it
I too am very disappointed with my Fire Phone. This is my first smartphone and I get a lemon!  It freezes, disconnects from wi-fi, sometimes in the middle of something.  I have to reboot everyday to connect to wi-fi.  The flick of the hand trick does not work for me but you can slide it over and see what you need.  The biggest disappointment is the inability to download Google apps.  I was so looking forward to using my Starbucks account on my new "smartphone".  It's a great looking phone and feels great but it does run hot to the touch...luckily I don't use it much so its not an issue. Lately my calendar has been loosing appointments.  Maybe a future generation of the phone will work better.  Don't bother if you are a smartphone user...you won't be happy. Sorry Amazon.
No, I haven't bought one yet because I'm not eligible for an upgrade. I DO have a comment on the reviews I've read though (and I've read almost all of them).<br/><br/>Why have so many people slammed the Fire Phone for;<br/><br/> (1) Only being available on ATT? This is PLAINLY spelled out. Can you read before you buy? If you gave it 1 star because you bought it then realized it is only for use with ATT, then give yourself 0 stars because you're an idiot.<br/><br/>(2) Only being able to use the Amazon App Store? Do you have a brain? If you gave it 1 star because the app you HAD to have was not available in the Amazon App Store then, once again, give yourself 0 stars because you're an idiot.<br/><br/>BOTH of these were plainly spelled out if you bothered to read the description at all.<br/><br/>That said, thank you to all the great reviewers of this phone (both good and bad). There are many GREAT reviews!
I've had the Fire Phone for some couple of weeks now and love the phone!  It's simple to maneuver and quite easy to learn to do. When you purchase this phone be sure to download the updates as they fix the problems that occurred when the phone first came out.
Recently purchased Amazon's Fire Phone. Before using this phone I used iPhones, Windows phones, Android (Samsung,LG,Nokia,Motorola,iPhones 4s,5,5s). I decided to try out Fire Phone since I really like and use Amazon services. Phone built quality is very good. Phone feels solid and heavy making good first impression. Screen quality is very good, sharp and bright. Color reproduction is good since its IPS LCD. Haven't tested camera for a decent amount of time but it seems to be nice and stable. Good sharp images, OIS works the magic. Speakers are loud. Software side is different from anything I had before. Pretty intuitive interface with motion. Missing some apps from app store, can be fixed with sideloading. Overall is nice fast and solid phone with good camera.
I really love my fire phone, it is very easy to use
It's a well built device , and different from other phone's. I would rate a 5 star if I were allowed to set my pictures as a wallpaper, but cant. The amazon app market needs more apps, and users to speed up the growth and development of  the app market.
Learning how to use it,, slowly getting use to it,
Like a lot of things about it. I like fire fly app when it comes to telling me the music I'm listening to. Like that it has my apps I use. Like the creativity to the apps and screen. Has nice presentaioon. I like that you can watch videos while on the phone. Perspective mode makes interesting themes but wish it was more.<br/><br/>I wish you could customize. Limit the carousel for one and make it a favorites carousel instead. Listening to lots of music takes over the whole carousel and makes flipping through all annoying. No customized ringtones??? It's 2015....I want my ringtones and message notes tones...not Amazon's. The camera/firefly button is super sensitive. I wish it can be turned to hold for camera and not press.
Disappointed that I had to reinstall and purchase apps again. Disappointed Fire censors my apps and does not support my previous apps.<br/>Disappointed in the. Difficulty I experience in using the product.<br/>I  replacing it with a Samsung 6.
This Fire phonre has been terrific. well done and lots of great apps and the operation is smooth. The only issue is a weak signal and hopefully ATT can get it stronger in my area. Thanks Amazon nicely done all across the board your a 5 with me!!
I like it but I can't put pictures to my contacts
It's a cool phone just not as user friendly as I would have expected. Not bad for their first phone but definitely need some work. App selection is ok but limited when compared to Apple or Android. It's a work in process for sure but I enjoy it
In my perfect world, there are a few issues that I  feel should have been resolved before roll-out.  1. customize the alarm clock memo.  2. block callers (have downloaded an app that does this).  3 Voice announce only on blue tooth, I ride a motorcycle and do not like that the phone does not announce my calls or texts via blue tooth (have downloaded an app that does it). 4. A more detailed / in depth help guide.  5. Mayday uses my data allowance and that sucks, makes it difficult to use the mayday feature.  6. No Google maps available, I have many many maps saved and cannot access them.  7.  Do not have the ability to add keyboards, such as emoji to the default keyboard, so inserting symbols and such is difficult.
The Fire could be MUCH better.I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.
What can I say, I like it good phone good price.
I love it! Absolutely nothing to complain about!
The Fire has awesome graphics, options and apps.
not a good selection of aps, nice clear screen.
It is a really neat phone. I've never had an Android OS before, so it's taking some adjusting to. I lost a lot of apps coming over from Apple, hoping that the Android app store catches up soon!<br/><br/>Mayday is AWESOME. It's really, REALLY nice to have a team of people there to help me figure out this new phone and all of it's features. I've called them several times for a variety of things, and they have always been helpful and friendly.<br/><br/>The maps work really well and are very clear about giving instructions.<br/><br/>I am kind of sad you can't personalize the text message tone, at least not that I've been able to figure out.<br/><br/>Tapping on icons or trying to select something is hit and miss sometimes. Every once in a while, the screen will be too sensitive, and other times it won't be sensitive enough.<br/><br/>The locks screens are really cool and I like that they come out with new ones periodically.<br/><br/>Occasionally the screen or app I'm using will glitch. I'm not sure what the issue is exactly, but I'm sure it's just a bug fix that will be taken care of in an upcoming update.
Works great for what I need
I have loading problems all the time with this phone. Not to mention if I power the phone off it takes twice as long to power back on
I have thoroughly enjoyed this phone. I have not owned a smart phone before, so I have no basis for comparison, but it has exceeded my expectations. If an app was available for Dish Anywhere, it would be just about perfect.
Constantly freezes up. Silk Browser stops responding and has to reload at least four times a day. Reboot and reformat completely ineffective.<br/><br/>Just right now I had to retype all of this because it freaked out and backspaced everything.<br/><br/>I hope you didn't want any popular apps because they aren't there.<br/><br/>And finally, the power port is loose so if you're charging and using it, it will come undone randomly. Three times just during this review.<br/><br/>Avoid this phone at all costs.<br/><br/>It loses Wi-Fi signal constantly. Audio is terrible. The gimmick Firefly no longer works. And I hopeyou l
this phone is amazing. i love the new perspective viewing and the fire fly feature.  i cant wait to see what is going to be created to use these features further.<br/>if i had to say one negative it would be only the lack of support for the phone as far as good accessories goes, but i am sure that problem will get fixed once the phone is out on the market for a while.
While I like the Fire better than my iPhone, I can't just fully cut over because too many Apps are missing from the Fire.  For example, who can live without Uber?  And my bank Apps are not on Fire:  Regions, Citi, and Bank of the Internet are all missing.  Google Docs and Drive are also missing without going thru a third party app, which would expose my Google password to a 3rd party.  The Fire is too good to return, but these missing apps better show up soon.
I haven't read any of the reviews yet, but I wanted to leave one. I'm not one for writing reviews.<br/><br/>First, let me say that I am a loyal Amazon and Kindle customer. Iove the prime shopping and prime entertainment. It is perfect for my life style in today's technological times. I not only have the world at my fingertips but I can get free shipping and endless entertainment.<br/><br/>I didn't know Amazon was going to have a cellphone until it was officially announced. I was so excited however my current phone was still in great condition and I didn't have any concerns about my wireless network. Let's face it... they all suck and are too expensive. I was so excited about the features of the Amazon phone. So, I was a sucker and pre-ordered the phone and switched network providers.<br/><br/>I received my new phone and was in awww of the screen and moving the phone around to see inside the photo.<br/><br/>The transfer of service took forever. I was making two cellphone payments because the network transfer was not completed correctly.<br/><br/>After these couple months of use i have decided that I do not like the contacts part. Saving and adding contacts is a weird. I don't know how to change from male to female silhouette per contacts. My daughter misses her picture on the screen. The speaker for phone calls is not loud enough. The Bluetooth connection doesn't start automatically every time. I miss my Windows phone to view work documents. (Well not really miss it... hahaha).<br/><br/>If you want a Kindle that can fit in your pocket and make phone calls than it is perfect.<br/><br/>I was disappointed when they drastically dropped the price of the phone to .99$. Wow. For the duped one's we should get another year of prime on top of the one with purchase for buying into the hype.<br/><br/>I will keep my Pocket Kindle Phone (copyright name... hahaha) only because it is a nice pocket sized kindle and I have all of mine and my daughter's entertainment on it.
My samsung galaxy s4 was dropped, then run over by a car at the airport, and I was suddenly in a situation where I needed a phone immediately.  I thought of my experiences with my kindles, my paperwhite, my fire, fire-hdx and how happy i've been with them beginning many years ago when I received the first kindle as a gift.  Aware that amazon had just released a new phone, I had a potential answer and did a cursory investigation. A friend of a friend told me about someone who had one they wanted to sell, which was only a day or two old-  That should have been a CLUE.  They were asking 450$, a lot as far as used phones are concerned, but much less than a new one or anything  comparable so I bought it.<br/><br/>IMPRESSIONS:  This is a great looking phone.  Its well made and has that same quality feel--similar to a kindle fire hdx, solid and well thought out.  That feeling when you hold something valuable or extremely well made, it requires no explanation-- you know its well made. The phone has nice features-- Rubber edges, glass front and back--making it very easy to hold in your hand.<br/><br/>I got it activated --yes, I had to go to AT&T; and port my number from my other carrier, and I thought, "What am I doing, this is ridiculous", but when  I made calls, the sound is WOW and I was hooked.  It sounds so good that I commented to many of the people I talked too, "wow you sound like you are so close", and they replied, "I know, I was going to say the same thing!"  So obviously the microphone and speakers are well made, well thought out, and work exceptionally well.  It seems so much better than anything anyone else has had experience with either  I was beginning to gloat, and tell others, "I have a new fire phone."  Many of my friends were excited and liked it as much as I did.<br/><br/>As I went to "customize" it, get all my photos, contacts, and change the wallpaper, I have some I like, but they have to be downloaded from "play"--no problem, but as I went to go to google play and couldn't find it, what was "no problem", suddenly became "big problem'  I tried to download it, but I couldn't find anywhere to download it from, as it usually comes pre-loaded but not on the Fire, why not? BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO USE APPSTORE.<br/><br/>So now after just one partial day, I discovered some very big differences from the routine android phone experience, many limitations, serious issues if you will about this phone and or the operating system.<br/><br/>DISLIKES<br/><br/>1- Apps have to come from app store---ok but limited, and many not available.<br/>2- Black glass front, Black glass back, difficult to clean fingerprints that seem to be all over it all the time.<br/>3- This glass is "Gorilla glass 3", which I learned with great frustration and surprise with my wifes i phone 4 (glass front/back) and a glass front/back on an old ipod, that glass of any kind, gorilla or not, breaks. Its slick, and therefore easy to drop.  Gorilla glass is interesting stuff.  Its chemically altered to be stronger, but its not bullet or break proof.  Its only stronger.  In phones, they have to use incredibly thin glass to make things work, which is double trouble and often times the glass breaks.  It will survive falls onto concrete from the roof without a scratch, then landing on carpet from the sofa it might break.  Its just so unpredictable as to what it can and cannot survive but it eventually will break given enough "accidents."<br/>4- About noon of day 2 after charging all night, the battery died.  My samsung would last all day easily, now I am back to my old Palm trio days, when I HAD to keep it plugged into the charger when not in use.<br/>5- I used to use on a daily almost constant basis:  GMAIL, google maps, and music ==now they are not available.<br/><br/>TO be fair, I did LIKE the following:<br/><br/>1- Its well made, and easy to hold.  Comfortable in pocket, no sharp edges or corners to "jab" you.<br/>2- sound---exceptional both speaking and hearing, even the "speakers", are very good.<br/>3- Amazon support and their software.  All my kindle stuff and preferences were all loaded automatically.<br/>4- Several (4) cameras in front screen for "3d"/ dynamic perspective, more to follow on this.<br/>5- Camera--13mp awesome.  Goodbye days of 3-5 mp cameras in phones.  The samsungs got us over the 10mp barrier and now it seems to be standard on high end phones.  Outstanding.<br/>6- 1080P video--takes 30 frames per second at 1080p.  Not outstanding, but darn good especially for a phone.  Not many years ago, you could not get that on a consumer camcorder.  Now, its hard to find a consumer camcorder, phones and digital cameras have eliminated or severely limited the market.<br/><br/>OPERATING SYSTEM:<br/>This is like the kindle fires which are ANDROID tablets--this is an android phone.  It has running ON TOP OF ANDROID, the Amazon FIRE Operating System.  This where we get some of the unique features and functions, and some of the lesser desired ones like no google apps on both this phone and the kindle Fire tablets.  The phone is not designed to run without FIRE.<br/><br/>This phone does have some very  interesting features, one -a button on the side called "firefly" and another is dynamic perspective.  This keeps an eye on your eyeball and adjusts what you are looking at to appear as 3D.  It does this by changing shadows, size, and shades of various colors.  Also, as you look at "Dynamic Perspective enabled" apps, it might pop up the menu or ask if you want to continue, etc., just as it would if you pressed the icon for the app.  Its supposed to (with the cameras in the front) gives you a "DYNAMIC PERSPECTIVE", their word for arificial 3d.  If you look at a map on the phone, its in what appears to be 3d, and some people report dizziness or nausea from using this.  I did not.  Its great for maps, but until there are apps for it, it will be a waste.<br/><br/>Firefly is a button on the front left that when pushed, launches a bar code reader and lets you scan just about anything and then gives you the price and availability at amazon.  I've compared prices and have bought a couple things from amazon using firefly.  Personally, I will have to use it a lot more to determine if this is an added bonus or a "gimmick".  Pre-Firefly,  I have either launched the amazon price checker -which does same thing, or amazon site--from phone browser or computer, or any of several different bar code apps.<br/><br/>LIke the fire-hdx there is a mayday button to get support with either the phone itself, (ie troubleshooting hardware/software) or with "how do I do this" kinds of questions.  They can remotely do just about anything on your phone if you get lost, stuck, or don't understand what they are telling you.  I know several people who love this feature on their tablet because they are able to install apps or find a pic or file they put on it, and now mayday can help find lost items, give demo's or explain misunderstandings.  Its a great feature.  I have not used it much, but I can see the value in it for less experienced users especially.<br/><br/>There is NO SD memory card slot.  So either --based on use---get the larger memory size, 32 or 64gig or plan on storing on the cloud.  You can store indefintely anything on amazon cloud FREE-and download it very easily.  However, if you want to have your music, videos, photos, etc, you will need the larger memory.  This is like firehdx or iphone/ipad.  No external storage.  Plan and buy accordingly, especially if you are in areas of sketchy wifi or slow speeds.  Its nice to have them with you.<br/><br/>RECOMMENDATIONS?<br/><br/>I do not recommend this phone for people who have had many generations of smart phones, or several years experience with a smart phone  WHY?==The big reasons are being limited to ATT only, the shorter than other phones battery life, app availability (or lack of) are the big deal killers for me.  Right after that is price.  It has a high initial cost, limited to using only The AT&T; network, and no sd slot.  I'm concerned about resale value.  An i-phone or any of the current samsung, nexus, LG, and a few others bring high resale.  This is an unknown but already there seems to be issues and lower prices from amazon.<br/><br/>HOWEVER ---if you are a first time phone user, or have limited experience with or never used a smartphone, then I would highly recommend this phone because of the mayday feature.  This would be a really great phone for someone who has limited experience or considers themselves "Tech illiterate".  The mayday feature provides a free tutor available 24x7 to assist you..<br/><br/>I hope this review helps.  As I learn more, gain more experience, or things change, "software updates etc", I will update the review.  YOu know, this is a nice phone.  The problem is, there are much better options for much less.  I would recommend a nexus, lg, samsung, or even iphone for same price which will have all the apps, great resale, and none of the above negatives.  Except for the dynamic perspective, firefly and mayday, this phone has nothing the others dont have, ---it really comes down to this: are those features worth enough to you to pay a premium price, have limitations with apps,  a phone with potential durability issues (glass), and its required you use now and forever the att network.<br/><br/>If those few things are worth it to you, then by all means.  For some they will be, especially as I mentioned, new users.  I hope this helps you to make a decision.  This is by no means a comprehensive and complete review.  That would take pages and pages.  This is designed to make you aware of the good and bad so you can decide if you want to consider this phone or not.  Good luck to you!
Sorry Amazon but when you use questionable build and part quality this is the kind of a device you end up with. First off locking the phone to only the amazon app store and totally screwing google and stonewalling them out of your device things aren't going to go well. Second of all the tactics of using AT&T; as a exclusive carrier in this day of age is down right dumb and frankly uncalled for. I knew what I was in for after reading the reviews but I thought maybe I would like it once I had the device in my hand(s).<br/><br/>Within seconds of powering on the device I was greeted with the Amazon logo then the Fire logo and noticed right away how bright the screen was ok well that's nice. Then I noticed how warm right after powering the device on it started to get. I get to the tutorials and I had to stop it because the phone started to make my fingers sweat and the glass on the back became more slippery, Not a good sign. I get to the lock screen and thought eh that's neat but instantly lost it's luster and realized how gimmicky it was. So unlocking the phone there was some lag to it then I see all my apps, books and anything else that was on the cloud was on the carousel, I went straight to the settings turned the display down all the way, clicked auto-brightness off and notifications off. Phone was still noticeably bright with dim all the way down. I did the update even though it failed twice to install finally got it the third time and let it restart and still the phone was really warm almost hot. Phone would take a couple of seconds for the lock screen to show up and then a second or two for the main menu to show up, Lots of lag not very impressive. Side panels would pop open if you accidently tilted the phone, auto scroll would go flying if you moved the phone on the web, speaker quality was terrible, email program was very similar to the iMail on the iPhone which was a instant turn off. Finally, if you removed everything from the carousel you had to tap the home button then you could scroll down to the app panel, again not very impressive or intuitive. All this was conceived in a hour of playing with the phone there was no way I was going to be happy with this phone and I knew it was going to be sent back and sent back it was this morning. Sorry Amazon nice try but next time don't lock it to just your app store and AT&T.; Also might want to rethink the whole design and get rid of the "dynamic perspective" and please don't copy the kindle fire menu/carousel for your next phone (if you do a next phone).
It's great so easy to use
I got the fire phone on launch day, had to have it replaced a week late due to a faulty usb port. I've had no issues with the second phone as far as hardware goes. The phone had a pleasing feel in the hands. I live the overall design of the phone. However, the phone lacks features and function. The lack of apps is astounding, no Google apps is a serious letdown. Installed apps give compatibility errors upon update. Battery life is atrocious. Phone overheats regularly, often times leading to freezing up and/or shutting off. The screen is a not sensitive to the touch requiring multiple touches to get any response. There are so many other issues with the phone that I Ann going to stop there to save myself some time. The phone needed a lot of work before being released, yet it was released anyway. I'm so close to being able to replace this phone and I am dying to do so. If I could give the phone a rating of less than one star I would do so. Don't give up Amazon, hardware wise phone was decent... just make an android phone...
I really enjoy this phone. While it only has 3.2 megapixel camera, it still has 720p HD screen and the dynamic view function allows for some really cool things to be created for it than no other phone has yet!
Great
Great
I jump on every trend Amazon peddles my way. When prime was new, I got it the first month. 1st Generation Kindle, bought it. Paperwhite, done. Fire stick, YES! When the Fire Phone was announced, I bought day one. I love Amazon, so why do they abuse me with this phone. I was so excited to have all my content  on my phone. A direct link to all my books, audio books, music, and movies. Yes! But then I got the phone what a piece of junk this phone is. If it lived up to half the promises it made I would still be thrilled but it just does not.<br/>Other people have commented on the apps and app store (or lack there of) so I wont but if you plan on using your phone for more than phone calls and texting, go a different route. Even apps they offer like Uber will not work.<br/>One of the best features I thought was Mayday. Sure you get someone on the line in less than a minute but then they transfer you and transfer you and transfer you. All the while everyone wants you to shut off the phone, restart, then deactivate (which by the way losses all your passwords) and then activate again. Go clear your cache and NO none of that will work so we transfer you again and again. If you have the fire phone and tried to download something you know exactly what I am talking about.<br/>The phone is so buggy. I turned on the phone this morning to find all my audio books, save one, have been removed from the phone. Still in the cloud so I download them all again. The phone wont work sometimes, just refuses to respond, The other day, I could not make a call out.<br/>I was a fool. I debated between this phone and the iPhone 6. I should have gone with Apple.
This phone is quite simply terrible. Marketed as a media phone it is unable to properly play media with choppy video, errors, inability to start and pause video. Even near a tower it's reception is horrible and I have had far too many dropped and missed calls. But the truly negligent thing is the battery life. I can have it fully charged but it will run out before the end of the work day with little use. If you try to play games or stream media it drops like a rock and even plugged in it will discharge. And what is worse is if it goes below 14% it will often continuously pop-up the charge warning screen if you plug it in which will discharge and kill the phone quickly . Amazon fixed a few unforgivable oversights with a recent update, like lack of special characters, but there are still too many problems that puts this phone back 5 years. It cannot function as a media phone and it can't even be a proper phone. Avoid this phone, I wish I had, or swapped it within the trial period.
The Fire could be MUCH better.I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage. Amazon’s cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.
Solid phone. Fast, easy, and and compact.
I have read recent articles on the slumping sale of the Fire phone. Frankly, I do not understand why. I am completely happy with its features. Incredible camera, and all the cool apps I could wish for.
I actually got this phone the day it came out. I was excited about some of the features but have found the overall user experience to be awkward and the app store to be extremely lacking.<br/><br/>Also as a loyal Amazon customer I feel like I have been spit on to be honest. I get this phone on day 1 for 200 bucks out of pocket and 6 weeks later it is 1 dollar?? Maybe throw the few people who bought the phone at 200 dollars a bone and give an additional year of prime or something! Very frustrating over all, I guess I just feel cheated.
I gave it three stars because I have a google play account where I can listen to unlimited music and I can't use it on this phone why should I have to buy music when I pay for unlimited music access
Some of the features such as the flick to change menus does not always work very well.  The lack of apps and long war for some of the most popular would make me switch phones when my contract is up
Haven't had any problems with this phone I have had it for about a month now the battery life is still very good I have signal every where I have been it's just pretty much a good phone all around
Great. More than what I was expecting...
No its a terrible phone
I enjoy the phone a lot
I have been very pleased with the phone
Just received it. STILL figuring it out. Mayday feature is AWESOME!! Still overall I'm happy with my purchase
I am appalled by the fact that  the unlimited photo storage in the cloud feature is powered by dirty energy. Unlike Apple and Google who have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s data centers are powered by crap like coal and gas. Amazon, it's time to join the 21st century where your energy use is concerned - do the right thing and go green. Until you do, I won't be buying this phone.
I don't like that there are a limited amount of cases for this phone. Also I don't like that I am unable to install snapchat. And I think the space bar on the keyboard should be longer.
Great phone fun to use. Easy to handle
Need at add Group Me to the app store.
This is the best cell phone I have had yet.  EasY to use and especially THE MAYDAY feature.  I don't have to go to the ATT store to ask questions about the operation, just call Mayday.
Doesn't respond well - have to tap most icons at least twice for a response and the side swipe menu is a pain to actually get to open up.  It seems like a little thing but when your phone doesnt respond to you hundreds of times a day, it gets incredibly frustrating.  The firefly is the main reason I switched to this phone and boy, what a disappointment - it hasn't identified objects or phone numbers about 80% of the time I've tried it.  It either doesnt recognise the numbers/item or it takes SOOOOO long that it makes the ability to be able to firefly something useless.  A plus is the mayday button which I've used to try to address some of the response issues but these are things that the tech guy on the phone can't fix.  The Mayday people are, however, incredibly kind and helpful and I think the mayday button option is the main reason I haven't returned the phone....yet.
I was naively thinking this phone would give me an iPone quality cam for $130. It took me less than a day to see the camera is really bad indoors. I took a few selfies indoors on a cloudy morning with the back camera - no artificial light and no flash. Selfies instantly tell if the camera is sharp, you just have to observe your eyelashes and skin pores. Unfortunately all of the selfies looked unfocused with smeared noisy details. The optical stabilization definitely wasn't doing a good job reducing the camera shake, nor is the fact that there is no timer option. The Fire phone takes 3 pics in low light and lets you choose the sharpest, but none was good. To be fair, iPhone 5s also has problems getting a sharp pic in such light but it takes 10 pics and half of the time gets a sharp one, without any optical stabilization. In the same conditions my Alcatel Idol 3 produces sharp selfies most of the time in its manual mode - ISO 800 and 5s timer. The Fire Phone also had problem with the color balance in artificial light. In the evening, under energy saving light bulbs it overemphasized the yellow cast to extreme.<br/><br/>The camera looks good on specs but the software controlling it seems rather dumb and cannot even begin to compare to the iPhone cams although it copied their simplistic interface without a lot of options. I find it rather strange that so many reviewers claim that the camera is good when it took me one morning to realize it simply won't work indoors in low light. The OS was up to date so that wasn't the problem.
The better phone that l have ever had
Very happy with my Amazon Fire Phone!
The more I use it the more I like it.
Great hardware, lacked support for popular apps. Bluetooth was horrible. Battery life was incredible. Returned mine within 10 days. Lack of Google apps is what made me give it up.
I love this phone!!!!
I like the phone, I wish it had more apps available. Switching from the iPhone I am missing a lot of the apps I am used to and need for work. Such as paypal here and my bank apps
I didn't care for the Kindle Fire Phone because it didn't have several features such as wallpaper, Facetime and a couple of other items.  Plus the data charges were really high.
Being a little older i had some trouble first navigating this electronic wonder.<br/>I'm sure it will even do more than I have been able to navigate so far.<br/>It amazing !!!
Good phone, easy to use, excellent display, broad functionality.  Too heavy, and disheartening wrangles with ATT (seller and service provider) overcpntract and unwanted add-ons.
Love my new phone! Am amazed and surprised at its abilities! Picture is so clear, great 3-D fx, is super fast, and functional. Superb sound. Still learning all it has to offer.
I love the phone - the size, the graphics, the ease of settings.  Unfortunately, I took the phone back today.  I am so dependent on some productivity apps that are not available on this phone.  The personnel at the AT&T; store said I could use Galaxy apps which have an open policy but it seems like this is just asking for problems for a non-techno user.  Once apps such as FitBit, One Note, certain banks, Canvas, Starbucks are available, I will get another Fire Phone with pleasure.
Have to manually turn off data access when not in range of a signal. Device constantly searches for a signal thereby racking up data usage.No visual alert for call or message.
It’s time to put out the Fire! It makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud is not a strong selling point, especially when competitors like Apple are using 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon can commit to using modern energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.
Amazon needs more apps like snapchat
I like it,was not hard to understand
Amazing phone with Jake just how bio
Let me first preface, I had an iPhone and a samsung galaxy. I am very familiar with iTunes and Google play. I am also an avid amazon kindle user. My family owns four. We love amazon produces.  So when a phone comes out it seems natural. The problem I HATE AT&T.;  In my area the reception is bad, and data rates are high. However, get this buy the phone outright and unlock it. You can use it on straight talk. $45. A month uses AT&T; towers and Version towers in my rural area. Yes the reviews are truethere are some apps iI might not be able to use. So I will have to go to the Hobby Lobby website for the coupon. I can listen to my prime music and read!!! The camera is amazingly clear. Navigation is easy. The recent update fixed a bunch of quirks cause I just don't see them here now. LOVE this phone. Have I mentioned the memory. Wow.
Good phone but the app store needs expanding, would be nice if the phone could be more personalized and choice of web browser would be nice. Other wise it's a great phone.
Only thing that bothered me was the back button feature also can't get some of my old Google apps
The Fire Phone is an awesome phone. For a 1st smart phone for someone, it is the only one to get. Easy to use, great support, awesome features and holds charge very well.
I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.
Great phone just battery life sucks
I would say "Best Phone" . Think about Google first phone. Don't know why people giving one star to this phone. I would say this is game change in Smart phone industry. I am so happy with this phone. Apps & phone screen is super crisp than any phone in the market. Love the dynamic perspective & firefly feature. I understand that store doesn't have Netflix & YouTube but both are coming in next upgrade & next upgrade will fix so many glitches.
Why the Fire is really a misfire. I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.
I wanted to love this phone. It is Amazon and I love all things Amazon but this is a complete let down. I cannot block calls. The singular home button is frustrating. The appstore is so small that I find myself having to use third party sources to find all the popular apps I had installed on my android. The speakers do not have a good volume. The design does not allow you to place your phone on a surface and amplify the sound.<br/><br/>The camera is great. I have kept this phone because I am an Amazon fanatic. I purchase things all the time and love having it in the palm of my hand. The way it interacts with my fire tv is also a plus.<br/><br/>I hate to give it so few stars but I liken this phone to a Firefly Phone, Its simplicity as a phone and what it can do is really child's play.
😊😊
Best
It's a good phone thank you Angela
This is an amazing phone. Looked at all comparable devices and this is the best. The year of prime is an added bonus,this just can not be beat. Great Job AMAZON!!!
I have had some minor difficulties with the phone, but after receiving my replacement phone I haven't had anymore problems and I absolutely love this phone.
Amazon is apparently committed to maximizing its profits at the expense of the future of our planet and our children. They need to follow the lead of other big data companies and commit to running their data centers--on which the potential success of this phone depends--on renewable energy sources. It is a truly despicable display of greed that Amazon has resisted this. They are clearly in the wrong morally--and this is going to catch up with them and start to hurt their bottomline. Amazon may be arrogant enough to believe that whatever they do, nothing bad can happen to their business but this is obviously a huge mistake in the long run.<br/><br/>Fortunately, this phone seems to be a piece of junk from a user perspective anyhow.<br/><br/>We can only hope that Amazon will choose to use their economic might to improve the world by making a huge commitment to supporting renewable energy rather than to poison our present and future by accelerating the burning of fossil fuels.
I had my phone for about a month now.I'm still learning it but I'm in love with it.It takes amazing pictures of my daughter.So far so good no complaints.
I love my fire phone... Upgrade from iPhone 5 and I won't be going back anytime soon!<br/><br/>Update 9/22:  I loved my fire phone.  However, AT&T; is horrible and I had to return it.  They added 25 dollars to my bill per month for upgrading to this.  They never told me about this apparently new policy.  Beware.  I am now switching services because of this.  Hopefully, the fire phone will come to other carriers.
Does everything I want and more. Just have trouble erasing unwanted items. Most problems are caused by me . Cranial flatulence runs repent in my family.
Let me start by saying, this is not a forum to Tell us how you hate AT&T;!  Review the phone on this, not the carrier!  Use your not so common sense people!
Where to begin. The battery life is garbage even on the lowest dim. When charging the apps are fumbly at best. Home key sticks a lot. When the phone gets hot it will randomly send your pics and crazy text to random people. You can get the apps by back loading Google play but it's tedious. I would only recommend this phone to my ex wife in hopes that it would prevent her from ever calling me again.
Very please with my cell phone.
Very happy! Very user friendly!
The phone needs a great deal of work. There is not the ease of use as there is with other phones, both iOS and Android based. Amazon is attempting to grow another market but falls short in many areas with this phone.
I love this phone
I was so excited to get this phone, but it has been nothing but a huge letdown. A few features, namely the camera, are great. Exactly what I was looking for! If only that were enough. I could write a book about all of the bugs I'm dealing with. It runs too hot to touch when plugged in, freezes for no reason, the calendar shows the wrong date, it won't remember my wi-fi password and/or kicks me off wifi for no reason, even sometimes turns itself to airplane mode! For no reason! I could overlook all the apps I can't get or that don't work properly, but with all these other issues the phone is practically unusable. I have to restart the phone almost once a day just to use it!  Amazon has replaced the phone twice, but so far I keep having the same issues with new phones. Unfortunately, I bought it through AT&T; because of my contract, so they won't touch it and refer me to Amazon, who can only keep sending me replacements, they won't refund it. So I'm stuck with this mess for two years! Super sad face...
Excellent device, with a great performance and awesome apps. Great phone in an excellent price! Thanks amazon for making me betrayed the iPhone!
Over all it is ok. Cannot get a lot of apps. The screen will freeze from time to time. But the Prime subscription is awesome. Low battery life.
Great phone and easy to use!!!
I love this phone, there is a few things like certain apps I can't get & I do wish it had a back button, but other than than it is awesome. :)
This is a perfectly nice phone.  The main weakness is a shortage of good apps.  The variety of Apps I had hoped for are simply not available.
I am very disappointed in the Fire Phone. Our family is a heavy Amazon user, and I love the Kindle and the Kindle Fire, so I had high expectations of the Fire Phone. I was using an iPhone 4 and because I love Amazon so much, I decided to go with the Fire Phone instead of the iPhone 6, and honestly, after having the Fire Phone for a week I wish I would have gone with the iPhone 6.<br/><br/>My issues: Battery life is almost non-existent, I used to have to recharge my old iPhone 4 every other day. With the Fire Phone I can use it maybe 6 hours before it needs recharging. I stole the external battery from my husband's Raspberry Pi just so I can get through a full day of running errands. And I'm not using the phone any different than I used my iPhone - I read on the kindle ap while I'm waiting in line, I check my Facebook and my Twitter, and I may play a little Plants vs. Zombies if I get really bored.<br/><br/>But battery life is not the deal breaker with this phone, the deal breaker is that my favorite aps aren't available. I wanted to order pizza for dinner, the Dominos ap doesn't work. I wanted to order movie tickets, Amazon doesn't have an ap for that. I wanted to transfer some money from my savings account to my checking, and my bank, my large international bank, does not have an Ap for the Fire Phone. Not to mention that the Facebook ap intermittently won't open, often crashes, and for some reason if I look at a picture, any picture, the ap freezes and I have to manually remove it from the phones memory and restart it.<br/><br/>I am still carrying around my iPhone 4 without a service so I can still do stuff like bank, order pizza, and browse Facebook when I'm on my lunch break at work. (I attach the iPhone to my home or work WiFi.) My husband jokes that my iPhone has become a micro-iPad.<br/><br/>I gave the Fire Phone two stars because I can send and receive phone calls on it and it does have a camera.<br/><br/>Phones should not be this frustrating to use.
I thought by now there would be more apps available and some of the "early launch" pieces would be handled.  I feel like I adopted early and have been punished.  The phone itself works fine.  Functionally-  it is a good phone with a nice camera and a speedy engine.  Those things are great.  However, a lack of apps and some funtionality transfer between different apps make this a bit of a drag.  I can make due with it....<br/>IF ONLY i could get apps for this phone from somewhere other than the Amazon app store- like the google play store.  Its working off ANDROID platform, so I should be able to do this, right?  Any advice here would be appreciated.
First of all, let me say that I almost did not buy this phone because I listened to all of the reviews that called the phone 'junk' 'a joke' etc...But I bought one anyway and I am glad I did. The Fire phone is a solid, very well built phone. The screen resolution, while on paper is not equal to some of the flagship phones is very good and virtually indistinquishable from the 'top of the line' phones. The camera is second to none. The app store has every application that I need, my bank, Facebook so I can keep in touch with my daughter and weather. I am at an age where I don't need to fill my phone with useless apps. I went from a Samsung Galaxy s III to a Fire phone, and honestly the Google app store is about 90% useless junk in my opinion and 10% relevent content. If you are younger and need to follow everyone and purchase the latest and greatest flagship phone, the Fire phone is not for you. If you can go your own way, then the fire may be for you. I see a lot of comparisons with the fire phone to Galaxy s5, Lg G3 and iphone. These comaprisons are not relevent because I don't believe the Fire was made to compete with the 'flagship' phones of the top 4 or 5 compaies, because it is not like these other phones and in fact is not like any phone on the market which makes it perfect for me because I don't follow the crowd and do not buy a certain phone just because everyone else has it. The Firefly is a good feature but using the Fire as an Amazon interface is not it's only virtue as it is a fine phone in it's own right. I don't understand the dislike and in fact hatred that I see on some of the reviews of this phone, many times from people who have not even so much as touched it. There is a lot of anger directed at  this phone which tells me that Amazon is doing something right. If you are secure enough to go through your day with a phone that does not have an apple on the back or the name of the top 3 or 4 phone makers on it, then this phone may be for you.
Like it but I'm still not happy with the lack of apps like dish anywhere! I feel like I got on i-phone. Oh yea they do have dish anywhere.
It takes a little while to get used to the operating system, and the sound system isn't the best, but overall I'm satisfied with the Fire.
I completely love my phone. I don't understand the negativity and quite honestly a lot of these reviews, -and not just for this product but most anything that is being reviewed- get in to being so critical about every knit picking thing. To each there own and I respect the difference of opinion. That being said I have no complaints. That is saying something.
works great plenty of aps too
I absolutely love this phone!
I have been a iPhone user from the day they came out.  So when it came time to upgrade I decided on the Amazon Fire.  I LOVE IT!<br/>The Mayday feature is a big plus.  I was also able to convert my iTunes music to Cloud and download from there to my phone.  Being able to "talk" your text and email is also really neat.  Thank you Amazon!
Didn't Light My Fire ... I think it’s completely unnecessary that many of the Fire's key features, like unlimited cloud photo storage, are supported by Amazon's data centers that are powered by coal and other dirty energy. If Amazon matched competitors like Apple by powering their operations with clean and renewable energy, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.
Great phone just not android
There are times when the home button is pressed to get to the unlock screen that it just blinks and the unlock screen won't come up.
Does everything I wanted it to do and does it well.  If you are a Kindle Fire user you will find the Fire Phone an easy transition.
So my husband pre-ordered the phone for me and as an Amazon addict I knew that I would probably like it, but I wasn't sure I wanted to give up my Galaxy S4. When the phone got here I instantly fell in love with it. As a person that is integrated with Google I was worried about getting my contacts and all my photos moved in but it just automatically liked with my email and pulled them all in. I was in shock. This is one of the easiest phones I have ever had. There is no issues in switching like there was when I switched from an iPhone to a Galaxy. Everything has worked flawless. I have to say though that I was starting to get irritated at the fact that I couldn't get my ringtones to pull it. Its not like regular androids where you can move files around, but once I figured it out I was fine. I'm still having an issue getting a notification sound to be set as default for my texts (for some reason it works for other apps but not messaging) but I'm sure I'll figure it out soon. My only main thing was the apps.... I know that Amazon is currently working on the store to grow as it has recently added Instagram before the phone launched, but I am missing my Starbucks app. I use it to pay so when I found out they did not have it I was really disappointed. Hopefully soon they will get it because I have a slight addiction to it but I am being positive about it. Overall I think the phone is great and works so easily with everything. As a Kindle user I had a feeling I would love it and I was right. So to anyone unsure if you like the Kindle, you will really love the phone.
Worse phone I've ever had. If you are on WiFi and want to watch a movie through Amazon prime. It works great. That's the only good thing. If you need your phone to make calls like I do. It's a bad choice. It's drops calls like a hot rock. I couldn't get most apps either or I couldn't get most of the ones I could get to work right like my banking or credit card apps. The music I purchased on the phone and " downloaded" to it wounldnt play unless you have an internet connection. I've actually gone through two of these phones in about 8 months. Finally went and bought an iPhone and problem solved.
love the phone. if you enjoy your kindle you will enjoy this. the only downfall is all the apps you are used to aren't there yet<br/><br/>I will say we do love amazon. We shop here at least monthly. They give us products we use daily and make our life simple. however, I am not happy with the price drop right after we went to att and got a new  phone line. I still give the phone a five and love the prime.
Hard To Get Back And Forth.
Great phone and easy to use
Absolutely love this phone!
I love my new fire phone!!!
The good, the bad, the ugly!  OK the phone is not ugly and the dynamic perspective is well done.  The BAD...Amazon charged $199  for the phone ( I bought 2, one for my wife) and now yesterday 3 months later the same phone with 2 year plan is 99 cents.  So a loyal customer of many years just got the shaft!  I feel betrayed by the company (and I am a stockholder).  The lesson must be.....TRUST....In an interview this morning the CEO of Alibaba said that trust of his customers and partners was his major thrust in achieving the success of the company.  Amazon and Jeff Bezos have lost my trust.
Love it!
The most complete phone in the market,if you are ture if android market and itunes this is where you got to go,amazing phone.
I am very happy with this new Amazon phone.  Calls are crystal clear and there are all kinds of new innovations, including Firefly for identifing movies, books, etc., and the tilt/swivel options.  Yes, being from Amazon, it is geered towards shopping/purcahses, but not a deterant from owning this very special phone.
Was real excited to finally get my hands on this phone and am not real happy that the battery runs out before the day is over.  You cannot stay on it much throughout the day without just draining the battery.  I am typing this at 4:45 and plugged it in at 4:30 with only 22% battery life left, and I got up at 9 this morning.  I have only used it for about 75% of the day today.  Not sure if I am going to take it back and get another Samsung phone like the S5, at least I still have 12 days to make up my mind.  Never had this problem with my two previous Galaxy Note 2 & Note 3.
LOVE LOVE LOVE my FIRE!!! It is everything I wanted and much much more. Best cell I have ever had! Thanks Amazon and AT&T;!
I love the amazon fire phone and all of its features. I will never choose nothing but this phone. There's nothing like it.
A good phone from Amazon !
Yay
I love Amazon... but I also love Apple. I've been an iPhone user for many years.  It was a tough decision to switch, but the huge amount of storage on this phone, combined with the other features swayed me.<br/><br/>Things I love about this phone:<br/><br/>- Unlimited cloud photo storage<br/>- Huge amount of storage space<br/>- Firefly (easily ID's movies and shows... product ID not always as great)<br/>- Dynamic perspective (it's pretty cool with lots of potential for developers to take advantage of it)<br/>- I like the tilting/sidepanel features<br/>- The size is great<br/><br/>Things that aren't so great:<br/><br/>- Battery life is not great...but not as bad as others have reported here<br/>- Missing some apps I love, but there are others that make up for it<br/>- This is Apple's fault, but it's a HUGE pain that I couldn't get messages from iPhone users at first (after switching from an iPhone). It's super annoying and still not totally fixed. Most of my friends and family have iPhones so this is a big deal. Apple's sneaky way of trying to keep people on their system, I think.<br/><br/>I also wish the "auto scroll" feature worked on Kindle books.<br/><br/>I think Amazon will probably come out with system updates that help with some of the issues, so I remain hopeful.<br/><br/>Overall, a great buy for those who love Amazon. The free year of Prime and 1,000 coins certainly didn't hurt!
Beyond Amazing
Love the fire!
I didn't expect this to be perfect, its brand new to the market and the first of its kind.  The first iphone wasn't perfect and now people cant get enough of iphone.  This needs a few software updates and probably needs a place to put recommendations for improvements.  In the long run i love this phone.
Amazing phone, great alternative to the iPhone. Fast, awesome screen clarity, easy to use functions. Perfect fit for me.
a no brainer if your already an amazon prime member..... took a minute to switch my old number from Verizon to att but they worked it out. the web voice search is pretty accurate i'm happy with my purchase of 2 with my those 2 free years of prime!!  the phones were practically free with a new contract.
I'm very pleased with the phone and the 1 year of Amazon Prime, but I'm not liking not having any of my Android apps.
I love this phone it is user friendly and meets or exceeds all my expectations on battery life based on how I use it.
nice phone, cool features
Awesome I  really like it
Very good phone I love it
Bought this phone for my son. He loves it!! He says its better than the lg g3. He really likes the 5 front cameras.
Lots of good features. Still learning it, but miss some of the user friendly functionality of my old Windows phone.
I'm really excited about my new Amazon Fire Phone!  I still am learning all it can do, and enjoying the learning!
I'm really glad I got this phone. I was gonna pick a different one for my upgrade, so glad I didn't. I got a deal of 299. with my upgrade and contract was up. The only thing I'm running into right now for problems.. is the battery life goes to fast. I thought it was from staying up the apps and stuff. Today I have not and battery still dies fast. Charging is slow too. Had on the charger all night about 7hours and still was only it 96%. I don't leave apps running or open. If they fix that this phone would be great.
Best phone I've had yet!
LOL! I'm about to buy this phone but the price went double. I thought Amazon is planning to just give it away.
It got a virus 2nd day I had it.It will not hold my memory card.Really don't like the holder for the Sim card.
I love the phone... I have had Android and iPhone always looking for something like this phone.. it is unique
There are things that this phone has that are great!  But, the bad ones are bad!<br/>I can't download games from my iphone to the fire phobe<br/>The camera button is too easy to hit when picking up the device<br/>Cannot choose font<br/>I need more cool wallpapers of the same type as is offered already (I especially like the Easter Island type!)<br/>I can't easily find some of the great qualities<br/>I need a guide that's not just an overview!<br/>When looking in the app store, if I look at one specific app, I don't go back to my place in the list but back to the top<br/><br/>There are many things that I really like about the phone too!<br/>I don't have to sit and wait a long time when the phone is too slow<br/>The "peeking" is really neat<br/>The camera seems to be better so far<br/>The two extra screens are very helpful!<br/><br/>There are a lot more things that I like that I won't take time to list!
I like the phone. I've pretty much figured out most of it on my own just by trial and error. There are some issues though. #1 the app store seems geared way more toward the kindle and there's so much you can't do without Google play which still is not available (it drives me crazy I can't see my friends emotions in text & I can't send them without a completely separate app) and that's just an example. #2 certain things are just missing... You have to use one of the automatic tones for the alarm, ringtone, everything unless you get a separate app that you have to pay for. And the screen freezes, pretty often too, so you'll be in the middle of a text and it'll still type it but you can't see what you are typing anymore without restarting the phone. I like this phone, don't get me wrong, but some updates would be greatly appreciated. I could do so much more on my iPhone. But I really really want this one to be better!
Love it ~ awesome phone
I like the phone because you can view your Kindle, movies, hear music and talk on this phone! I love it!,
Got this 64gb fire phone because I am a big Amazon person! I have spent so much money on Amazon it unreal! So I spent even more and bought this fire phone and silent even more to get 64gb! What a waste of money for me! No-one of the apps I like are here and I can't do any of my online banking for my two banks on it! Even PayPal stops working! Don't buy one before doing a lot of checking to see if it is right for you! I have a new one I'll sell for $175 free shipping!
This is a great phone.
The phone interface takes a little getting used to but is easy to use once you familiarize yourself with it.  The app store was the big let down on this.  Amazon app store lacks A LOT of the apps available on the Google play store. They should allow you the opportunity to download these apps via google play store.  Camera and sound are great. Free amazon prime is awesome. IN THE END IT ALL COMES BACK TO THE LACK OF APPS AVAILABLE THROUGH THE AMAZON APP STORE.
Awesome features! Just gets really hot and all the cameras/"sensors" are weird. Other than that it's great. Easy to use.
The only thing I like about this phone is the ease of dropping and dragging files (music, vidoes, pictures....) other than that its just plain terrible.  I miss my iphone apps.  It will not full screen on youtube and of course will not work with chromecast.  Its very bulky once you put a case on it.  The volume randomly stops working and requires several power off through the day.  Sorry Amazon...wish there was a good cross between this and an iphone...
I was looking forward to a great phone by amazon given my liking for amazon. The phone freezes suddenly and takes a long time to open the maps at times when i really need it to act fast. However I should say maps on the amazon fire are good and personally like it. I wish the phone's performance was equally good to make the overall experience a great one. I was one of the first adopters and paid more and realized i should have waited in the first place.
This phone is awesome. It is easy to use, synching it with the music on my amazon cloud was great.
Cloud storage should run in 100% renewable energy. Please, if you are indeed the most costumer centered company in the world, you would care about life of your current and future costumers. Go green!
I have the att fire phone I gotten off of eBay for 113.00 but I really don't see what peoples are talking about if you don't want to use att used cricket and if you need Gmail etc just download it off the internet peoples giving this phone a bad reviews cause it's not Android but when did Amazon kindle ever had Google play all knew what you was getting yourself into don't rate the phone not having Google app rate it for how well it perform
I'm happy with it....
Just a superb device!
This phone is amazing
I love this cellphone
Better than I spected
I recently transitioned from the iPhone to the Amazon Fire Phone. This phone is perfect for me. I do a lot of shopping on Amazon and getting Prime for free is awesome. This phone is simple to use and has excellent features. My wife now wants the Fire. Thank you Amazon for creating this phone
Looking at the specs I expected more. The home screen is awful so you have to load another launcher to navigate it. IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH GOOGLE PRODUCTS. Only by sideloading, adding more programs etc can I have google maps (not my account though as you cant sign in) and chrome. All of my music is in google play that I cannot access. app store is awful, response is delayed. Currently amazon music wont even open. Biggest POS ive ever used. Storing #s you have to manually type them in from callers in your call log. I learned my lesson though, if it seems too good to be true, it is. I looked to try to 'trade in' on amazon but shockingly there is no option lile there is with any other good phone? I guess they know its crap but think its shameful they wont let you get rid of it for a phone that works and has the apps you need.
Can't get all the apps I was used to with my IPhone, but love other features. Very easy to use.
The phone is nice looking and feels great in your hand. Going from an iPhone to this was a little bit tricky but I'm sure that I'll be able to get used to it.<br/>My main issue is that texting is not reliable on this phone. The key pad is too erratic and the auto correct is completely on a rampage.<br/>I could go on and on and on about it, but I just rather say that I'm taking it back today for something else or my money back
I switched to this phone after having an iPhone 4.  I was very surprised that most of the apps that I use on a daily basis are available for the fire phone.  The only app that I was not able to find is my credit union.  I have been using the phone for 4 days now and I am still finding new ways to get to the features and settings that I want.  I have not noticed a problem with battery life it stays charged for a full day.  I would imagine this would be more of an issue if you spend a lot of time streaming movies.  Overall I would recommend purchasing this phone to friends and family.  The only major issue that I had was not receiving messages from iPhone users but I was able to get this resolved quickly after AT&T; put me in touch with Apple customer service.  I really was afraid that I would not like the phone since I purchased it without being able to see it or demo it first but I am extremely pleased with the quality and features.  I can't wait to see what the future will bring for this phone and it's apps.
I have a wonderful fire phone that I have used for a few weeks now. It brings me a lot of Joy. It has an unlimited capacity for doing quality work. It's the best business smartphone I have ever owned.<br/>I strongly recommend this phone for serious business-people and scholars.
I gave the phone to my daughter so I can't say much about it except she seems happy with it.
stuck with it though
Have had the phone 24 hours and it's locked up.  Screen is on, but it won't do anything.  "Back" button and 'On/Off' switch doesn't work either.  Was looking on the website for a 24/7 contact info since I can't call up May Day on the phone.  Not a happy camper.
Love this phone wish it had more banking apps and apps that people use for household bill s
fantastic phone, lots of gizmos on it. i love the mayday option because i really need it.
I really think that this a great phone, I just love it still learning how to operate it..
I love the Fire so much I ordered one for my son ... arrived today.  Yeah!  Fire is HOT!
This phone has some really cool features, but it sometimes feels like they rushed the release of this and didn't finish working out a lot of bugs. There are a lot of apps this device just doesn't have. They say they put out new apps everyday, and I believe they are working hard to make the apps I want, I just wish they had worked on getting more of these apps out before releasing the phone.<br/>The camera works very well, and offers all the things we have come to expect from a smart phone camera. Fast/burst pictures, filters and effects. Its good. Firefly is a cool feature but isn't something I actually use often. Over all it is a cool phone, but it could be a lot better, but I think it will only get better, especially if they release a version 2 of the phone.
Love it!!!
Awesome!! I love it
It's a great phone.
Thus far I have enjoyed this phone very much, still have not utilized all its features
A great product! Fun and easy to use. Two thumbs up! Ten out of ten, would bye again.
I really wanted to like this phone but after almost 2 months of trying, I have given up. First problem occurred with the backup which really does not back up anything. After I was assured that everything would be backed up by the MayDay person, I was disappointed to have to re-install everything and even re-enter all my settings. Second problem was the integration with Google which it has almost none, which means even chromecast would not operate. I felt as though I was being forced into buying nothing but Amazon products which is why I refuse to own anything Apple. Next problem occurred when I connected a bluetooth headset, although I could hear everything fine, everyone complained that my voice was breaking up or I sounded like I was in a tunnel. I went through 4 different headsets with the same results on all 4. I again contacted Mayday who put in a trouble ticket and said I would hear back in a few days. That was over 2 weeks ago. I am now having problems with the phone connecting to my home network. Mayday folks insist it is my home router even though I have 2 wireless routers in my home and over 8 other pieces of equipment working perfectly with the network. They refuse to admit it is the phone. I have learned the whole Mayday app is great if you just want to find out how to do basic things in less then a minute, but any real problems with the phone, you would be better off figuring it out yourself, that is what they do anyways . On the bright side, the 3d effect is really cool and the screen is great but the number of things you can do with the 3d is extremely limited and once the novelty wears off, you are left with a very basic iphone with with a whole less options and discontinued tech support.
I may very well increase my stars as I get used to the phone.  I've only had it a couple of weeks, and so far I like it a great deal.  it has been relatively easy for a non-techy person such as me to set up.  I am still struggling to figure out a few aps.  I can appreciate the sleek packaging, but I do wish it came with a small manual to refer to.  I like to read and do ... and that way I learn.  And I am not ALWAYS near a computer where I can do the 'online manual'.  Thankfully if I get to the point where I 'Just Can't Get It' the location where I purchased it is only a couple of miles from where I live, so I can head over there and beg for help.  So Amazon .. consider a booklet of some type when you do the next upgrade,
I miss having my Google Play apps. But this phone does have a lot of nice features.
Love this phone!!!
It's a great phone
I love Amazon. I love my kindle devices. I desperately wanted to love my Fire Phone. The design seemed like a winner and I knew I want going to be getting the google play store. No big deal, I have almost all the same apps on my tablet. However... the call quality is crap. I have NO SIGNAL at home where literally everyone else has full bars no matter the carrier. It shuts down... often and for no reason. It gets hot while charging. If not for the camera I would have given this phone one star. I'm glad they discontinued this phone. Unfortunately I will be purchasing another phone as not even a signal booster helps and with a schooled aged child I cannot afford to miss calls. So, so, so very disappointed.
I was disappointed that I can't get the same apps that I have on my other phone.
:)
its ok could have the apps like google play instead of having to go to I tunes
I love this phone
Awesome phone!!!!
We purchased this phone for my wife.  Many times she has had to swipe the screen repeatedly to get the screen to change. It is too undependable and leaves much to be desired.
If you use Amazon for books, magazines, music, and or movies - this phone is a must buy!
If there has ever been a toy for adults this is it.  I received my Fire phone a few days ago and can not put it down.  It does take a while to learn how to use it but it is time well spent.  I still have a lot to learn about it but what I know so far is awesome.<br/><br/>There are features on the phone I may not use but I still think it is worth the money.  Plus Amazon gives you extras when you buy the phone.  One year of free Prime.  That is worth so much to me.  I use Prime so much that that alone is worth it.  You also get 1,000 Amazon coins for apps.  I use game apps often so that is a extra bonus.<br/><br/>You can find phones that cost a lot more than the Fire Phone and not get all the extras that come with the Fire Phone.  I feel this is a great deal.
I must preface this review by saying that I absolutely love, love, love Amazon and Amazons other companies like Zappos and such. Since I hate my Samsung GS4 (from a BB bold), I was elated to know that Amazon was releasing a phone especially since I receive a package from them at least twice a week. I received my new 64GB fire phone on Thursday 7/24/14, I wanted to barricade myself in the house and not leave for days so that I could immerse myself in this beautiful device; however I had to go to dinner. I rushed home from dinner and immediately downloaded the ATT mobile transfer app to both devices and am sad to say that the contact from my GS4 that are not in gmail would not transfer. I stayed up until about 4 am trying to get the 800 contacts to transfer to no avail. Alas, there is a mayday button and although they were friendly they could not tell me how to get the contacts to transfer. Both ATT tech support and Mayday techs were baffled and suggested that I go to a physical store in order to have the contacts transferred to my phone. Well that was another 3 hours of my life that was poorly spent, ATT does not have the Fire in their system in order to do the transfer, nor do any of the staff seem to be well versed/trained on the phone........HUGE FAIL!!!!!<br/><br/>While I am not a tech novice I do not proclaim to be a tech geek either, I am more in the middle. I also must disclose that I have never tried an iphone and that I hate all of this cloud BS for my personal information. Don't get me wrong this phone is BEAUTIFUL, I love dynamic perspective but it really has no real life purpose for me as I am not a gamer. I love the idea of Firefly however if Amazon's purpose of including this feature is to drive consumers to their site, I think they may have underestimated their consumers, 85% of my shopping is done on A.com, why go to the store when the joy of having a smiley brown package delivered by a fine man in brown shorts is waiting for you when you when you arrive home? I am already a prime member and would have spent the money to extend my membership anyway. It seems that what they should have offered was a free upgrade to the next model when it is released-if they get that far with the phone.<br/><br/>With that said, here are my issues with this phone after the first 72 hours:<br/><br/>1. It will not transfer the contacts from my GS4 because the Fire phone is not even in the system at ATT stores nor will the contacts transfer using the ATT mobile transfer app. I am an avid user of gmail (so my gmail contacts are there) however most of my contacts are on the phone and in my outlook software on the computer-not MS outlook exchange.<br/>2. I cannot use my own ringtones that I have purchased over the years for notifications like text/email/alarm, I can however customize my incoming phone call ringtone with ringtones that I own. Additionally, the stock ringtones are so similar that I have no idea whether I am receiving a text or an email-extremely frustrating.<br/>3. I am unable to individualize notifications for each email account<br/>4. I am unable to find any of my files when the phone is plugged into the computer-I discovered this when trying to place the ringtones into the notifications and ringtones folder from my computer onto the phone.<br/>5. There are no text templates (canned responses) for emails/text messages. UPDATED 7/29/14-I tried to work around this issue by using signatures in email however they are no where to be found. No one at Mayday can offer any solutions either....<br/>6. I am unable to paste to the telephone dial pad-which is especially useful since none of my contacts transferred over.<br/>7. There is no block mode/quiet time on the phone (to disable notifications during time frame, for example, I don't want to be notified of texts/emails etc between hours of 2300-900, phone calls only), the phone has to be shut down, or I have to manually go into the notifications menu and disable each application individually then remember when I wake up to turn them back on.<br/>8. Does not sync with MSoutlook pro 2007, 2010 on my computer (I understand it syncs with MS exchange)-so my appointments are not on the phone-HUGE FAIL!!!!<br/>9. Google maps/products are not on board (I am willing to give Fire's on board map software a fare chance though) and am willing to tolerate the email app which was very easy to set up.<br/><br/>These issues outlined above should be standard on a smart phone released in 2014! I just paid one million dollars (yes, my hand is inverted and my pinky is at the corner of my mouth) for this phone, I don't want to be nickeled and dimed into purchasing apps to have functionality that should be standard!!!<br/><br/>With the anticipated build up of the release of this phone these issues seem minor and I cannot believe that no thought went into this. I unfortunately will be sending the phone back, I am just torn as to whether I should send the phone back now or at the end of the 30 days, will A.com come up with an updated OS to ameliorate these issues prior to then????? Who knows.<br/><br/>UPDATE:7/29/14<br/><br/>Regarding number 5 above, there are four "I am busy" type responses that you can choose from when you receive a phone call, you can edit them to your liking.<br/>UPDATE: 7/29/14-2313 hours<br/>New issue-I would like to send a friend a happy birthday sms at exactly midnight however there is no delay text/schedule text so now I actually have to wait until midnight to the sms......smh
Over all very good. You will max out your credit card with this phone. But It makes life so much easier... I have all the iPhones 5, 5C, 5S and still prefer the Firephone
Phone is fine. Lack of meaningfull productive apps is upsetting. No google play. If you play games and watch movies all<br/>day it fine. Life is more than that. Medical apps (diabetic carb counter with excersize capabilities is non existant. Should have<br/>kept my old IPhone and waited for Amazon to catch up. Wish I didn't get it.
I am really very disappointed in the phone.  I guess I should not say the phone itself because maybe it is a good phone but, I gave up my Iphone 5, on the AT&T; network for this phone on the same network.  I have had it up and running for 4 days, my reception is almost non existent.  Same company now.....it is always searching and then there is a big E or it tells me Emergency calls.  This is on my property where I have never had a problem getting reception with any of my other phones, do not understand it.  The battery life is terrible, it runs down very quickly and I have done what AT&T; told me to do which was let the battery run completely out then completely charge it.  Did not make any difference.  I use my phone for my business as well as personal and I cannot even download the apps for my banks, which is very important to me.  Also, last but certainly NOT least, the battery gets very hot to the touch with only a small amount of use.  I am going to go back to my Iphone and hope that in the future they will do changes on this phone to make it more user freindly!
Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. I am upset that one of the Fire’s key features, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, comes with a hidden and harmful cost. Unlike Apple and Google who have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s data centers are powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary.
I am not very tech savy but I am able to navigate around on this phone. Very user friendly and fast. I love how amazon is there to help at the touch of a button.
Freezes up a lot
So far so good!!
The ideal phone.
I like it -- just have to learn how to use it. A good investment for me
I am very disappointed in this phone.  Admittedly, I am a bit electronically challenged, but this thing is anything but easy to figure out.  It is so full of neat "tricks" like tilting the phone to move a page, and so forth, that the basics of such matters as simply returning to a previous page or moving from one website to a different one is completely a mystery.  There are, no doubt, "tricks" for all these things, but I do not have time to learn or relearn things I already knew how to do on a previous phone.  I am in the process of truing to cancel the service contract and that isn't easy either.
Nifty concept. Needs some work. Should be able to customize stuff more
Misfire! I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.
This was the MOST AMAZING PHONE EVER!  I loved it so much, until AT&T; messed it all up.  ; (<br/><br/>It was inadvertently charging me for data when I was on my Wi-Fi at home and it shouldn't have been.  AT&T; wouldn't reverse those charges, so I turned it off!  AT&T; was the only carrier, so that was a wrap, now Have no Fire phone and it sucks.  AT&T; caused this by being so rigid with such an experimental phone saying that we must be incorrect, that it cost them, And Amazon's new phone, two ex-customers. (Who were otherwise thrilled!)  MAYBE next time Amazon.  But this won't deter me from buying again though!
Forget everything written by the 1 & 2 star people - I dare say, "they be talking through their sad hats"!!! I've had this phone for two weeks and I LOVE my Fire Phone!! It's FAST, Its beautiful, Has GREAT SOUND, totally easy to use, all apps work great and for those android apps you want - got to sideloadmyfirephone.com &/or 1mobile.com and load the apt file - they all work and all work fabulously. There is nothing that isn't great about this phone. And the camera? faster, smoother, better details/colors than the iPhone 4s I traded in. I wanted this phone since it was announced and now I have it - I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER. Once again, it works, it works great . the battery, well i use it all day along with my mac air and kindle 8.9 HDX and the battery has NEVER fallen below 56% at day's end - usually in the early evening it runs about 62% CHARGE LEFT, It does NOT bend and NO it does NOT get warm either! NOT AT ALL!<br/>I do wish some of the alternative keyboards would be workable on the firephone, that is the only 'app' I have not been successful in installing in this phone.....Thats a small price to pay for this phone's overall quality!<br/>BUY THIS PHONE, you'll be very very very happy......oh did I tell you I LOVE my Fire Phone?....I do, i certainly totally do. (from a former Palm Pre Plus, iPhone 4, & iPhone 4s owner...this time I got it right
Honestly love the phone on its appearance it just looks so pretty. It is missing tons of apps like snapchat and Google maps etc. It crashes a lot and over heats while I use it. It takes amazing pictures and is actually pretty fast but if I could buy my way out of a contract and get an iPhone... I would
love this phone
So far...Great!
Battery get hot
Pay no attention to the low ratings on this phone, it is an organized effort by communist based greenpeace to protest Amazons cloud servers and how they are powered.  Nothing to do with how phone works.  Just buy it if you like the services it provides....or better yet buy it to tick off the local marxists red diaper babies.
Its looks like a good phone. It has a great camera. Battery can last awhile if you just leave it on standby. But if your planning on using this phone for games, apps, gps, streaming movies, etc. on a daily basis then this phone is not for you. First this phone is only good for calling, texting and picture taking. It is not a good phone for productivity. Also most Android apps do not work properly with this phone. Many of them keeps on stalling and needs to be shut down. Amazon really needs to have the Google marketplace and be able to use the play store not a third party app store.
Love this phone. Switched from an iPhone and could not be happier.
All in all I like the fire phone with the exception of two things.  I previously had a Samsung Focus windows phone.  If I was in my car and I received  a text message, it would automatically come across the bluetooth in my Kia Optima.  With the Fire phone, it no longer does this.  If I had known that ahead of time, I probably would not have bought the phone.  Also, the charge time when the phone is in use does not seem to be that long.  I love the free Amazon Prime and the firefly feature, but the text message issue and the charge time is what brings it down to only 3 stars.
I think the phone is great!  And the price cannot be beat.  I can't think of any bells & whistles they left off.  Also, the service from the Mayday staff is outstanding.  Do I-phones have this?  I don't know but it is a great service to have.  I'm glad my wife and I each got Fire Phones!!
Some applications fail. Rather have a. Back button. Battery life.
Very complicated at first but I actually really like te phone now
It's a little slow when getting into and out of apps. I don't care for the auto scroll feature on the phone. I like the Amazon features on it, especially the music. Getting free music to listen to is great. I have been an iPhone user for years but I didn't want to upgrade to the iPhone 6 because of the cost. This phone is definitely not worth the $449 that AT&T; charges but it does the job. I can call out and receive calls. I can search the web and listen to music. I can't get my bank app along with a few others. All in all it's functional but I wouldn't choose it again.
The Amazon Fire Phone is a pretty good phone, but it needs a lot of work. First off, the Appstore lacks many of the apps I wish to download. I couldn't even get a simple app like Snapchat. Even at that, the apps that I do download won't update. Settings on the phone are very limited, personalization wise. You cannot set a wallpaper, and lock screen designs are very limited as well. You can set your own photo as your lock screen, put the location of the time and date makes it difficult to read. This could be a very good phone, but it just needs a lot of improvements.
I like many things about Amazon as a Prime member ... however blocking all Google apps on Fire Phone  ... this is a completely impossible path to go ... for me the reason not to purchase this phone ... as Google is simply the best email experience ever also many other apps I don't wanna miss as they are just great  ... so surely no Fire Phone until this has changed.
Its a good phone but still needs improvement in some minor areas
I REALLY wanted to love this phone. I bought it despite the bad reviews. I thought I could make it work and that people were exaggerating. I consider myself well-versed in technology. I am usually the person my friends bring their tech questions and problems to, but this phone is just CRAP. I have had to do TWO factory resets in just the six days I have owned it, and my free PRIME membership has not worked a single day. The system keeps trying to charge my card $99.<br/><br/>I am SO over it...I am returning this and getting either the Galaxy 5 or the M8 as I should have originally.<br/><br/>Badly done Amazon!
Awesome phone has so many cool features the camera is awesome 13 megapixels duh and it's tuned by amazon it's really fast and it does everything I need it to do the dynamic perspective is so cool and reading on this phone is awsome firefly is cool too best phone I've ever had :)
The phone it's self is good and the I like the camera as well. The problem I have is that I cannot access Apps that I use daily because they're not in the Amazon app store. Shame on me for not doing my homework on this feature or lack there of. I'm not very tech savvy so I've tried everything I could find on line on how to download apps from Google but to no avail. If Amazon doesn't carry the App you want, you're out of luck. Now I'm stuck in this phone for the next 2 years unless I buy another outright and I'm VERY tempted.<br/>Buyer beware.......
Best phone yet
Great phone!!!
I was thrilled to have ordered and having the Fire phone, only problem is less than two months of having the phone, it goes on sale for $0.99 after I just paid $299.00. Quite honestly, I find that rather bothersome, Amazon! I mean really?I would really like to return it.
I love my new phone.  It's my first smart phone so I have had to use the Mayday customer service people quite a few times.  They are always nice and always help me out with my questions. I also love the daily wall paper that shows up on my phone.  It's an awesome phone!
This phone is as smart as other phones in the market. If you are a prime member, this is the best phone for you. The downside is that the fire phone is not linked to Google Play, so selection of apps are not wide spread. Also, for $0.99, you can't go wrong.
The phone has a spectacular lok, it's works sharp always, brings lots of usefull apps! The display is something new that I never saw on a phone before. In synthesis is a phone that offers much more than expected. I recommend it, it's really outstanding.
Great quality
Yes, It Did!!
Love(ing) it!
WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!<br/><br/>Oh, I'm NOT referring to the product, which I'm not actually reviewing. What I AM doing is warning FOX viewers that seemingly ALL of the bad reviews are part of a campaign of SABOTAGE by environmental wackos. Read 'em and weep for your country. What a surprise! Al Gore's zombies don't like coal and oil. Just for this, head out on a pleasure drive for the weekend, like we did back in the day. Fire up the generator, while it's hooked up to nothing whatsoever, and let it run for an hour or three. You're welcome, for the head's-up.
Love my Fire Phone. Only thing is it is a little touchie
I have had this phone not quite two months. I'm not a big cell phone person, but needed to upgrade to a smartphone. As I write this, my husband is currently on his way to the AT&T; store AGAIN (The same people who charged a ridiculous amounts of money to change over to this phone on our phone plan. Pay attention to that bill when it comes in because AT&T; tries some shady stuff.) because the phone will not turn on. I have barely used this and now it doesn't work. Today I had to go in for an outpatient medical procedure and really needed a phone that WORKS and this won't even TURN ON. It's hot like it is charging, but no picture. Now I feel as if I am stuck with an expensive piece of unreliable junk. I have heart problems and rely on a cell phone for emergencies. I can't have a phone that doesn't work. I can't begin to tell you how angry and disappointed I am with Amazon for marketing this piece of garbage. My advise to you is to purchase another phone. ANY other phone. Preferably one that works. My ancient pink flip phone (go ahead and laugh) still works; this doesn't. Need I say more?
The email have to be opened in order to delete them. Some emails I usually see the subject line and have no need to open it. There should be a way to do that. The 'flipping the phone to the left or right' feature does not work most of the time
This is a preliminary review based on a couple of days usage. I'm switching from a Blackberry, so this is my first real smartphone.<br/>Bought the Fire because I like Amazon in general, have a Kindle Fire HDX and already have a lot of books, music etc in the Amazon.com "cloud." Thought the Fire would be a nice addition, and so far think it is.<br/><br/>What I like: easy to use, immediately integrated with my Amazon account and assets, great sound.<br/><br/>Interesting features: Nice that I can access certain features with one-handed gestures. Firebug is cool, but doubt I'll use it much. Mayday is a better feature which I think could come in handy from time to time when I get stuck.<br/><br/>What needs improvement: The battery runs down too fast, especially if you use any of the advanced functions. Also a bit heavier and thicker than a Samsung which my wife uses.<br/><br/>Overall: Happy with my purchase but hope/expect Amazon to make significant improvements on its next iteration.
The Fire Phone is very awkward after having full-android phones for years. Half of the apps I use daily aren't available through the Amazon AppStore. The Camera is fantastic, as is the sound. Video is a bit dim.dark, but fine. No Google Services (voice, wallet, drive...) Can't customize with wallpaper or backgrounds. Kinda dull. The Prime features (video & music) however, are awesome, and frankly, the main reason I got the phone.  Love amazon, Learning to like the phone...
i have never owned a smart phone before but i have had my kindle fire for a couple of years and I love the combination of the 2. Don't get me wrong I still use my kindle but being on the go its great to have it all in one place.
I like the phone so far it doesn't have any of my banking apps, Google chrome or youtube. The mayday feature didn't work very well. And I can'tfind  full manual to learn more about it. But hopefully these reviews will help
Unbelievable that in the majority of the one star reviews, mentioned the not use of clean energy as a motive of the low score. Liberals and leftists politically motivated have no scruples to show their agenda. Amazon should deleted all that crap.<br/>The phone is the first generation, go back to the first I-phone or the first Android and you will see many, many more flaws that in this phone. Be fair and objective, don't let the liberal media wash your brain.
Just tried to buy the $1 Fire phone. When I added the AT&T; contract my bill increased buy $25 a month. Make sure you look at the plan price it is easy to miss.<br/><br/>This $1 phone would cost me $600 over the 2 years.
After being the last person in town to finally get a smartphone ...finally took a chance on a brand new one. Glad I did...based on one day of exploring and playing with it I'm impressed, entertained and happy with my new gadget. Easy to learn...great support...excellent camera...superb sound and great picture quality. Suspect I'll keep finding new features and uses for quite a while.<br/><br/>Very nice job Amazon!
I have been fighting to even like this phone since I bought it on August 13. I am the $700 loser, caught between AT&T; and Amazon. I didn't know it was possible to hate a phone. Hoping the first one was defective, I now have a replacement, which also isn't anything I had hoped for. You should know that, unlike iTunes and Google, your contacts don't get backed up, so I'm sitting here writing this review because I can't call anyone. The phone reads heat and moisture, so going outside on a hot day can cause your pocket to turn on the phone and the flashlight and call a contact and hit Mayday.... all about at once... I guess the developers sat in their air conditioned offices completely clueless.... WiFi turns itself off, making your cellular data skyrocket, if you aren't paying attention every minute.... the charger socket on the phone I just returned shared a problem one of my Kindles has, that is, it has to be aligned just so or charging stops... but the front screen doesn't tell you if it's charging or not, you have to go through two screens to find out, and the cord can move while in the car... oh, this wouldn't be such a problem but I haven't succeeded in getting the battery to last a whole work day, let alone a whole day into the evening... I one went from 22 percent to 4 percent in 11 minutes, her fact I know because I have become paranoid about the battery in this phone. My 2 1/2 year old iPhone with original battery does better, even when the kids watch movies or play games.... AT&T; doesn't care about any of the CONSTANT problems, but no surprise there, and the MayDay people seem to be trained by AT&T....; "what do you want me to do?" Complete with shrug of the shoulder.<br/>Save yourself lots of headaches and money. Hopefully Amazon will develop a conscience where this phone and it's victims are concerned.<br/>I guess I should mention, I love my Kindles, have bought 8 over the years, 3 stolen, unfortunately, 2 eventually broke, but that took three years and better, still own and use 3 kindle fires, so I was prepared to love this ridiculous phone. So sorry Amazon let me down.<br/><br/>This is an update, and today is November 5. The instant video works pretty well. The zoom ion the camera works... Not at all. Because of amazon and AT&T; attitudes I've acquired an iPhone 6 from Verizon. I just use the Fire phone as a Very Expensive Kindle Fire, with the added benefit that I don't need to turn on a hotspot when we use it in the car.<br/><br/>I'm embarrassed for Amazon. The mayday advisors are useless in the face of the poor design, poor implementation, many flaws.<br/><br/>It's dramatic in the movies when a character is advised to "save yourself." Sorry I can't provide drama, but "save yourself!".
I knew I wanted this phone the moment I saw the demonstration. My previous phone was a Galaxy S4 and while it was great, I found the camera and music apps lacking.<br/><br/>The Fire Phone gets 4 out of 5 stars because so far it has been one of the best phones I've owned.  When I got it in the mail and started working on it, I noticed that I couldn't get the play store app. All my google services would not be allowed on this phone. That was the main setback for this phone. If it had the Play Store on it, I would be giving this phone a 5 star rating. I did find a way to get my apps onto this phone and now I'm happy with that.<br/><br/>As far as the other features on the phone - well they are as they are described. The camera is really good, the sound is really good and the display is awesome.  This is a must have for someone who uses Amazon as much as my wife and I do.
Good phone.
Great phone

Nice phone.
Sorry Amazon. I love your company, but this new phone of yours is way overpriced for what you get.<br/><br/>The phone has a nice screen, it has a solid build, and it's easy to use. But the extra features it has that cause it to be rather expensive aren't worth it.<br/><br/>I have a Kindle Fire HDX 7" tablet and I really like it. So I figured I'd give the Amazon Fire phone a shot. Amazon's tablets are priced lower than most other tablets, so when I heard Amazon was coming out with a phone, I figured it was going to be cheap. I was really surprised that Amazon decided to price the 32GB version of this phone at $649 and the 64GB version at $749! Yikes!  What happened to Amazon selling their devices at cost and making money off of people buying things on the device?  I guess that strategy went out the window.<br/><br/>After all, for the same $749 you can get a 32GB iPhone 5s or spend only $649 on a 16GB Samsung Galaxy S5 and add a cheap memory card, which altogether would be cheaper than the 64GB version of the Amazon Fire phone.<br/><br/>In any case, I thought maybe the new fancy features of the Amazon Fire phone would make it worthwhile. So I figured what the heck, I'll give it a shot.<br/><br/>After using it, I have decided the extra features aren't worth it, and I think at $749 the phone is way too expensive. I'm going to return it and get another phone. At around $400 - $499 I think the 64GB Amazon Fire phone would be a good deal. Hey Amazon, lower the price!<br/><br/>Here are some of the main features and what I thought about them:<br/><br/>Tilt controls (Called Dynamic Perspective) - This uses 4 cameras on each corner of the phone. You can tilt the phone, or tilt your head, to scroll up or down or to expose extra information on the screen. I can see some apps, especially games, taking advantage of this. It's a neat trick, but most of the time it didn't work very well. I found that most of the time it's easier to just swipe.<br/><br/>Firefly - It uses the camera to identify products that you can then buy on Amazon. It works reasonably well, but there is already an Amazon app that does the same thing, and the app works fine.<br/>(Firefly is also supposed to identify movies and TV shows, which the regular Amazon app doesn't do, but I don't watch a lot of TV, so I haven't tried that out.)<br/><br/>Camera - This is a good camera. Not sure if it's the best camera phone which is what Amazon seems to be claiming. But it is definitely one of the better phone cameras. So I have no problem with the camera on this phone.<br/><br/>Amazon app store - It doesn't have all the apps that Google or Apple has, but it has most of the ones that I wanted. So it's good enough for me. (Although for other people it might be a problem.)<br/><br/>Mayday - This contacts you to a live Amazon customer services rep on the screen. I have used this service a few times on my Kindle Tablet to get questions answered, and it works well. I have not had to use it on this phone yet, because the phone has been pretty easy to figure out.<br/><br/>Ease Of Use - This is a very easy phone to use.<br/><br/>AT&T; Only - This phone only works on AT&T.; Not a big deal for me since AT&T; has good service in my area. But that might be a deal breaker for you if you prefer to stay on Verizon, Sprint, or T-Mobile.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION - It's a decent phone. But if you want to spend $749 on a phone, I can't see why you would buy this phone. For that kind of money, I think an iPhone 5s or one of the Samsung phones like the Galaxy S5 is a better deal. In fact, there are lots of other phones that give you better bang for your buck. So I'm returning this phone.<br/><br/>My suggestion to you is to either:<br/>1. Wait for Amazon to drastically drop the price of this phone.<br/>2. Wait for the 2nd version of this phone, by which time hopefully Amazon has figured out a way to turn some of the new features into something really worthwhile, instead of just cool gimmicks.<br/>3. Like I said before, if you want to spend $749 on a phone, there are better options. Right now, the Amazon Fire phone is not worth $649 for the 32GB version, or $749 for the 64Gb version.<br/><br/>Sorry Amazon. I love your company, I love Prime, I love my Kindle, but this new phone of yours isn't worth it.
I've had this since it came out. Really a horrible phone.<br/><br/>Many apps will not work, even apps that are in the Amazon app store and will work on their fire tablets. For example, the US Bank application available in the Amazon app store is not compatible with the phone. I can't imagine what they did to make so many android apps not work.<br/><br/>Also, simple things like answering the phone can be hard.Lets say the phone rings and you pick it up but your thumb happens to touch the screen, it may put you in another app. You will have to quit the app just to answer the ringing call!<br/><br/>Also, there are two music apps - prime music and amazon music. One has your free prime music, the other has your paid music. Why aren't these available in the same app?<br/><br/>What is good? Swipe with your thumb to go back. The screensavers are nice to look at.

I am a dyed-in-the-wool Amazon enthusiast. I have genuinely admired their business model and desire to please their customers.<br/><br/>So, I was stunned when my Fire phone arrived and couldn't interact with the Google Play Store or use Google Apps.<br/><br/>This fact was not stated in any of the pre-release language from Amazon. Now I am utterly cut off from using all of my Google media and applications that I purchased from them (ones that I can't purchase from the Amazon App Store).<br/><br/>In the end, I've paid $300 for a 64GB device that disenfranchises me from more than half of my media and functionality.<br/><br/>Amazon has taken the wrong path by launching a technology product that limits shoppers to using Amazon only. Surely the global merchandiser must remember that Macy's does better when it sends customers to Gimbels...
Great phone it has everything needed and more.
If you want to salvage your wasted money from buying this joke of a phone, Root it and download Cyanogenmod 11 on it. At least then you would have a true android 4.4.4 phone with play store access.
I hoped I would love this phone when I ordered it.  When I got it, I tried to like this phone.  I love everything about Amazon and I absolutely HATE this phone.  I've had it for 3 months and I finally gave up, paid off my contract and bought a new phone, which cost me a small fortune.  Here is my main list of complaints:  1) Only Kindle Fire apps.  If I had known that, I wouldn't have even thought about it.  I was hopeful that more developers would join in once the phone caught on, but since this is such a terrible phone, it didn't.  ESPN Sports Center said "Coming Soon!" for a while and apparently they thought better of the idea because it is no longer listed.  The apps that are available are seriously second rate versions of the iPhone apps I'm used to.  2) It gets stuck often, restarts itself on a regular basis, randomly opens apps and menu screens, and generally just does not work at all.  3) It does not notify me of missed calls and voicemails on a consistent basis.  I missed a call back for a job interview because the phone took 3 days to let me know I had a missed call and a voicemail.  4) It stores photos in a seemingly random order.  They're never in the same order every time I open my photos.  Why?  5) The voice command does not recognize a single thing I ask it.  I tried something as simple as "check the weather" and I get "Sorry I can't do that yet.  I can: make calls, send messages, send emails, search the web."  6) The home button which should wake up the phone when it is asleep stopped working about 2 weeks after I got the phone.  7) The battery lasts about an hour at this point.
One of the Fire's key features, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, comes with a hidden and harmful cost. Unlike Apple and Google who have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, Amazon's data centers are powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. The Fire's reliance on dirty energy isn't cutting edge, and it's completely unnecessary.
First off. Buttons constantly get pressed while in your pocket. found my pocket getting hot because flashlight was turned on. battery almost died because of it. they should make it so the  buttons have to be double pressed quickly like a computer mouse before they respond. had to lock phone too, not to keep people from using it, but because it kept pocket dialing people. thought pocket dial was a thing of the past. Guess I got spoiled by my Nokia Lumia windows phone over the last 2 years. gonna go back to it I think. The only upside is the years worth of amazon prime. but even with that, I already get most of the same video content on Netflix. Amazon prime music is nice though. They rave about the 3d screen and perspective. but its not 3d the way they would make you think. nothing pops out of the screen and nothing pops in (like a diorama view). instead its 3d like an xbox 360 or ps3. you have the ability to look around the background. kind of like the right joy stick on a video game controller in first person shooters. only instead of a joystick, you tilt the phone in a direction to look around. no good apps/games that use this feature, so its just a gimmick. The firefly feature that's suppose to recognize numbers takes for ever to recognize what you want it too. especially if its printed small like on a business card. and then when it does work it will only let you pick one thing to save. so say a business card said " Bob Smith, (978)555 1212, personal accountant" it would ask you which of those 3 facts you want to store. it wouldn't store bob smiths number as 978 555 1212. you'd have to let it store 978 555 1212 and then type bob smith. its much quicker to just dial a number and the save it yourself then to use firefly.Was gonna give it 3 stars, but now that i'm done reviewing the phone  i'm actually more disappointed with it so 2 stars it is.
I really like it but I wish it had more apps.
I love it! Completely awesome in every way!!!
The concept is great. But the only good thing about the phone was the year of prime for free. Mine keeps restarting and half of the time the screen won't light up for a minute or two after I try to use it. It's always freezing. I also hate that you don't get any notifications on the top bar regarding email, texts or games. . It just doesn't seem to work.. unfortunately I am stuck in a contract with it.
Phones depend on their cloud and Amazon's cloud is powered by dirty energy. Use iphone's phone instead/ its cloud uses 100% clean energy. Phone "clouds" should contribute to preserving the earth not destroying its life!
Well it's been more than a year since I decided to make the switch. I used to be an iphone user but decided to try something new and different. For the longest I have been wanting to get my hands on a Sony Xperia but opted for the Fire Phone. I try really hard to stay positive and not listen to all the bad reviews the phone got but at this point I have given up. If it's not one thing it's another that goes wrong with this phone. I'm really frustrated with this phone and can hardly wait to get rid of it. I just would of liked for Amazon to apologize to customers that spend their hard earn money on this phone and to make things right reenburst customers with some sort of credit. I like Amozon but definitely I will not be waiting to see what the new fire phone has to offer. Sony Xperia Z5 here I come :)
Being a loyal Prime user and early adapter of this phone just cost me $199 now that it's already basically free. Amazon really needs to issue refunds to those of us who went out on a limb and believed in this phone and suffered through all it's flaws (and continue to because we can't afford a phone out of contract). I used to love Amazon, now I just feel burned and disrespected.
nice phone
Awesome to
Not the best phone in the world. Very glitchy. If I were amazon I would have waited another month till they realized it and worked on it a little more. But the 3D feature is neat.
The Amazon app store is less than expected
Love it! Great phone! Many great features!
The phone is good it does bog down sometimes in starting apps but the reason for 3 stars is the app store it sucks. As soon as possible I'm probably going back to an iPhone.
A global company like Amazon should take more responsibility and have its products run on clean, renewable energy resources. Additionally, this item is overpriced. Most certainly I'll recommend everyone I know against buying the Fire Phone.
Why?  Powering the Fire Phone with dirty energy is a real turn-off!
EST Amazon fire phone meets all my needs
No Google store...<br/><br/>No Google store..lack of apps I need for everyday use.  I gave phone to my mom she said it was OK for her all she want is use of phone.<br/><br/>The Amazon app store is geared towards 5 and 10 year olds which I think amazon should sell it phone in a toysrus store.<br/>Amazon adults buy your phone you need to gear apps more for adults than kids.<br/>Also it was a little buggy could not often times hard to select backward button takes to long when it should have been one of the easiest to do.<br/>Overall phone is OK for talking ..looks good ..solid feel ..nice 3d is about I can say good about this phone!
Worst phone I've ever owned. Had the iphone 4 for years and wanted to get the fire phone because I love Amazon. Too bad they dropped the ball with this one spent an additional 40 bucks to get an incipio case and the first small drop cracks the screen. It is supposed to be gorilla glass but my iPhone 4 never cracked despite much worse drops and a cheaper case. Same thing happened to the one I got my wife. On top of that the phone was glitchy with buttons that only seemed to work some of the time even before the drop.
I decided to try something new after using Windows Phones the last few years. I have to say I miss some of the windows phones features especially on the home screen. But over all this is an ok phone. The O/S needs more features becides that I really like using amazon dor purchases and Prime features. If it wasnt for Amazon rhis phone would be a 2 star
Just wanted to say to everyone, you may not have access to all of the android apps. But if you download 1 android,  you have access to majority of the apps.  ijs
Still learning some things on the fire phone,but so far I like it. It"s clear screen is better in the sun than my galaxy and music sounds awesome on it also.
Don't rely on the negative reviews to steer away from this device!  Go to your ATT Wireless Store.  Touch it, Hold it and Use it.  This phone is VERY nice.  Not too small (iPhone), not too big (Galaxy or HTC One M8), not too heavy.  Interface is good (familiar to any current Fire Tablet user), screen is outstanding.  I have been a happy Prime customer and for me this does enhance the overall experience.  You should really go and give the Fire Phone a test run before buying anything else.<br/><br/>One (temporary) complaint.  Software version at launch does not appear to support Bluetooth LE, the hardware is there, so some of your other devices, like mine, will not work until OS is update (at least that is what I have read).  Not a deal breaker for me I can wait.<br/><br/>Amazon App Store has most of the apps that are important to me.  Where certain apps are not available, I been been able to "sideload" without many problems.  Apps that require Google Play Services are not fully operation on Fire and the Starbucks App that I used on my M8 will not run.  Minor issues that should be resolve in the near future (Come on Starbucks!).<br/><br/>Anyway, I am very impressed with this phone based on its initial launch and only expect it to get better.<br/><br/>So just go check it out yourself!
Awesome!!
Love it!!
I love it
I want to be able to install apps that I want to install, cutting off certain google apps is just stupid. It brings up the learning curve when making a switch from one phone to the next, and you shouldn't be afraid of competition. Makes you look weak if you don't think your app will make the cut and you have to force it yourself. Lastly, making this only At&t; was a mistake. At&t; has horrible reception in a multitude of places I visit, and where I currently live. Don't bind yourself to one carrier, especially if that carrier isn't the absolute best.<br/><br/>Mayday isn't important. I will literally never use it. It seems to be for people who have never owned a smartphone before, which is a population that is currently dwindling.<br/><br/>Looking forward to the Fire 2.0. Hopefully we can address some of the changes to make this a viable alternative.
Phone is good, especially the display and camera. Overall meets my expectation except one very important factor - power. This phone is extremely power hungry.
The Amazon Fire Phone has a few app shortfalls.  I am not able to get apps for the NFL Mobile site or for my local banks.  I am pleased that my phone and Kindle Fire HD use the same charging system, which is one of the reasons that I bought it.  Amazon has to support many more apps if they want to be competitive with Samsung, Galaxy, or LD.
Well I have had it for 3 days now. Still can't sync my contacts from my old phone. Can't sync with my pc. Can't sync with my car(Bluetooth). I haven't given up yet, but so far this phone is anti-social. I have tried the "mayday" tech support ... 3 times. I always get a "tech" right away, but they don't seem to be able to help. They told me to go in to an AT&T; store to resolve my sync problems, but the guy at the store was even less knowledgeable. I realize this phone is really new, but so far I am not impressed.<br/><br/>I miss my old phone out dated phone.
It works, and I love Firefly.  The OS is, otherwise, clunky.  Updates will download and fail to install.  I'm close to calling to see if I can return it.
The phone is so cool. I got snapchat to work and sideloaded google services. Works like a charm. Everyone thinks it's so cool with the dynamic perspective. That is the main reason I got it. I bought it new on eBay for $ 130. It makes a great backup phone. The battery fires fairly fast if used a lot. Buy a portable battery charger.
Absolutely LOVE this phone!!!!!!!! I'm not a techy-weenie type person but this phone has so much to offer! It's been simple so far and if I have ANY difficulties I can contact my  May day feature on my phone and the person on the other end walks me through the issue till I understand. I really love this phone!! But I think one of my most favorite feature so far has got to be the verbal texting!!!! I talk faster than I type, so this feature helps out a lot!! I almost feel like I'm dictating into my phone to a secretary.<br/>If you've been wondering if you should trade or switch to the new Amazon fire phone; do it, you won't regret it!
Very simple phone. The camera was good. The firefly thing is actually pretty cool. The enternet is fast. The pricing was good. The battery last a while.
Its very awesome
Great. Fun phone
Great phone.  Even for this baby boomer.  Easy to use and to read.
I bought this phone to replace my aging iPhone 4S because the battery on the 4S is all but dead.  I also intended to replace my 4S because I don't like using iTunes.  Uploading pictures via USB is much easier.  I liked the fact that Amazon tossed in another year of Prime because I use Prime at least once a week but even so, this phone has too many issues for me to keep.  First off, it gets hot to the touch.  Sometimes very hot.  I don't know what causes this but this is not good.  The camera is fine, the speakers are lousy.  The software is very buggy.  I added my own "picture" to the lock screen and after I did that, the lock screen locked up.  There was no provision to undo my picture or replace it.  I had to do a total reset to clear it out.  Then, I downloaded a ringtone maker app and it locked up as well.  I had to delete the app in order to return to the home page.  The phone does make decent calls and texting is easy.  Email works okay too but Firefly is a joke.  It couldn't even recognize it's own box.  I haven't tried the "Mayday" feature yet and probably won't.  The battery life is below average as well.
Good quality phone but with some shortcomings.  Unable to sync calendars,contact lists and others with my Amazon Fire Tablet HD 8.9.  Several apps that are compatible with phone are not with tablet and some with tablet not with phone.  Since these are both Amazon products you would thing compatibility would not be an issue but it is. Support is good but you need to go to two different support areas (Phone/Tablet) for syncing problems. Would like to see enhanced voice controls which are currently limited to voice or text calls.<br/>Other than these issues, the phone works well.
There were a number of things that I liked about the Fire Phone, but there were too many limitations with only the use of the Amazon store.
it works
Love it.
Awesome!
Love it.
Just love it.  So easy to use.  No weird screens or sequences; the working screen is good size so you really CAN watch movies, TV, Etc.
I checked this out and this totally sucks! This is a very poor piece of hardware and the performance leaves a lot to be desired. There is a clear time lag in opening apps and videos hang too. The firefly does not work as advertised - it has a patchy performance and does not catch half the objects that you scan. Please do yourself a favor and go for a good android phone such as the One Plus One or Google Nexus 5.<br/>What better proof of the phone's failure than the fact that it was discounted from $199.99 to $0.99 within a month of the launch? :)
Nice phone just hard to navigate
I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn't that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. Amazon must commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.
I bought this phone when it first came out. I thought I was buying the latest Smartphone. I was wrong. This phone is barely a step above a basic cell phone. Amazon is a great online shopping site. However I do like to buy local at times and the apps you can download for example to a iphone Lowes hardware, hobby lobby etc. Forget those apps if you buy the fire. If Amazon sells the product(s) that you could buy local, they will not offer these apps because they want you to buy only from them. This is just a overpriced basic cell phone. DO NOT BUY
I don't like how it uses data for everything! I share data with 3 other people and my phone just eats it all up for stupid reasons.
I was not made aware when I purchased the Amazon Fire Phone that it would not connect to Wii Fi.  The help person on the phone says it only connects through ATT.  Therefore, I cannot make phone calls nor text in my home.<br/><br/>I should have kept my iPhone.  At least I could use it.  I am disabled and basically homebound and I cannot call for help when I need it.  I wish I could send it back.  I spent nearly $800 for it.  No happy at all.
Very cool and intriguing device
The phone functions terribly. The OS is slow and glitchy. I hate the apps and they are not user friendly. I miss my old phone.
The worst phone! I am not an "electronics snob" but this is garbage. You cannot use some of the most common apps (including the square card reader). The charging port has to be the cheapest one they could possibly put it. It will start and stop charging itself every other second as it sits untouched on the counter. And it does that with several different chargers. I got two of these phones (one for me, one for my wife) and they both have the same problems, so it is not an issue with a single device.
Purchased the Fire through AT&T; Wireless on September 15th. 2014 and I am shipping it back to them today, I am exchanging it for the Windows 8, Nokia Lumia 1520. If you really look at these reviews before buy, Take heed to this one! This phone is an utter P.O.S.!!! Barely 30 days old the phone began to flash the screen, turn itself on and off for no reason. I take very good care of my phones. You cannot clear your call history, You cannot change the default message tones they can only be changed for people in your contact list. The Contact list is very unorganized. Good luck finding a high quality case with belt clip for it. You can't use Google play android apps, they must be from Android - Amazon says this can be changed but it never worked for me. The phone has a horrible internal antenna - I've had more dropped calls in the Fire than any other phone I have owned over the last 10 plus years. Firefly would not recognize a business card like the video shows, it handles Q codes ok but the recognition of the camera is horrid. I went from a Blackberry Z10 to the Fire and regret it, the BB was junk but the Fire was by far much worse. Amazon customer support was worthless, you always get someone named Bill, Bob or Sue but none of them can speak English well enough to understand your problem thus you never get the solution you want. I use my phone on the road to listen to music and this thing has major glitches in the music player, your better off listening to iHeart than try to use the music player. Found the phone quite un-user friendly, no home screen or decent stand-by screen. If your looking at this phone for the 1 year prime membership you are better off paying for Prime. Amazon completely dropped the ball on the Fire! This is not the phone you want, Trust me. In my opinion the only use for this phone is to lure the customer in to purchase more Amazon products. The next best use for the Fire is target practice.
This phone is sadly underdeveloped and it shows. I really enjoy using Amazon.com's website for purchases. EBay is better for me when purchasing parts for my motorcycle but for everything else I use Amazon. I thought that because the site is so awesome the phone would be great. Sadly I should have listened to the reviews from the online tech sites that reviewed the phone before the phone launched. One had said that the phone was nothing special and full of cheesy gimmicks like the 3D Perspective, firefly and so on. Boy were they right. 3D Perspective is cool but definitely not a must have. I barely use firefly. Can't support my banks App. Phone is small for web browsing in a world of now a day giants. Only comes in black. Could have been great if they would have spent another two years in R&D.; I absolutely hate this phone for being my first Smart Phone. iPhone Plus, here I come!!! I highly recommend that you stay away from this phone. You have so many other better options out there. Samsung and IPhone have amazing devices. I have heard horror stories about Sony. Just get a samsung or iPhone and save yourself grief.
Not completely satisfied with the phone because the operating system isn't Android or Apple but something in between and only some of the apps work on it and data usage is astronomical. The call quality is awesome though. Maybe it needs to be a phone and not a smart phone
It's a beautiful but heavy phone. Most apps are not available, including ALL Google apps. If you just want to make calls, text, surf the the web, watch movies (no Youtube though), it's a good phone, otherwise it's useless.
Love it
Love it
I am not thrilled about this phone.  It needs to be rebooted often.  It goes off occasionally.  It is not user friendly.  I wish I hadn't bought it and now I am stuck with it.
Well I was happy with previous kindle.phone tell batteries fried after only 6 months ..hasle.getting new phone..also.concerned no.new fire phone developments..like the fact it compliments my kindle notebook and I hope amazon.will.improve and update both products
I absolutely love this phone. All the little details really make a difference. Firefly is really neat, even if it doesn't recognize everything. I bet if I were in an environment where I needed it..such as a store to check Amazon's price against the store I was at...it won't let me down. It did recognize shows I was watching, so that was very impressive AND addicting;-) The camera is AWESOME! Dynamic perspective is so beautiful and a neat feature. The clarity is superb. I used Mayday the first night to ask a quick question, and she was very helpful. I would highly recommend this phone to any and all. Thank you, Amazon, for thinking of the tiniest of details for me, the customer. That's the Amazon I know and LOVE!!! Thank you!  OMG...lastly...THANK YOU FOR EXTENDING MY PRIME MEMBERSHIP. My Amazon relationship has been the best relationship I've ever been in:p
Love this phone! So many things to do & still learning everyday the things it can do for much less than most others.
There certainly needs to be some updating.done in the near future. Hopefully starting with the  ability to clear call logs and texts more than one at a time. It would be nice to set up separate photo albums so as to differentiate work, family, art....pictures.
The Fire could be MUCH better. I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.
I absolutely love my new Amazon Fire phone. I have not had any of the problems some of the others have mentioned.
The caller's voice is garbled, although the caller can hear me, no one can understand what the caller is saying
Decent at best. The software is very buggy. The dynamic perspective is a little gimmicky but fun.The phone locks up when I try to unlock it sometimes because of the DP. My speakers are also have static. Need to bring it in. Phone has potential though.
I absolutely love my phone.
Great Promise - Crippled by Bezos Obstinance<br/><br/>Great Hardware. Purchased only because: 1. ATT is the only cell tower here on Lake George in the Adirondacks, 2. About to be charged $99 for a year of Prime,  and 3. Go-phone charges were eating me alive with $10 nag calls over and over.<br/><br/>So I bit...<br/><br/>If you have never used anything Google - perhaps you may be happy with this thing. But Bezos absolute stupidity in preventing compatibility with anything Google, will drive you nuts.<br/><br/>Harvard Business School 101 teaches - when you are a miniscule share of the market - be compatible with the market leader - in this case - Google.<br/><br/>Did Bezos do this? NO - the idiot made it as hard as possible to use anything Google.<br/><br/>With perseverance, you can get Gmail to side-load. Chrome browser also seems to side-load. Youtube - no. GoogleMaps - no.<br/><br/>Google services crash repeatedly - you need to get used to it - they are still running but the 'crash' messages come every few seconds.<br/><br/>In short - brilliant hardware - crippled by Bezos stupidity.
I think this phone is sexy
Seriously App store. Get. It. Together. Seriously.<br/>I ordered this phone after a drunkin fight with my iPhone. Was it my best decision? Absolutely not. Was it my worst decision? Not quite - I had some really bad fashion moments in the mid 90s. Do I regret my decision? Like a college chick on a post homecoming walk of shame. This phone seems like a great idea. The size is perfect, firefly looks super legit, and it's from Amazon. Amazon. The land of a million products, two day shipping and free prime vids. (Yes I am an Amazon addict) Unfortunately the piece doesn't live up to the hype. First, it really embraces its Fire name. This cookie get HOT HOT HOT! Charging? On FIRE! Playing a game? On FIRE! Trying to find service like 10 feet outside your apartment? ON FI-YAHHHHH!! So yeah - I feel the burn. 24/7. And what about usability? Ummm...the whole swipe around deal is ok. Sometimes. When the phone decides not to freeze. So like 45% of the time. The freezing issue is a pain. And totally uncalled for considering the "Fire" name. Also the whole voice command thing is a disaster. "Call Home" equals Search for "Garden Gnomes." Not quite... The worst is when voice command calls your boss at 3am when all you wanted was to find the nearest pizza place. Fire...d. And then there's the app store. The measly excuse of an app store. No banking apps? Great. No fitness device apps? Perfect. No Google apps? Ummm... No Snapchat? I DRAW THE LINE! My social life has seriously suffered because of this phone. I pretty much miss everything my out of state friends are saying and doing. It's like I live under a rock and that rock is called Amazon. Time out though. The whole free prime for a year deal? Absolutely love it. And a brilliant move on Amazon part. I am proud to admit that at every chance available I justify my purchase of this phone with the inclusion of a year of free prime. So thank you Amazon. Thank you for giving me one small reason to excuse the Everest-ical faults of this phone. Here are two stars. XOXO
The Amazon Fire Phone combines most, but not all, of the things I liked best about my old iPhone, Android phone, and Kindle Fire HDX. The Fire Phone also offers some useful and entertaining features you cannot find on any other phone. Dynamic Perspective works surprisingly well and the Amazon software ecosphere adds a seemingly endless amount of content and valuable services with minimal hassle. I was worried when I started reading so many negative professional reviews, but I honestly think the Fire is tough competition for the Apple, Samsung and HTC flagship phones.<br/><br/>== Display == (5 stars)<br/>My first two smartphones were Apple's iPhone 3G and then the iPhone 4. While I enjoyed them at the time, the 4.7"-5" display found on many Android phones is just so much nicer to use. The Fire has a 4.7" IPS display, which is like my husband's HTC One (M7), but the resolution is only 1280 x 720. The AMOLED display used on the Samsung Galaxy seems to have slightly better contrast, but the colors are so over-saturated that I think the HTC One and Amazon Fire look better overall.<br/><br/>I thought I might hate the less-than-full HD resolution, but I really don't notice it unless I'm watching a high quality full-HD movie by myself. The resolution is higher than any iPhone and matches the Samsung Galaxy 3. The pixel density is still pretty high at 315 ppi. The best thing about the display is how bright it can get. It is the first phone display I have used that is easy to see when it's sunny outside.<br/><br/>== Features == (5 stars)<br/>Dynamic Perspective is the obvious differentiating feature and it really works well. The effect is just like looking into a small window - your field of view and perspective change with the position of the phone relative to your eyes. When I saw the layout of the 4 sensors I thought it might be an issue to hold the phone without covering the sensors so the effect would work. However, it turns out you can cover 1 or 2 of the sensors and the Fire will still track your head. It also uses the internal accelerometer, which I find helps it work seamlessly when you are tilting it in different directions to change the perspective. While it is really cool, there isn't a ton you can do with it...for now. I haven't gotten used to the gesture controls yet, but I think they might need more refinement through a software update. Given how well the technology works visually, I am sure a ton of apps making smart use of Dynamic Perspective will arrive over the next few months.<br/><br/>Firefly is the other innovative feature Amazon is touting for this phone. At first I thought it would be just like some of the apps I have used to take a picture of a product and find it online. Firefly goes much further in the type of content you can access using the Fire's camera. If you show your phone the TV show you are watching, you may be treated to a surprising amount of information on the episode, actors, etc. It's just fun to play around with at first, but I think it will come in handy and help me greatly expand my knowledge of useless things.<br/><br/>The Fire Phone also has all the great features I love from my Kindle Fire HDX. Mayday is really, really helpful if you ever get stuck or something goes wrong on your phone. It isn't all that different from calling technical support on the phone, just better in every way. The introduction video to the phone is a minor, but very helpful feature.<br/><br/>Since everyone who has a Fire Phone will have Amazon Prime for a year, I should mention that Prime Instant Video and Prime Music are both terrific, despite obviously having gaping holes in their content libraries. I think I might try the new Kindle Unlimited just for the audio books. And, Kindle FreeTime is such a treat for my kids on my Kindle Tablet that maybe it'd be in my best interest to keep it off the Fire Phone. Some people don't like being locked into Amazon's world, but for me it is a big positive, just like some people prefer to be locked into Apple's iOS. The Amazon app store has every app I've ever wanted or have used on my Android devices.<br/><br/>== Hardware == (4 Stars)<br/>The internals on the Amazon Fire Phone have their ups and downs. The camera is a big up with 13 megapixels and beautiful performance. Compared to the HTC One (M7 and M8) it is vastly superior and beats out other phone's cameras that I have used. Downs include the small battery (2400 mAh), lack of microSD and last-gen processor (Snapdragon 800). However, none of these seem to matter at all. The battery seems to drain slowly, much slower than the HTC One (M7), though I'm speaking from brief experience. With 64GB of space the lack of microSD is less of an issue. I haven't tried out too many games, but so far I have not noticed any lag at all. Since the resolution is only 1280 x 720, it makes sense that the processor wouldn't need to be as fast as those on the S5 or HTC M8. Speakers that are decent compared to most phones but disappointing compared to the HTC One. The included earbuds work well and don't tangle, as promised.<br/><br/>== Build == (3 Stars)<br/>The Fire Phone is an almost perfect blend between the iPhone 4 (on back) and Kindle Fire HDX (on front). I kind of like the higher end look of the iPhone 5 and especially the HTC One. However, I don't' think it looks bad compared to the Samsung Galaxy. If you are going to use a case, it doesn't really matter anyway.<br/><br/>The size is a bit smaller than the Galaxy and HTC One, though marginally thicker than the Galaxy. It is bigger than the iPhone obviously. It is also a bit heavy like the HTC One, which is surprising since it is smaller and doesn't have all that metal, but it is still comfortable to use. The smaller size helps a lot using it one handed, which I do a lot. There is a hardware button for home, which I like better than the software button for home on the HDX.<br/><br/>== Overall == (5 stars, assuming you remain a Prime member after 1 year)<br/>On paper, the Amazon Fire Phone has some big strengths and weaknesses. Using the phone however, I don't really notice any weaknesses. The phone does lack a high-end/flagship look and feel, but that is easily compensated for with the right case. Also, it does get hot sometimes, but not as hot as the HTC One (M7).<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who is an Amazon Prime member or frequent Amazon shopper. It is also the only Android phone I would recommend to my parents. I do expect the software and apps for this phone to improve noticeably over the next few months. This is a great Phone as it is, but has a lot of unique advantages that currently have more potential than practical benefit. The pricing is higher than what I was hoping for, but after you factor in the free year of Prime, unlimited cloud storage, 1000 amazon coins and the 32GB base memory, it is an attractive value.
No privacy with this phone no back button  good os  nice pics easy to use app store needs more options
My order of the Amazon Fire Phone arrived on time and in perfect condition. This is the first phone that I have ever owned and I absolutely love it<br/> It is all I could wish for and even more. If I could give it 10 stars I would.
Not as good as an android or Apple  phone. It's quick and has great colors but not so user friendly.
This was my first phone in several years, and I had no idea how to use it. The support was wonderful and they took me through every step. I love the phone so far, but have nothing to compare it to. I would recommend it to anyone.
I just got the phone yesterday it seems to be pretty cool. I was frustrated at first. I was so used to my Blackberry torch (an underrated phone) Ive had it so long and it was very easy to use the icons we right there. I'm starting to figure out how to navigate this phone. It seems to be wearing out the battery quickly but then again Im constantly trying to figure stuff out. i used the help button and i got a live person quickly to help guide me through some stuff as there is not a paper manual supplied.I have changed the hibernate screen to my own picture but no wallpaper is available in the photos (that Ive found)to make it feel like its really yours The screen and graphics are super clear and super cool. The fact that the phone is watching you as you lean in any direction is a little creepy but the 3d graphics are way cool. So in my second day of owning this phone I'm  pretty happy . I'll check back in a week
Love my Kindle e-reader. The Fire Phone? Umm... not even close.<br/><br/>It took a couple days to accept the fact that the Fire Phone is such a step backwards in the smartphone world. Somehow I thought it would be the breakthrough device Amazon promised. And why not? Whether you like the company's business practices or not, they basically invented and perfected the e-reader market. The company seemed to have huge potential to knock another product category out of the park.<br/><br/>Sadly, Fire Phone is a disaster. It is slow and unresponsive. The screen refreshes are like a drunk stuttering person dancing on a hot sidewalk. It sucks battery power and I'm already seeing a decline in daily battery life, after just a couple weeks.<br/><br/>I had an iPhone and loved it, but wanted to try Android. Fire Phone is a bit of a twist on other Android phones. But not in a good way. It is very hard to configure, both settings and layout of applications.<br/><br/>Every couple days the device decides to reboot itself. Not sure why this happens but it doesn't give me a good feeling... Some of my calls are for business and I'd hate to get interrupted when talking to a customer.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend not purchasing this phone.
I have a lot of problems with people hearing me without the provided headphones. I don't have a case on it so I know that isn't the issue. I call Mayday and they did a reset which did nothing. Next step return it to the store.
Fantastic! I love the opening screens. They've done a lot of things right. Easy to get my pictures onto my computer. I wish it supported all of the android apps though.
The phone itself it real nice.  The fit and finish are top notch.  If only they could just run all normal ANDROID apps.  Instead you need to only select from a smaller subset of Fire APPs.  So what's missing?  A lot.  Some of the APPS that are there are older versions since they have to modify them.  No Dunkin' Donuts APP, no Smart Glass APP, no SiriusXM APP, you get the picture.
I like the phone. I don't feel it is user friendly.  I also have a Samsung Galaxy 5. The fire is no way close yet. It has some nice features,  but I really wouldn't use them much. If you like online shopping its great.
Kind of upset about the app store not having a lot of the apps that Google okay or Apple have.but over that it's a great phone. I have also had some signal issues with my calls that I never had before with my Samsung.
I was really excited when this 1st came out. There were many apps that were not available, but I was patient. I kept hoping that in time that would change, but I've had it for over a year now and can't use it even with a common Bank of America app. I'm very disappointed and am counting the days until i can go back to a phone with an operating system that isn't as limiting.
The phone is OK. AT&T; mobile is CRAP! The reception is poor if it all, when I'm away from home. I should get a refund of $198, being they are offering the phone with same plan for .99 now. I paid the $199 price. The phone itself is like a small Kindle Fire HD tablet which is what I started out with in 2013. So the navigation is no problem to me, and all the apps work well.
the best phone, not complicated, easy to use, and I love my monkey app
Awesome and none better
Is this a prepaid phone
I think the fire phone is great. Its customized android os is unique, the peek option is nice as well as the twist option to view the side panels. The camera is amazing, and the one hand operation is sweet too..
i would have gave it five stars but the speakers suck. you cant watch movies with the speakers you have to use headphones same goes for music to. i really wish they would have done a better job on the speakers.
SUITS MY NEEDS BUT.....IT DOES GET HOT, NOT WARM! lUCKILY i AM NOT ON THE PHONE THAT LONG. ALSO, THE BATTERY DOES NOT LAST ANYWHERE NEAR WHAT THEY SAY. YOU CAN WATCH IT COUNT DOWN VERY EASILY. LIKE OWNING A CAR FROM THE 60'S, WATCHING THE GAS GAUGE!<br/>THAT SAID EVERYTHING ELSE I LOV E SO I WILL KEEP IT UNTIL THE IMPROVED VERSION COMES OUT.........
There are good things about this phone and some not so good.  Camera is great.  My biggest disappointment right now is short battery life.  10-12 hours even with just checking emails and messages on it.
Great
Using the android OS and having a removable battery would have netted this phone five stars.  Amazon's OS isn't bad. It's just different and different enough to be a pain when trying to troubleshoot.  But then I'm an old crank who'll stay with Windows 7 on his PC until they pry it from my cold dead hard drive.
Omg I love everything about my cell, the only thing I wish it could do is bring my music from my Google play over (the album's that I bought) other then that it's so simple easy to use.
The phone is ok, nothing special. The video recording sometimes doesn't work so I have to restart my phone, which is annoying. Also the app store doesn't have a lot of the popular apps.
This is the most awesome phone I've owned ! I love the 3D look and I get a new desk top cover every day. It's a little more complicated to use but I'm learning and the more I learn the more impressed I am. WOW ! just isn't enough to say about this phone. If you get one you will be constantly entertained.
i love it but at&t; was killing mr in data you should give people a choice on phone company to connect to ande i couldn't use wi fi cause i live in the mountians, peaks and valleys.
Disappointed that I am unable to use Google apps.<br/>Internet is limited.<br/>Battery will barely last 4 hours if using continuously!<br/>Ringtones-limited choice - my previous phone "BrewMp" was a LG had more ringtones, the calender had better alerts, options for text messages, for example: alert tone, if u wanted to be reminded more than once.<br/>I cannot use Bluetooth with my computer Windows 7.<br/>Issues with You Tube.<br/>I hope Amazon comes up with a solution to make it compatible with Google.<br/>I don't watch movies on a screen this size!  I guess this phone is appropriate for children, like the 2 that advertised on TV.  I don't even see advertisements for this phone anymore!
As an AT&T; customer I leaned towards the new Amazon Fire. After less than 30 days I started experiencing a problem. I could make and receive phone calls but my screen went black and I couldn't get back into the numeric keypad screen without the screen turning black again. I couldn't hang up a phone call before the voicemail kicked on, hence I was stuck on the line until the voicemail box reached its max recording time and hung up on its own. I went through to whole ordeal with customer service and tech support to only reveal that I needed a new phone. It's under warranty so they're going to replace it but it leaves me feeling a bit weary. I like the phone but things like this should not happen.
Great phone.  2 Weeks since purchase...Upgraded from 'budget' wireless service and s***** phone.  Impressed and satisfied.
It's a good phone does what it supposed to do. It's just a phone nothing fancy it could use some upgrades like better speakers and better look but for the money great phone
Thus phone is amazing. So many cool features like 3D screen, one touch Firefly (which I adore and use daily) and of course my Amazon Prime! I miss some off the tweaks of my S3 our even my 4S but this phone is still brand new so I'm sure I will discover more as I go! Good job, Amazon!
I played with it in the store and loved the navigation.  The screen is clear and absolutely beautiful.  The only reason why I didn't go with it was because the clerk recommended another phone for a heavy camera user.  Maybe next time if they work on the photo aspects of their phone.
I was a little indecisive about this phone, but I love this phone and the costumer service it's great, I was amazed at the quality of this unit, great product, work great
I would buy this product in a second if you put the Google app store on it.  Amazon does a lot of great things, however the amazon app store is horrible.  I think amazon is really missing the boat on this one.  They could be king of android, but not without the google app store.
The Anti-Google stance is a big drawback ... selection of Apps is painfully limited.  Dynamic Perspective is nice ... but ... very few instances where it is used/useful.
So far the best feature is the dynamic perspective screen saver. I don't really like being locked down to use Amazon approved apps from their app store, as there are several apps that are not available. I do like the cloud server, and it's pretty cool that it automatically detected my Fire TV, but I'm very sad to say I'm not impressed overall. I love Amazon, I use them for most everything. My screen has also locked up once, and the power button being held down for 1 min was the only way to get it to turn off. The restart button shows on the screen which wasn't working.<br/><br/>I'll consider the Fire 2 if it ever comes out, but I'm returning mine today.
It’s time to put out the Fire! It makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud is not a strong selling point, especially when competitors like Apple are using 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon can commit to using modern, clean energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.
still getting the hang of the phone but very sleek and user friendly
Wasn't sure I would love this phone after having an iphone from the beginning. A few tweaks and this will be a 5 star phone. I know they are working on things and Amazon's customer service is the best there is. No doubt this phone will be a rock star in no time!
I just got it so it is hard to give it a good review.  I am still learning the phone. How to use it and all.  I am a slow learner when it comes to electroninc's.
Very dissatisfied
I've only had this phone for a few hours, but I've not had any issues with it whatsoever. In truth, it appears to me to have improved on several of the ideas presented by Android and Apple, but I would be hesitant to suggest this to someone who isn't inclined to play around with settings and uncover the new techniques presented for swiping and tilting. My only issue stemmed from my upgrade from a iPhone 4S to the fire as the iMessage feature blocked some of my messages from being delivered to the Fire despite the 4S being deactivated. The Mayday associate I spoke to said that this was common for a lot of people swapping from the iPhone, and she was patient enough to explain what I needed to do to my iPhone to correct the issue. (Why Apple hasn't figured out how to shut off iMessage when a customer deactivates their number on a phone, I have no idea.) I'll also respond to some of the previous claims that it runs hot, as I've not had any issue with that at all and I've been running it for several hours.
Love it
After figuring all its features this phone is just awesome! I highly recommend it. The only bad thing is that it does not have a partnership with nike running.
This is the worst purchase I think I have ever bought.  I thought it would connect my kindle and my phone but instead all it did was give me a big headache. I would love to go back in time and not buy it. We can not even hear it when it rings and the volume is all the way up, same thing with texts. It just really was a bad idea and purchase. Well all I needed was some more time thanks to my son this phone has become a-lot better I am finally figuring out how to get around this phone. Still rough but getting there so if you have patience this is a fun phone but the time for web is way to short but it works for me
The Fire could be MUCH better.I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.
The Amazon fire phone has many things to like about it: its incredibly clear and bright screen, its speed, clarity of tone and light weight. As I was "the first on the block" to get the phone there were a few issues to address which have mostly been taken care of: i.e.  the battery life and an odd beeping noise. I am finding that learning the phone is more like learning windows 8 than learning a phone. A few things still need to be addressed- font size in text messages and some favorite apps like mapmywalk which are not available yet for this device. I would compare it favorably with the iphone .
I have purchased a Amazon Fire Phone and I do not want to use use ATT as a cell phone provider. How can I get the phone unlocked so I can use another cell phone provider. Seems there are customers who elect not to use ATT service<br/><br/>Bobby Doyle
This phone is not ready for prime time it lacks a lot of features to easily migrate existing data. The camera button is to easy to turn-on and need to be a soft button. Tech support at Amazon were not familiar with the MAC OS even at the expert level.
2 comments: Camera button pushed by mistake due to too accessible relative to the volume button; ear phone connection not consistently transmitting sound.
Had this phone less than a week when I knew I had made a mistake. Returned & went back to the IPhone.
Got this phone from the AT&T; store.  I really wanted to like the phone, I am glad AT&T; had a return policy.<br/><br/>The good news about Android is that it does not tie you down to one app publisher... Unless you are Amazon who used Android for their operating system.  I felt like this was an Apple phone.<br/><br/>The display has a fairly poor image at only 315 PPi, this is not up to standards, the only current smart device worse than the amazon phone is the Apple S5 at 421PPi, and I think that phone is a year behind the Amazon phone.<br/><br/>The perspective change is pretty cool for the first couple of looks and then looses it's charm due to the fact that there are only very few apps that can use the perspective change on the device.<br/><br/>Not dust or water resistant.<br/><br/>I really like the dedicated photo button and the fact that your pictures and videos get uploaded to the Amazon cloud automatically.
I got this phone based off the ads on tv and the Prime that comes with it. It is a nice phone and gets the job done but I wish it had more apps, like my banking app which I use daily. I also bought this on the AT&T; Next plan and am paying $30/mo for it and now the phone is only $.99!! So I am paying over $600 for this phone in payments when I could have purchased it for $.99 had I known it was going to go down in price! This has made me not want this phone or the Prime anymore since what I am paying for the phone monthly, I could've paid for the Prime membership over six times!
Love
okay
I have had my phone for almost a year and have yet to have any issues that mayday could not help me with. This is the best smart I have ever owned.
Tried to hard. It's to complicated, I've had it a couple weeks and still can't figure most things out. The head set that came with it is on point.
So many features to fix..... neither quite set up for the programmers who love their Kindles and were hoping for the next morph towards a real computer which happens to make phone calls......nor set up for the stupid folks who will buy a fancy phone and only learn to text and cheat in school.<br/>What a positive progression!!<br/>I'll buy the Fire 4 or 5, but will put up with the lack of ease from the first model for now.... still almost better than my last Samsung.<br/>Actual memory and use of real programs make this my favorite mobile computer so far....
I previously had IPhones and Android based phones before purchasing this phone. Though the year free subscription to Amazon Prime is great, it doesn't make up for all the things this phone is lacking. The phone doesn't support a large variety of apps and the touch screen doesn't work that well. Furthermore the battery life stinks and doesn't last long at all. If I am lucky the battery last half a day. If I could go back I would never have purchased this phone. Unfortunately I am stuck with this phone for two more years or until I can purchase a new one.
The phone is good, camera is awesome, dynamic perspective is cool. The only recommendation would be a more steady OS with many features and apps
Must have phone
the screen should allow people to make the print larger for people who are vision impaired<br/>like the kindle tablets did for easier viewing
I love my phone.. only thing keeping it from being 5 stars is the fact that some apps are not available for it. But I can do without them. :)
Garbage phone that I am still stuck paying for. I wanted to love this one as I did my kindle. But it turned out to be the worst rhing I ever purchased. The apps stink. You cannot get half rhe ones you can get with any other phone. My keyboard stopped working so I jad to do a hard reset. Backed up everything and alas still lost everything. Mauday was NO help. She didnt know anything about this phone. I am hoping the pulled it off market and do not even try to bring it back. I should have gotten the Iphone 6 or Samsung 5.
While I liked the fact that it was large so I could see what I was doing....it was also heavy and thick.  Plus, I couldn't get the much publicized features to work on my phone.  I bet I spent 10 hours the first week speaking with the (very nice) young man in support.  At the end of the day, for the price, it was just too complicated and cumbersome for me and I returned it.  I will say that I had no problem getting Amazon to accept the return and I was credited in full.  Shame the phone wasn't as awesome as the company.
CAN NOT GET MY WALKING APP THAT I LIKE, CAN NOT GET MY BANKING APP  OR FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE RINGTONES EVEN AFTER DOWNLOWDING THE APP
I thought that I was getting 64gb, plus I got an text mgs saying that I used up some mins,  I thought that I had unlimited everything.
I like the phone but since there are no instructions for it that I can find, it makes it very difficult for me to learn how to use it.
It's an ok phone. Tons of apps yet not the ones I use.
I'm disappointed with the phone. First the AT &T; store didn't know anything about it, but I love my kindle fire so I thought I would love it to. First of all there is no back button so when you are checking email and it sends you to a place to see add one must exit silk and restart email. I have yet to find a way to make ringtones for text louder. Using facebook on here is no good might be the app not sure. Its going to be a long 2 years. Speaker is not loud enough, The phone shuts down sometimes.
I'm still on the wire on this..tried to listen to my music on the device when I didn't have any cell service and it wouldn't work....update. now that I have used awhile longer I am becoming more unhappy with it.if I am out of service range my music won't play because it can't sync with the cloud. Yes, that is for music stored on the phone.. reception is horrible. About half the area I was to get service with my previous phone.a lot of times I can't even send texts..cannot get a lot of apps because Amazon doesn't have the available through their store. Even the Pintrest app they do offer doesn't work correctly. Some cool features,but after getting used to other established OS this has some much needed work. I would even recommend an IPhone before this and I hate IPhones.....and now that Prime has run out this phone is an absolute piece of junk.. I can hardly ever get it to work now.
Give us something like you always do. A cheap, yet strong device. Cut the unnessary stuff from Fire Phone and we will have a better world of Amazon.<br/>Cut the extra 16 GB(Lets start with a 16 GB version), remove dynamic perspective(we can still retain most of the features using gyroscope) and an ability to download Google maps. This will make the phone lightweight, will improve battery life and can be given at a reduced cost!!<br/><br/>Imagine Amazon launching a Fire Light with access to amazon ecosystem, with an unlocked version at just $349. I'm sure people that is the customers are going to love it.<br/><br/>PS: Dynamic Perspective has 4 camera's in the front. Atleast give us access to the camera to capture the best selfie ever or something like that!
Absolutely love this phone! User friendly and fast.
Does the unlocked phone work with a any DSM sim cards all over the world? I just want to check whether I can use this  in India
Being new to smartphones I find the fire easy to use and sound quality is excellant as well as the it take very good pictures.
I like phone.
Great phone!!
Missing some very important things, like a back button... and some games I have played for years aren't available on Amazon.
The fire phone had a lot of awesome features, but I absolutely don't like the fact that I can't get play!!!  Don't know if it's worth keeping this phone if I can't have my Google play. :-/
love this phone but kind of hard to get used to.
I haven't purchased this yet because I'm still using a new iPhone. I wanted to get into something about this phone before I committed though. I am a huge Kindle user and I am definitely in love with the Kindle ecosystem. However, I have always found the Fire aspect of Kindle unattractive because you short the application in favor of tablet functionalities for things like apps. I have found that the Kindle app was given space for the app and then the storage capacity was too small for the actual ebooks. I am positive that you could do well to give the user more space and possibly some sd card space for ebook storage. The Kindle is awesome and Amazon's claim to fame. Imagine if my reader was also a phone... a dream come true. Your Kindle apps and devices are awesomely known for the reader aspect - mostly. Please consider highlighting and emphasizing the reader portion of this device. It's portable and I can now carry my reader in my pocket. This is always why I opted for the iPhone app rather than the Kindle Fire. Just consider the same aspects for this phone as well. But including all of the cool exclusive features of amazon reader. The phone needs to update well and not have any glitches when it comes down to the ereader portion because the Fire tends to freeze and take days to download ebooks. And remember to keep and enhance the text-to-speach aspect, there's music and then there's text-to-speech. I found that feature to be a lifesaver while I was on the go (even for my bluetooth feature in my car).<br/>  Also please consider highlighting your reader specs and features in the advertisements for the phone. I know plenty of people feel like me about anticipating that feature and hoping it works well but having  to guess at it. The audible, video, and music apps are just as awesome concentrate on the space allotments  for those features as well.
To start off I have to say I tend to be an early adopter of new technology which makes me more tolerate of issues.<br/><br/>So far I like the phone and have no regrets getting it.<br/><br/>Likes:<br/>1. Dynamic Perspective is pretty cool and I do really enjoy it with the few games I have downloaded.  I will like it more when a map app developer creates and map app that uses it.  I did just discover the lenticular camera setting that lets me take my own pictures for dynamic perspective so will be playing with that for awhile.<br/>2. I like being able to turn the camera on and use it without unlocking my phone.  I also like I can do this with Firefly.  I have taken a few pictures by mistake thinking I was in Firefly - but no harm as I just deleted them.  Firefly itself is only identifying some of the objects - but I expect this will improve and will come in the form of software upgrade.<br/>3.  I like the overall look and feel of the phone.  It did take me awhile to get use to the "peek" where I have to tilt the phone slightly to see battery strength, connection strength etc.<br/><br/>Dislikes:<br/>Like I said above, I am pretty tolerant of issues on new technology so none of these trouble me too much.<br/>1.  Prime Music App - the volume is very inconsistent.  One song will be so low I can barely hear it and the next will nearly blow my eardrums out.  I really don't want to have to adjust the volume manually for every song!  The first few days this was not an issue but now it is.  I am assuming either the problem came with an app upgrade or perhaps I changed some setting without realizing it.  I will be researching this further as it is troublesome.<br/>2.  Battery life - I noticed the battery only ever reaches 99% and not 100%.  No big deal - but it only last about a day before I have to recharge.  I noticed the wifi was taking 21% of my battery so I turned it off to see if it is better.  I figure I can always turn wifi on manually.<br/><br/>That is it for now.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/>I still like my Fire Phone - in fact I like it more every day!  Turning off the wifi and setting screen lockout to 30 seconds has really made a difference in the battery life.  I charged my battery Thursday pm and it is now Sunday pm and I still have 50% power left!  Granted some of the battery savings is I have not gone for my hour runs listening to music the last two days.
To be fair, I purchased the phone from AT&T; and not Amazon.  The phone is not perfect.  Many small issues but a nice phone overall.  Since I am a big Amazon customer and since I read many many books - this phone is great for me.  Would I purchase it again??  I don't know.  I think Amazon/AT&T; would have to wow me with 1. improvements and 2. price.  $200 is expensive when the phone is not perfect.  One problem I'm having with the phone so far is that I can't see the texts.  I've tried so many different things to change the font for texts and have not been able to so far.  Again, to be fair - I haven't checked with Mayday or with AT&T; to find out if I'm missing something.  UPDATE - I lowered my rating on the phone because the text font can't be changed.  I shouldn't have to put on glasses just to read a text.  Sorry Amazon.  I really wanted to love the phone.
Really wanted to like this phone because I am a long time customer of Amazon and they provide great customer service. But, after using this phone a few days it is getting returned. Granted I am used to an iphone but was ready to ditch it. The phone feels big to me. Graphics are great if you're a gamer, my 9 year old loves it! Apps, apps, apps, or should I say lack thereof. No MLB Fantasy Baseball? No MLB At The Ballpark? C'mon. The GMail app is poor and doesn't display properly.<br/><br/>It just doesn't suit my pretty basic needs and ease of use I would give 1 star.<br/><br/>Will give it a couple of years and see what we have then. Disappointed Amazon fan.
Doesn't have latest version of apps, ex..pinterest. The app thing is not a big deal as to so much of the fact that my phone freezes. While scrolling through my pictures, they get stuck in between pictures. Fire phone is a good concept, maybe the second or third edition of fire phone will get more then two stars from me. As of right now that's my rating, for the cost of the phone and the issues that I'm having with it, they don't match up.
Really loved. After using the iPhone for so many years thought would be difficult to get used to the fire phone, but it wasn't the case at all. You can do everything, from closing apps to move to others apps or getting instantaneous information about weather, news, etc, only flicking down up right left. Really recommend it to anyone who wants a handy phone with an awesome camera and automatics backups in Amazon's cloud. Really love it.
I love it!!!
I went to the local AT&T; store in my area to tes out the Amazon Fire Phone.  Now I have been waiting for this phone for some time and was truly excited to get it.  However acter searching through the Amazon Appstore i was very disappointed in the app selection that this phone has the capability to perform with.  Firtsly everyone shoukd have expected no google services since either Amazon or Google simply will not allow it.  I'm leaning more towards Google not allowing them in Amazon's appstore since the Fire OS is a fully custom version of Android.  The hardware and intuituve OS and UI is awesome.  Fire OS 3.5 is very capable however the lack of Bluetooth 4.0 for peripherals is an error I feel Amazon will have to fix very quickly.  Some important apps that are not available in the Amazon Appstore are Dreamsday Countdown, Bitstrips, Poke, RetailMeNot, MapMyRun, MapMyFitness, Myfitness Pal, Yelp, local news stations etc...Remeber there are no official Google Apps in the Amazon App store either.  I understand that quality over quantity is the normal when producing products but the lack of such neccessary apps will do no justice to the Fire Phone.  The real difficult part for anyone to actually grasp is when you look for these apps in Amazon, they are available, but when you select "download for Appstore" and "purchse" you will be unable to do so since there are no Amazon devices that support them.  If Amazon decides to update the Amazon appstore and get more developers onboard then this will be a great device.  Unitil then the OS is simply cosmetically beautiful but not as effecient as it could be with its hardware.
HAVE NOT HAD PHONE LONG LENGTH OF TIME BUT SO FAR I LOVE IT THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT FEAUTURS YOU GOTTA HAVE IT
Better phone connections than my Blackberry.  May Day offered that Push2TV would work with the Fire.  After many attempts we did watch the entire Star Trek movie on our TV.  If you continue to offer Prime videos please give clear directions on what it takes.  May Day connection dropped twice and finally stated that I would have to put up with loss of signal to the TV, which happened three times during the movie.
Switch from iPhone 4s,exceeded expectations
too hard to use, too many apps I couldn't download for example Bank of America mobile apps would not download
Liking it so far though my battery seemed to go fast-hopefully that won't always be the case. I've been an iphone user since the beginning so this will take some getting used to. Looking forward to loving it as much as I loved iphone.
I really wanted to love this phone. I like all my other Amazon products (i.e., Kindles, etc.) and my Prime account. Got the phone when it first came out. The app thing is disappointing, but now the phone continually freezes up and I have to reboot it all the time. Just yesterday, I lost my "ring". Yep- my sound is gone and now I have to go to customer service to see if it can be fixed. I regret this purchase and now they dropped the price to just about nothing- way to crap on all of your loyal customers Amazon! I love you, but this feels woefully inadequate, and I am no tech-whiz.
Use to be a Amazon fan, but this phone has killed all good feelings about that company. NOTHING works on this joke of a phone, Bluetooth doesn't connect, phone randomly disconnects, there are no useful apps, battery last only few hours, the map feature is a joke, the swipe feature works every second time, and the screen freezes every now and again. One tiny good thing could have been Mayday, but that too is terrible, they can't answer anything and keep you waiting - the poor people working at the help disk most be exhausted by the end of the day -  but sorry, bad or no answers coated in a sweet tone doesn't make it up for good service. Unfortunately I'm stock with the monster the next 12 months unless I just toss it and go back to iPhone
Great phone
I loved this phone when I 1st got it.... I've had it for 4 months now and last month I had to call customer service 3 times to get my speaker working. I could only hear phone conversations while on speaker phone. Now that that issue is taken care of, I've noticed that I can barely hear with the volume turned wide open...so I guess I'm going to contact Amazon support again but if these problems persist I will probably go back to the Galaxy S5 or I might try the S6. Another thing I don't like about this phone is that you can't get the Google Playstore which has alot more to offer than the Amazon App Store
Great phone
It's great!
Very useful
Great phone
didn't even last a year. This phone has so many bugs that I have to reboot the phone about 3 times a day.
I dont like that upwards swipe to go back a page. The keyboard is touchy around the top row and its easy to press a suggested word instead of a letter. The phone gets hot pretty quickly if held frim in the hand or in a case and the media player pause bar during videos is almost always visible and blocks the bottom of the screen. It's a good phone but those little problems need to be adressed.
Sent mine back.  Phone was nice with a few cool tricks. However, and it's a HUGE however, with no Google Play Store the available apps is severely limited. Companies write apps for iOS and Android, not one offs like the Fire.
It has been somewhat difficult to learn the various aspects of the phone, since this is my first Smart Phone, having upgraded from a Blackberry.  I am still having a problem locating some of the screens.  Other than that, I love the phone.  The size is just right and it fits into my hand comfortably.  I will also be able to use my Fire to download my books instead of carrying my Nook.
I love this phone yes there are some flaws for example being extra toasty at times and a short lived battery life....but remember every thing amazon does they continue to improve there products for me if they had Google play on the fire phone this phone would be an epic phone and this is coming from an iPhone user
Love it! Only set back is the battery life, but there are setting you can disable to save on battery energy. Watch CNet video for that information.
Could be better. I'm growing on it!  👌
This thing is terrible and I wish I had never bought it.<br/>I had a GS3 that was >2yrs old and was ready for a change.  I am a huge Amazon customer so all of the negative points about an Amazon phone "locking" you into their ecosystem was perfect for me-I want a direct feed to Prime!  The hardware is fine, but everyday I use it I hate it more-nothing works like it is supposed to.  First-when I was out of the office, I tried to set my auto message for my work Exchange account-the feature was non-existent, in that they didn't port this over to their version of android.  Just today I can't seem to add a contact and ph# to the phone.  I don't know who is in charge of this program but they should be terminated immediately-how does such a crappy product make it out?  I bet Bezos hadn't used the thing prior to his public release of it.<br/>And don't get me started on ATT- when trying to setup the phone I called from my work phone and they couldn't set it up because I had no signal!  This is in the same location where I had full bars with Verizon.  Forget about customer service, there is no question ATT's coverage is much worse.
keyboard freezes. The phone freezes.<br/><br/>Camera quality is amazing. I also enjoy the Prime Instant. But otherwise, I want to return it....
I got my Fire Phone yesterday and I love it. It runs fast and seemlessly. It is beautifully crafted, has a beautiful screen and great sound. Probably my favorite phone I have ever purchased, and I had a Samsung S4 before. Definately reccommend to anyone who wants a powerful yet simple to use phone!!!
Love It but still learning it!!!!!! :D
It's amazing including that it comes with amazon prime I also love the games and dynamic visuals.
Amazon, for the sake of all that is good and sane, I implore you to stop making phones. The disappointment is brutal. If you happen to find one in your possession, poor soul, smash it into pieces and mail the pieces far away. It is a cursed piece of junk that will only anathematize your psyche. The glitches will drive you mad, and soon it will just crash and die all on its own anyway. The only reliable aspect of the Amazon phones are their failure. Be it this model or another; no Fire phones. Never again. DO NOT BUY!
Super cool
Not compatible with aol.com,  otherwise enjoying the phone. First one. All flip one's previously
Remind me of an iPhone with an exception of the Kindle aspect and prime I'm not a fan of iPhones
An Excellent Smartphone and an amazing amount of Fun!
Horrible. Not compatable with any important apps. Not even my bank app. Don't waste your money.
this is one of the best phone i ever own it easy to use  clear to read i like it a lot i will  tell everyone i know about it<br/>cool and sharp . thank you amazon  . getting a fire tablet next.
The Fire phone is amazing!  I love it except it has limited apps and most of my favorites, that I use all the time, are not compatible.
I bought my Kindle Fire Phone from At&t.; The firefly is a real good item to have but the lack of app is very annoying. If you like prime for the books just do Kindle Unlimted program for $10.00 extra fee.<br/><br/>I like Walk my walk, Passport America and the Allstays apps there is no equal on Kindle Fire yet. Don't be fooled there are no equal to many of the iphone apps on kindle fire.<br/><br/>Also, if you use Picasso Pictures it doesn't work with Kindle Fire Phone. Wait to buy this phone for a year or two until the bugs are worked out.<br/><br/>Be very ready to go without your iphone apps<br/>Picasso pictures if you choose this phone at this time<br/>I didn't find an equal for the apps I like the most.<br/><br/>Its very difficult to find the apps that I do have with all the scrolling around to find them. A organizer for the apps would be great<br/><br/>Update:<br/>the gps map systems is bad on kindle fire I haven't found any maps for getting around new cities- I used the mapday app and hope the answers I receive help with the maps. Mayday app is very helpful.<br/>The Kindle Prime Shipping is fast but I like to see what I'm buying before I buy it so its not good for me. I rarely use the music and videos. I'm still struggling with the kindle lending library. How does it work? Its not a phone for a nontechic.
Sorry but I'm not happy with this phone... this phone is not compatible with a lot of the apps I like.. (Zedge, whentowork, and the font size is to small when I text and get text messages I have to find my reading glasses just to read them) I wish I could change the font size.. I guess I'm just a Samsung Galaxy Lover.. Sorry<br/><br/>Thanks
Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. I am upset that one of the Fire’s key features, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, comes with a hidden and harmful cost. Unlike Apple and Google who have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s data centers are powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>Amazon, I've trusted you for years.  You've really let me down.  And to think I almost bought that Fire! :(
I love it. If I had my way the camera button would be moved to the other side of the phone.
Why the Fire is really a misfire. I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.
Excellent smartphone. Great value. Hope the unlocked edition will soon be available again.
I had to do a Warranty swap on my first one, because the banner notifications would get stuck on the top of the screen and even backing out to a home screen or going into a new full-screen app wouldn't clear them. Then, the keyboard began doing a black screen where no keys would show, but you could still ghost-type. Then it didn't even come up with a black keyboard, it began coming up with a white keyboard. This was across any app, not just in Messages or WhatsApp or FB Messenger.<br/><br/>Now, my second one has begun doing the banner freezing issue as well, which is all made worse because the first issue was occuring while I was on the road to Louisiana via MegaBus and could not jump to an AT&T; store in the locale I was in. Then the second one was able to be swapped only at an inconvenient location as I was heading out of Charlotte to NYC and so instead of just letting me switch phone models since that 1st location didn't have what I wanted, I was given the corporate big company line of "that's the policy & procedure and we can't do anything outside of that."<br/><br/>The "New World" of phone service, AT&T;, so far is just like the old.<br/><br/>***Update*** 11/7/14-<br/><br/>New phone does the same thing, went to the AT&T; warranty center near Madison square gardens and was politely advised that it is outside the 14 day warranty,which applies from the date of initial purchase.<br/><br/>Given 1-877-253-3596 to call from their courtesy line in the store. Amazon rep was helpful, even though he couldn't find any info at first in the database,he was able to get tech input and the resolving process.<br/><br/>I was told the fix, which I will detail below, has a 99.9% effective fix rate. Not for me, at least. It reoccurred within 28 hours.<br/><br/>First, ensure you have the most recent update.<br/><br/>1- Settings<br/>2- Device<br/>3- Install system updates<br/>4- Check now<br/>5- If any updates come up, install them then continue with the steps below.<br/><br/>The fix described is as follows:<br/><br/>1- Open settings<br/>2- Open applications<br/>3- Manage applications<br/>4- Filter by all<br/>5- Find the Swype app and open it<br/>6- Clear cache<br/>7- Clear data<br/>8- Force quit<br/>9- Press and hold the power button for 45 seconds. Ignore the multiple times the screen will look like it is rebooting.<br/>10- Start the phone again.<br/><br/>They have synced the data from my phone and I have submitted video and photos of the issue to a tech. I will update this review as we finish getting a correction to this.<br/><br/>As well, the headsets that ship with the phone are all about that bass, but are horrid with an echo on any call or Skype.<br/><br/>A free Kindle or Echo might be in order, at this point, wouldn't you agree?...<br/><br/>*** Update 11/11/2014 ***<br/><br/>First thing- Amazon's Customer service Reps didn't even know their own threshold for receiving attached files. So needless to say none of the first three reps got my emails; instead I have an inbox full of bounced messages.<br/><br/>Their limit is 6.0MB. Yes, MB, not GB, and yes it's even lower than most companies native exchange server restrictions of 25MB.<br/><br/>The supervisor I am working with didn't even know there was a limit of 6.0MB, because he has never had anyone with as many issues as this that needed to send in such a large file.<br/><br/>Or 170MB or crash files.<br/><br/>Yes, I have 170MB of crash files. Then I was asked to separate them out and submit them one by one. I have now sent in 39 separate emails with attached crash logs.<br/><br/>*** I was also told that because of the slew of new products Amazon has out right now, their data analysts/techs who will be reviewing the data might not be able to get to these issues right away, that I'll basically have to sit tight.<br/><br/>With an unworking phone, and no offer to send me a different phone or extend a credit via AT&T; so that I can go get something that works.<br/><br/>*** *** *** Then, I was asked to factory reset my phone. Let me just say, this is now the third time I'll have to download all of my contacts, apps, setup new personalizations, etc. Inside of less than 30 calendar days.<br/><br/>To say that I am a disgruntled customer, would be to state the situation accurately.<br/><br/>I actually do feel entitled to some free Amazon merchandise, unashamedly, for the hoops I have had to jump through for Amazon to get their products working at my expense of not having a working device while I've traveled through Louisiana, Atlanta, Washington D.C., and New York City for the past month.
Fabulous phone. So fast!! Love it.
I played with this for a few weeks and gave it away to a friend.  He played with it for a few weeks and now has given it to someone else for free.  Some of the innovative features are cool, but the best ones should just be shipped as iPhone apps.  In terms of useability for this day and age this phone is lame.  Even the kindle app renders poorly some of my books.  The camera lenticular mode is a gimmick.  Any older iPhone you can get free is better than this.
Let me start by saying I would consider myself an advanced user/techno geek/latest tech trends kinda guy.  So this review is going to approach the Amazon Fire Phone under those conditions.  I am coming from an Apple iPhone 3G, 3GS, 4, 4S, 5, and now 5S user.  I'm completely invested in the Apple AppStore, I have AppleTV, a MacBook Pro Retina, iPad Mini Retina, and my wife and all my family have iPhones of some sort.  So it will take a lot for me to switch from Apple given iMessage, iTunes integration, AppleTV, Find My Friends, and a wealth of apps available to me that either aren't available on the Amazon Android App Store or GooglePlay altogether.<br/><br/>PROS<br/>>  Dynamic Perspective works great!  Everyone in the office and at home looked just like the preview commercial--they were impressed and admitted they didn't see anything quite like it.  The most useful demo was the lock-screen graphic.<br/>>  Firefly Technology I am calling a pro even though many products I tried didn't work--I believe Amazon will grow this to where it needs to be and no one else really has a focus on this technology.<br/>>  Full year of Prime ($99 value)--If you aren't on Prime, you need to me.  Simple as that--its the best subscription value out on the Internet today no questions asked.<br/>>  MayDay--if you are my parents or anyone just not tech-saavy and don't have the boy or girl next door to help you, this is HUGE!  Help is just a tap away and the staff is very helpful and patient.  I don't see how Amazon can do this.<br/>>  13MP camera is not industry-leading but it has a good professionalism to it and f2.0 is nice.  Sharpness was spotty and focus areas tight sometimes.<br/>>  Audio--speakers on top and bottom came out louder than my iPhone but also a bit sharp and not enough mid to low range but no one has this.<br/>>  4.7" screen coming from my 4" iPhone was a bigger improvement than I would have thought.  Apple needs to get on board with this!<br/>>  For $199 on-contract/$649 off-contract 32GB is a value against iPhone--you get more storage space.<br/>>  Other prime benefits:  photo storage in the cloud, more seamless integration to the store and instant video, expected.<br/>>  Uses nano SIM card which made switching between my iPhone and the Fire Phone easy.<br/><br/>CONS<br/>>  Phone is a bit heavy as I prepared myself with many of the professional reviews out there.  I felt it in my pocket just a bit more.<br/>>  My number one CON is the OS, Amazon's Fire OS 3.5.  It is a huge dumbing down of functionality from the settings menu to the carousel, for anyone remotely interested in customizing their phone this is very lacking.  The only thing you can customize is pages of apps.  Admittedly for most simple users this will not be a problem but for me and coming from Apple, it felt elementary.  Basic and simple?  Yes!  But leaving something to be desired.<br/>>  Sure Dynamic Perspective is cool but where can I use it?  Hardly any apps or games use it and only time will tell if it catches on with developers.<br/>>  Fonts and menus seemed unfinished and unrefined, looked like it was rushed.<br/>>  You will find yourself charging during the day if you use all of the features of the phone there is just a lot of processor-intensive stuff going on here.<br/>>  Amazon Android AppStore does offer the most popular apps but if you want something more specific (bluetooth apps for my bike, certain productivity apps, etc.) you need to make sure these apps exist on Amazon's App Store.<br/><br/>If you want a relatively easy-to-use Android smartphone with lots of flexibility removed for simplicity, are already an Amazon Prime member or sold into the Amazon environment, and are interested in some nice to have features, this phone can very well be for you.  For me, I just confirmed after just 2 days of use that I'm too tied to Apple in too many ways.  Its hard to switch these days if you have been invested and I would be interested in what Amazon does in the future.
Awesome phone with minimal problems. Can't wait to see future versions and updates.
Ok, where to start? The features of the firefly app and dynamic prospective are a great idea but to build a product just to showcase that is odd and the phone just falls flat because of that. The operating system even though its android based has a learning curve that is pretty steep and is kinda clunky even after you learn it. It's heavy for it's size and the screen needs to be bigger for what it does. The camera kinda sucks and the apps for the camera (other than firefly) are horrible, and even the ringtones are stupid and annoying and you can't use Zedge to change them cause you can"t download it. I would return this thing but I like the great treatment given to me by Amazon since I got it and I have other phones to use so............. yeah. Amazon I love ya but this is not the phone I was expecting.<br/><br/>Addition......... OK, 10min after I posted the first part of this review I called AT&T; and ultimately replaced the phone. I was going to keep it out of loyalty to Amazon but nope they have to step up their game first. Hell do a colaboration with my other favorite company SAMSUNG, that would be the stuff.
Really disappointed in this phone. So wish I had made a different choice. Wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone.
Junk! Does not support google apps that are a staple to daily life. Amazon has it own apps that are worthless. Now that Amazon has admitted that the Fire Phone was a mistake, there is no hope that apps will be developed. I enabled my phone to accept other apps, still blocked by Amazon. Waste of money!
Great product, wonderful price.  Pre-ordered and delivered as promised. It's going to be love. I can just tell.
I found this phone easy to use. I just wish there were more apps to choose from.
My first smartphone.  Love it!
What a shame! Many companies --and Amazon is one of it-- just care about a huge profit over anything. Even over our own planet's health! Sorry, Amazon! Again: What a shame!
Love it.
Very Nice Phone I love the special features and the free year of Amazon Prime.
I love my fire phone...had an iPhone.  Only thing I would change is more apps.
I'm writing this review as someone coming from using an iPhone 4 and a galaxy tablet.  New phone arrived I'm very nice packaging.  First thought was, this is heavier than my iPhone and it doesn't feel good in the hand.  Charged the phone as instructions say to do.  My first experience with the phone was frustration, couldn't find the apps I'm used to, and I began to question my purchase.  I think it was a horrible decision not to have access to Google play store.  Dynamic perspective was pretty cool on the games and screen but got old really quick.  Firefly wasn't working on my phone, tried it on books, tv, music and got nothing.  Web browsing, especially on the Amazon app, was awful.  Laying in bed trying to browse must throw off the sensors because it would zoom in and out of pictures and move the Web page up or down without me doing anything.  Cannot organize apps in a folder which is also annoying.  The nail in the coffin was when my battery began to overheat.  I was playing a puzzle game that comes with the phone and the battery got so hot that I put my phone down in front of a fan to cool it off.  I gave 2 stars and not 1 because the phone calling quality is superb and download speed is great.  Returned the phone to AT&T; and they charged a $35 restocking fee even though I told them the phone has a bad battety.  Got a galaxy s5 active in exchange and I'm extremely satisfied.
It offers so much, I've barely scratched the surface.<br/>My 10 year old granddaughter loves it though.
I paid FULL PRICE for my Amazon Fire phone to avoid an AT&T; contract.  I thought it would be nice since I am an FBA seller.  WRONG!  I wish I had traded my iPhone up to the larger iPhone 6.  Just days after I was past my return time, Amazon sells the same phone for which  I paid $600ish for 99¢.  I was convinced it would benefit with my FBA, but rather it hindered my business on Amazon. I could not get any of the amazon seller tool apps that I had subscribed to. Not even the ones from Amazon!  Had I not researched on my own to learn how to sideload apps, I still would not be able to get my apps that I need to sell on Amazon.  I called Amazon and asked them if I could get my money back that I paid for the phone and do the two year contract.  They said no.  I told them how miserable I am with this phone and they still offered nothing.  Amazon, what about your customer satisfaction A to Z guarantee?  Whenever I call May Day all they ever tell me to do is restart my phone. (Which I have already done about five times already before I make the call.) I do not like this phone and I regret ever buying it.  Now I am stuck with it.  I will say, I do like the camera and the unlimited cloud storage for my photos taken with it. But right now is a good example of why my fire phone exasperates me.  I can not get this review to send and I have had to start over again twice.
This phone is not ready yet - voice recognition doesn't work; call logs and voice mail must be removed one at a time.  Now I know why they have 24 hour support - it is needed.  All of the apps I have become accustomed to on my iPhone are not available on this phone.  Only the "Silk" browser - VERY limited.  Ringtones gone... iTunes music - gone..... The only good thing I can say is that the Camera works very well.  I already own a good camera - now I need a good phone.  This one is going back....
Good phone, but no google support on amazon's stripped down android OS. I returned it for that reason.
Phone. Needs more fine tuning, limited apps, music, volume not the best...
I like that it's different than anything else out there I have had ios,windows,and Android and I'm really enjoying this phone
I expected to love this phone. I WANTED to love this phone. Instead, I am going to use it simply for the Kindle reading app to replace a very tired iPod --- if I can hold it long enough to read anything; it gets really HOT. The battery life is poor. The primary button at the bottom of the device sticks causing all kinds of havoc. The screens freeze. It reboots on its on in the middle of things. I like the size. Thought the idea of MayDay was great ... although I rarely spoke with anyone knowledgeable; maybe it was still too new and the staff was still learning. Maybe I just got a lemon.
It has many glitches. Keyboard disappears quite often when using it for text. Freezes often.
Have to tap buttons numerous times (not alph)  to get it to register.
Awesome
Perfect
Love it
Love it
While the phone works perfectly, I would like to return it (if not for the time restriction) and I would NEVER recommend this phone to anyone because it comes with it's own Bastardized version of Android OS.  I find out too late that most of the apps written for android phones will NOT work because Amazon apparently thought that they should install their own version of Android that will not play with the rest of the world.  If Amazon wants to change my feelings toward them, they should make the next update make the OS revert to an Android that plays nice with everyone else.
I love this phone so far!
The carousel "hero widget" is amazing!  It previews app content like emails and notes.  Very helpful.  I bought this phone strictly to write apps for but I liked it so much I activated it and gave my iPhone 5 to my daughter.  Since getting this phone, I've almost entirely stopped using my tablets, as well.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of puzzle games.  So the Planet Puzzles game with dynamic perspective was a nice little bonus.
Terrible !!!no one can ever hear me talking ... not a good phone at all ...not satisfied
I want this phone so bad and so disappointed . Then when the year of free prime is over they informed me that I could no longer pay for prime by the<br/>Month anymore I had by it by the year. I'm quitting amazon all together because of it.
I absolutely love it!!! It's a lot to it,but overall a GREAT phone
I was not impressed with the phone. Had some interesting features but really fell short of my expectations. I'd be willing to try Amazon's second or third attempt once all the apps are available, the music player functions correctly, and hopefully they get some arrangement with Google to use their services.
I've never had a smartphone so I am pleased with a lot of the features it offers.  I wish the battery life were a little longer and sometimes I get into a blank screen when swiping the phone, but other than that I am very pleased.
Sadly disappointed.  I have had the phone since it was released and convinced myself to give it some time.  I thought the bugs would get worked out, and that the freezes may be fixed in time.  I was so excited to get this phone because I love everything about Amazon!  Well, let me rephrase that.  I love everything except for their phone.  I purchased two phones the day they were released and dropped $400 on phones that I thought were going to be amazing.  My screen freezes, apps close, and sometimes my screen stays black and I can't answer phone calls.  Good try, but I am very disappointed.  My husband dropped his out of his trucks a few weeks after getting it, and it shattered.  It even had a case on it.  Now we are stuck with paying for a phone that is crushed...kind of like my hopes with the Amazon Fire phone.
The main thing I don't like is there is no choice of fonts or more importantly font size. This thing is tough to read with 60 yr. old eyes, on my S3, no problem, just make the font bigger. For me to like it this has to change.
All around its a great phone. Pleased with it to date.But I am realizing that all this morning my calls and messages from yesterday read "Today" on the right column instead of the actual day "Yesterday". SUP
There just aren't enough of the good apps I want to use that are compatible with this. I cannot wait until my time is up and I can get the iphone 6!! I was very excited about this when it came out but it was a bad decision.
I would not buy this phone if it was $9.99. It's a total disappointment. $650 plus the $56 tax for a ATT contract. Overpriced, complicated and frustrating junk of a tin. Super easy to crack, requires too much searching to find info that is much simplier on the samsung. You will have wished you spent that money on a iphone or samsung. there's nothing special or noticeable about the camera, the firefly has no superiority to shazam, the text wording is small and the main app screen page the font is barely readable. Subpar phone. Totally regret I bought it
Many apps available on other phones aren't on this one. Internet negotiating to me is better on this phone than others. The battery life is pretty good. This phone just isn't compatible with some popular products.
Phone is great to use easy to function until you try to hook it up to a vehicle phone system.  Can't pair to the bluetooth of a toyota vehicle.  I guess this is being fixed but in the meanwhile I'm disappointed.
Lousy app selection due to odd android operating system - will not sync with many wanted and needed apps.<br/>Good camera.
It's okay, a little confusing. Wouldn't buy it again. I am having trouble printing from it to my :-P envy printer, didn't think that would be a problem, and when I download music to it I can't seem to find it.
Audio sub_par, needs tone  or eqalizer, needs expansion slot for sd card
I'm sorry to act this way, but with the few means we dispose, it is the only solution I found to show my concern. It’s time to put out the Fire! It makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud is not a strong selling point. If Amazon can commit to using modern energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.
I loved the look and feel of the phone.  I was happy with it for two days but then discovered I could not download my google app that I paid for and my home security app.  After that, I was in NH at the hospital waiting room and could not call out.  Everyone else in the room had the same service as I did, but they had no problem calling out.  I tried sending a text message that looked like it went, but it was never received.  After the hospital I went to my sisters house and could not get a signal where I was sitting, but if I moved a little I could get a signal.  The other problem is the phone gets very hot.  I am hoping the next generation will have fixed these problems as I did love the phone.
Zero tech support. Expect to be transferred around between departments for hours without talking to someone who could possibly know what you are talking about unless your question has an already made answer in the help section.
Thw battery life is too short  I love many features, but since I am a new smart phone owner.  I am having proble.ms  May day is a wonderful part.  I am not sure if 3 d screen saver eats up battery
Why the Fire is really a misfire. I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.
I love my new phone.  I have had 3 iPhones and before that just small cell phones.  I find it very easy to work, it seems really fast, does not use any more battery than my iPhone 5 did, it has a larger screen than my iPhone and I like that.  I like the fact that it pairs up with my Kindles with emails, calendar, music and movies.  Also books, without having to have an app.  I have found apps that work for me, I am not a big game person but movie, restaurant apps, etc are all there.  I also like the fact that Amazon makes covers for their Kindles and now phone so I do not have to shop everywhere, and their product always seems well make.  The only thing that I have noticed is that it gets quite warm if I am using it for long.  Maybe that can be adjusted, I am pretty sure that Apple has had that problem before.  Thanks Amazon for making such a nice phone!
Didn't Light My Fire ... I think it’s completely unnecessary that many of the Fire's key features, like unlimited cloud photo storage, are supported by Amazon's data centers that are powered by coal and other dirty energy. If Amazon matched competitors like Apple by powering their operations with clean and renewable energy, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.

It’s time to put out the Fire! It makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost.

Great phone!!!  Love it!
I don't know if I'm used to my iPhone or if I just don't like this phone. I love Amazon but I find the amazo fire phone hard to navigate. I don't know if I would try another magazine phone.
just recd,this week still learning, so far I love it.

It is very difficult to find my way through it.  I have never had this much problem with my phones.  I had difficulty just trying to call out because I couldn't get back to the numbered
One of the worst phones I have ever owned. Has a android operating system but can not support google app store. The apps are very limited. This phone is behind the times compared to iPhone and galaxy. If you are thinking of getting the Amazon fire phone think again do your research. If you do your research you will stay with your iPhone or galaxy
great phone does exactly what its supposed to do. Don't even acknowledge bad reviews they are an orchestrated effort to bully amazon by granola munching creeps. look it up its true.
It's ok but the firefly app isn't what I expected.
the battery could last longer and apps are limited
This phone is not user friendly in the least! It is hard to get the touch screen to realize that it has been touched and usually takes several attempts to get it to register a touch. The camera and volume buttons on the side of the phone are constantly being bumped in my pocket and I often miss calls because the ringer volume is turned down and I can't count the number of times that I have taken my phone out of my pocket to find that the camera is on. If it wasn't going to cost me another activation fee of $40, I would go back to my old phone even though it was getting old and not working well.
This phone is the perfect size, and the dynamic perspective is actually useful. I can't wait to see what developers do with it and games. I love this phone. Fire os may be a forked version if android, but it runs smooth like IoS. It's really growing on me
I would like to be able to move apps around. I wish big apps like the target and things like that. Over all I like it just wished it had some of the stuff other phones.
It's like Amazon designed a phone for my needs!
I Love my fire phone! It does everything I want and more.
Firefly is a recognition program. It recognizes things. When you turn it on, and point the camera around the room, little points of light, the fireflies, fly around looking for something they can recognize. Put the Fire phone near something with a bar code, and the happy little fireflies swarm to it, and immediately recognize it. I tried it on a bottle of Gold Bond Medicated Lotion, and it got recognized right away. It even gave me a chance to buy some more lotion on Amazon.<br/><br/>Imagine, you are running out of something, and all you have to do is point your phone at it, touch it, and like magic the item is delivered to you 2 days later. No thinking required. No effort at all. Just a twinkle and a touch, and you get exactly what you want. The future is upon us!<br/><br/>Firefly can also recognize music and movies. How cool is that?<br/><br/>Seriously, this is a very cool program, and the whole phone is very cool. Go get yourself one, and have fun playing with those fireflies.
i want this mobile, how much rupees in india,.
it freezes up at times the only problem i have
I hate that I can't see the time on the phone at all times! It is important for me to know the time at all times and I have to tilt it to get the time? What?
does everything I understood it would do ..... so far!
It's ok. It has potential if they keep making more phones. You can tell it's their first phone. I like it just it could be better and not glitch so much
Tried this briefly during the trial period after first purchasing this phone.  I was really excited about it, and really wanted to love it, but in the end just returned it for an iPhone instead.  Seems like they tried to do too much with the phone but ran out of development time or something to fully test everything out... so in the end you're just left with a phone that could "almost" be everything it was supposedly trying to be, but not quite! "Meh" would be the exact way to describe it...
No Google play? No Problem! (if you just want to findout how to replace google play skip to the second part)<br/><br/>So far I am loving it, this is day 2 with the phone. I ordered it after it went on sale for .99 /w 2 year contract and 1 year free prime! Ok so the reason I haven't given this phone a five star is I just got the phone and am giving myself some time to see. Also the reason I am writing this review so soon is I want to address an issue I was worried about and for some of you that may be thinking of buying but have the same questions I did. Ok so I consider myself a very techy person as I work with computers. At first had my doubts when reading about how you could not load Google play store and download apps. I was afraid this would be another blackberry or hp touchpad (webos) and have limited apps I could use since it uses the preparatory FireOS. I first heard that you could "sideload" apps not available on the amazon apps and I was ok doing this agian I am "tech savvy". The process involved downloading apk and installing them on the phone manually after changing a setting in (Settings=>Applications & Parental Controls=>Prevent non-Amazon app installation=>App Installation=ON). Then you would need to find your specific apk (software) to download and put it in your Box account so you could download it on your phone and then install it. And you can still do that if you want.<br/><br/>However for you non-Tech people there is a God send I found out about that is a replacement of Google play store and works well on the Fire Phone. Before downloading the app I am about to tell you make sure  you have changed the Settings I talked about above. The app is called Aptoide and you will need to visit the website and download it with your fire phones browser. You can just google aptoide and it should be the top link. I hope this helps some of you that have the phone now and others who are looking at buying the phone. Aptoide made this a sweet deal! The phone itself is a great product the only thing I wish that it had a place to add an sdcard. I would also like to warn you that some Google services will not work on the firephone even if you can install it. Google maps for example doesn't work but there is a substitute built into the phone. I did get Google authenticator to work and I am about to read my gmail with the built in email manager the fire phone has. I have also read that Google calendar doesn't work but I haven't tried yet as I do not use it.
I highly recommend the Amazon Fire Phone!!
Do not  forsake the environment for the sake of technology. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.
I like the phone.  My only beef is that I can't use my Square card reader with it, but I can use my iPad for that.  Much nicer than my iPhone 4!
Bent over to pick something up, forgot my fire phone was in my shirt pocket and it fell 3 feet and even with amazon's case, the screen cracked.
The phone is good but I had to replace it twice from the ATT store for the exact same reason. The battery overheated and it burned my mom hand.
I have Consumer Cellular phone service and it works fine so far. Books and Audiobooks work great, game apps also. Need to setup other items.
Bought it for my wife.  Cool at first but the more she has it the worse I feel for her. It's so annoying to use.  Can't wait to replace it.
I just got the phone and even though it is android you can not get apps from Google play. many apps I use to pay bills or connect the people are not available. I can't get my mobile banking, grub hub, social media like snap chat, com ed, my insurance Aetna, or even my Comcast account app to pay bills. and many more it is very limited on apps from amazon only. thinking about returning it and paying restocking fee. I use my phone like a tablet, I am going back to my IPhone
No Google services means very limited app library. Everything else works great. Great battery life after you turn off dynamic perspective.
Works well, but many apps not available.
There are way too many software problems still. I can't download apps, or use the internet, whichis the whole  popoint of a smart phone!
can't install many apps  I used in the past like walmart, AAA, 7-11. Needs to be able to install more android apps than available now,
Great device!! Love fire fly technology
I love love my FIRE PHONE!!!!!!!THANKS
I love my Fire Phone! The dynamic perspective is an interesting thing that I hope becomes more than just a gimmick.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>Excellent smartphone<br/>Lightweight<br/>Slim<br/>Dynamic Perspective<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>Amazon App Store<br/>Sometimes remains silent after I take it off of silent mode<br/>Trouble multitasking<br/><br/>I think this is a great phone and I am looking forward to its future.
I really like the phone but there are a few drawbacks. First, battery life is barely a day's use. Second, my old phone number was supposed to be transferred automatically.  That didn't happen.  It took several phone calls and a trip to an ATT store because the SIM card had the wrong phone number in it.  Finally,  Had an app that ate up a lot data Mb when not in use.  Not a problem on my WiFi only Kindle, big problem on the phone.
Far beyond the future of phones.Customer service is excellent The only downfall is the lack of apps but they're coming soon
I love it with the change of screens
I have been looking forward to this phone for a while.. As the time got closer for the phones release I got a bit nervous about all the negative pre-release reviews from tech sites.. But I found that everyone is just a nay-sayer.<br/><br/>I was one of the first people to buy an iPhone when they launched EXCLUSIVELY on AT&T; network, I remember not having any applications to speak of, and I remember everyone saying that their crack-berry would outlast anything else, and nothing would survive on the market that was like that... Time went by... Apple is not a company I like, but since they were the first to really push this tech I bought into it.. Then I decided to get a Windows 8 Phone by HTC, again another Flagship that had no Applications on the store and I still didn't care.. It's a phone..<br/><br/>I've ALWAYS avoided Android, because I dislike Google so badly it hurts. But since Amazon took a baseline Android OS and customized it, didn't give access to Google Play and so forth I am fine with it.. All Android is, is Linux that they built on. So Amazon took it, put their own stuff on it.. No big deal to me.<br/><br/>Ok! For the proper review portion: I opened the box, it took forever to boot up, and still does.. Whatever no big deal.<br/>I had such an easy time learning my way around this phone, everything was so easily accessible and smooth it blew me away. It did get a bit hot on the screen after playing "Amazing" for a while, and downloading several hundred songs in a couple hours from Spotify (I do sort of miss Audiotica from my Windows 8 Phone) it also warms up while its charging, but again no big deal, it's not terribly HOT, just warm.<br/>There are sooo many applications in the store, I found everything I use. (Fox News, Pandora, Skype, Kindle (of course) Ringtone maker... Uh that's it.. I am pretty minimalist.)<br/><br/>Now about the price.. Do you remember when the iPhone first launched? Yeah? It was the same price, these things do cost something to make ya know.. Like Paychecks, materials, production, ongoing support.. That's not cheap, so as a /company/ they want to make their money back somewhere. So I disregard all those "Waaaah it's soooo expensive" reviews immediately. It's a little piece of technology, and just in case you haven't looked at the market lately, it's not getting cheaper as performance goes up. Now if you're happy with a little e-machine and some Go-Fone thing from Wal-Mart.. Yeah this is expensive. But you get what you pay for.<br/><br/>Well, I guess that's my review for now.
Nice to see some new attempts at the user interface. Shaking and leaning were interesting ideas, but I don't think they work that well. I found shaking it was unreliable; sometimes the menu came up and sometimes not. Leaning the phone while on a map brings up new information, but at that point the screen is facing away from me so it's hard to read that information.<br/><br/>Overall, unimpressive.
Don't have as many apps as iPhone I would like to have some of the apps I used to but other than that I like the phone
I love it....
Can't use Google Play or any other app-store with it, and Amazon's app store is TERRIBLE. Without proper access to apps, the phone is worthless.
Bought it as a gift for my wife, who wanted more data storage (for music) than her iPhone allowed. Very disappointed that we can't use Google apps, and can't even use many of the Amazon apps that might have substituted for the Google apps. Can't place Facebook games on it. Will not buy this phone again or recommend it to anyone. The Galaxy S4 and S5 are far superior. Don't buy this phone if you like non-Fire-specific apps.
Out of the two fire phone's I ordered the first week of Oct. one of them doesn't work, there's loud static on the line so you can't talk on it or make/watch videos and after hours of talking with numerous tech support people because they always say someone will call you back within two days it's still useless, nobody has offered a replacement and I wish I'd never ordered them.
Kind of bummed with the selective amount of apps offered through Amazon. Very few that I wanted to use, needs more selections. Also I am not very happy with the fact that there is not a "back" button, a lot of times I can not back out of what I am in (Facebook pictures for example) and so I have to go and force quit the app to get back to where I wanted to be.
I am completely underwhelmed by Amazon’s first attempt at a smartphone. The Fire is certainly not cutting edge when its key feature, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, is powered by outdated, dirty forms of energy like coal and gas. If other tech companies like Apple and Google can commit to powering their data centers with 100% renewable energy — so can Amazon.
I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS NEW PHONE . I LOVE BEING ABLE TO READ IT AS WELL AS HAVING THE CONVENCE OF A PHONE,
It took a while to get use to it
The Fire could be MUCH better.I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.

Wish there was an app for snap chat. Wish there were more ringtones as well as other vibrating options!
It's awesome but my apps keep freezing and my phone too and it doesn't have some of the apps I want =(
I love my Fire Phone, the graphics are great! It's very easy to use. I'm so glad I decided to get it.
The Fire has great capabilities, however at this stage of my learning curve I feel overwhelmed with trying to master the complexities of the device.  I'm disabled because of a spinal cord injury, which impedes my ability to master the device.  Actually I'm using my Kindle to generate this report, because of the larger keyboard size.g
Fun phone with a great camera!
it's a awesome phone ,all the way around. i love the 3d home page . fits my needs for a smart phone.
The phone is growing on me, but ATT has been the ABSOLUTE WORST company to deal with. I have been over charged twice in two months and they charge $10 of fees every month that are not included in the rate plan and are in addition to the actual gov't fees that every carrier charges. I will never do business with ATT again.
The Esperanto of smartphones.
This is a correction to my earlier post.  I was so mad when I saw the price drop and it never occurred to me that I could call Mayday and receive a price adjustment.  I'm sorry for my earlier post.  I am still in the learning phase with this phone (I had an IPhone before) but am now quite satisfied that Amazon has "stepped up to the plate" so to speak.
Great phone !!! Great price !!!
First smartphone for us. Love it. Easy to use and the price with a year of prime can't be beat!
Uses a lot of data. Fire OS
I bought this phone cash from AT&T; and it was a massive waste. Dynamic perspective is fun for like a day then it gets annoying as all hell. You can't download any other web browser on the phone because the App Store is only Amazon "approved or sponsored" apps. So you can't get Firefox or Google chrome and I say this because their browser is worthless. You can't access certain banking sites. It's just really frustrating. On that subject there aren't many apps that you can download period! You can't even get the legitimate version of YouTube! The next horrible thing about the phone is that it lags.. A LOT! Going from an iPhone to this is definitely a down grade. You can't move about the phone as fast as you can on an iPhone. It's very slow and it's always freezing. Overall it's a miserable phone. I'm extremely disappointed and I missed the 14 day period to return it to AT&T.; I couldn't even sell the thing because no one knows what a fire phone is...
I had hoped it would use a something other than Amazon's tablet interface.  It's just too bad.  Maybe Bezos will come around and see that his walled garden is doomed to grow further than the children's market.  Amazon cannot match Google's reach developer wise nor it's software engineering talent.  If it wants to grow it's user base it needs to open up it's ecosystem and allow everyone in including Google. A new strategy whyould be to go after Google's Nexus line.  It would appeal to many more people than than Kindle.  But back to the phone. That carousel UI is horrible on a phone.  And I would still buy one but no way in hades would I pay $449. I might pay $149 but I have a feeling these are going to end up on woot.com for less than that.  It's sad but I think $79 is really what it's worth.  Yes, I know the components are worth much more than that.  But that user interface is why it sucks so bad. That and the lack of Google services.
This is my phone for life.  This phone does everything the Kindle Fire tablet does and more all in the size of a cell phone.  Amazing operating system with technology that follows the user's eyes.  I can not find one complaint for the phone.  Thank you Amazon or attempting and succeeding in your task.
Love this phone.  So easy to use. So much better than my previous windows based phone.
Nice phone!good quality!!!
Awesome phone. Very easy to use. Had iphones for years but im loving this fire phone.
The Connectivity...when the phone is trying to decide weather to use the WAN connection for Data over the 4G connection gets confused sometimes.  Apps Close down a lot.  I guess the processing power is not the greatest for running multiple apps at the same time.  the Screen is way too small.  Granted coming from using a Samsung Galaxy Mega to this was a Shocker but I had little choice with ATT for Phones of that size.  I do not have the greatest eyesight and it is hard to see the screen.  I bought it thinking that the 1 year free Amazon Prime videos would be perfect for my kids...then got onto Prime and found that there were no real kids shows that were geared to my 4Year olds age group.  they were all either under his age group inn liking or over it.  also there were no real movies...it was mostly tv shows.  Very Disappointed.  But I am now stuck with it.  ~sigh~
no place to add sd card.  Must download most of the apps.  All aps must be download.
LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!
The only likable feature of the phone was the graphics on the home page. The placement of the camera button caused you to take unnecessary photos. It was annoying to access Amazon Music or any other apps that I tended to use regularly. Would not recommend to anyone :(
There is one thing I love about the Fire Phone, I get one year of Amazon Prime for free. The dynamic perspective is okay, but I have to turn it off so often because it gives me a headache. I have to wrestle with the screen to get out of the few apps I do have and my bttery drains very fast. Needless to say I am more than dissappointed in this phone. Unfortunately I am past the AT&T; return/exchange date and I have no way of getting rid of this phone. I'd feel bad selling it to someone else because it fell extremely short of my expectations. The app store is a mess and I can't find any of the old apps I once had. My problem is that I jumped at the first opportunity to get a Fire Phone and now I am stuck with something I don't like until I can find money to replace it. Far from happy with this phone. My LG G2 was better. Heck, even an iPhone would be better.
I made a mistake buying this phone, thought it would be a good one for a first time owner. The tilt feature is hit or miss and the keyboard is very  small and battery life is short. The help line did little to solve answer my questions. What I needed was a dumber smartphone
I love my phone, just wish it had more apps that I used to love from Google play
I'm not very happy about the lack of apps. I was assured before hand that wouldn't be a problem, however, there are big name apps that aren't available. I would not have purchased this phone had I known that the apps I use to run my business were not available.
It has a lot of memory. But it can be slow at times. Doesn't have all the apps.
I honestly don't write reviews, especially not the negative ones. I am also pretty sure that Amazon has put their best effort and resources producing Amazon Fire Phone, but I must have to say this is probably the worst smart phone I have ever got and can't wait till my Next Plan with ATT gets to a point where I can take a reasonable/acceptable loss and move on to a different phone. This is a very very moody phone and drops calls all the time. I have another phone from my work on ATT as well and the signal strength is always much better on that phone as compare to Amazon Fire Phone. I always believed it was unethical to use work phone for personal calls, but I regret to say I had to go against my believe since I can't really trust Fire phone that it will keep the call connected. Sorry Amazon, but this is probably one of the worst product you have made available to public.
Very disappointed. Can't get most of the apps I use the most especially my bank and local news. Not easy to learn how to maneuver around. Definitely wouldn't recommend. Was told it was similar to android but there are several differences.
awesome
love it
Just needs google apps
Perfect phone l like ,
Perfect fit case very happy with the design And quality of the product
I'm reading the reviews...not getting a confident feeling...My LG L90 has similar specs...cost me $120...and everything works as it should...Amazon should cut out the proprietor stuff and give customers what they want....
Best phone I've used!
Pros. Nice size screen, comes with amazon prime features like music and ability to stream movie/tv shows. Functionality is pretty easy and compares to others. Camera take good quality pictures.<br/><br/>Cons. Apps, or lack of Apps. If you like to use your smartphone like a smartphone and download applications don't buy this phone. I am not sure what Amazon is thinking but if your phone runs off of Android you better either get google play or get your butt in gear and make sure your customer base has access to all the apps on your app store.<br/><br/>I do have hopes tha amazon will pull their head out of their you know where and get working on this HUGE annoyance and get me my apps darn it!
I would have bought this phone had it not been for the exclusive At&T; tie up. At&T; is terrible with its plans. I would think about buying the next gen Firephone as long as there is an option for independent GSM card
This is my first smart phone and I have a million and one questions. I know I can push the mayday button a million and one times, however, I would prefer a manual to not only show one WHAT the phone can do but actually HOW to do it.<br/>One mayday rep told me that such a book would be over 500 pages. Great! WHY not write it?  I would much rather use an index, glossary, table of contents, etc., to learn about all of the things I could do with this phone and how to operate it.<br/>There are two books and one pdf file on line. All tell you WHAT the phone can do but not HOW to do it. This is EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING.<br/>MG
Was awesome at first.... I got it in September and it's been 4 months and I can't get my charger to hold a charge... I'm flat out not happy with this purchase. For the money I spent. It's junk....
went from an Iphone to this phone. I could not get some apps, Some apps outdated. camera button on side very inconvenient kept taking pictures by accident. I returned it and went back to my IPhone
Absolutely love it.
I have deleted my previous review and am now editing it.  My original review was bad.  Same amount of stars but basically I just pointed out the most glaring hardware problems. After I posted it I started getting calls from Amazon offering to try to fix my device.  I ignored these calls because I, being a tech savvy person, knew that the issues with this device were not just hardware problems.  They were development issues.  You see, it has become glaringly obvious to me that Amazon rushed this phone out.  Spending little time going over common details and developing a tried and true SMARTphone.  For instance, Attempting to watch any video online is problematic if not impossible.  Click on any video with a mobile play option and it will either freeze or just not play at all.  Go to YouTube and you will discover that videos, if at all playable, will not expand to full screen mode under any circumstances.  These are just some of the series of issues.  Search for something online and like most engines, you will get results.  Except in the case of the Silk Browser, only ad and sponsored results will show. No informational results will show close enough to the top to keep you interested. Try to switch between tabs and you will find the screen suddenly zooming in, gaining a blue highlighted circle around it and freezing there, leaving you with only the option of closing the browser and starting over. This is supposed to be a cool option to allow users to quickly capture and send content but it doesn't function at all as intended. That is just the beginning of the screen problems.  Try to end a phone call and you have to hit end call over and over before it finally ends the call 30 seconds later.  The funniest screen issue was the time I took the Amazon Fire customer online survey itself.  I would finish a survey page and click on next and it would randomly change my selections in the survey but would, under no circumstances allow me to make the next icon register.  Only when I turned the phone sideways and changed the page orientation was I able to get it to register.  Even then it took a dozen touches and retouches.  Try to type a long paragraph entry in say, this very review, and the screen constantly reorients itself to a position where you can no longer see what you are typing. God forbid you should have to go back and add or correct something! Tap the paragraph area and you will spend 30 second moving all the text around trying to find where you were. Then trying to reorient the screen will leave you dizzy and frustrated.  Another example is the Amazon App store.  Trying to find a common household app will leave you frustrated because they aren't there.  The common ones like Angry Birds that are there, do not function properly.<br/><br/>I could go on and on, listing detail after detail.  It's almost like Amazon is laughing at us.  This phone sucks so bad that I think they put together a bunch of readily available components, built a ridiculously proprietary operating system and teased it 3 days later.  It's only good enough, with its gimmicky firefly and mayday to survive an in store trial.  My expectation is that someone will start a class action suit against Amazon for charging $700 for this piece of junk and I might get my money back.
missing lots of apps used daily great phone other wise
I LOVE THE PHONE.
So much has been said already that I mostly emulate. Throwing my two cents in the pot too with most frequent gripes.  Also note I'm not an avid smartphone user that utilizes a ton of apps, gaming, etc.  So I have a low bar already...just give me some decent pics, browsing, a few apps, and phone/text/e-mail. I should be an easy one to win over.  Not so much with this phone.<br/><br/>1. The camera, while in spec, seems great it unfortunately fails to consistently deliver. It takes way too long to focus and then finally take the picture that more often than not the photo opp is missed. Videos are often trying to refocus so miss those as well.  I don't get as much use as I would have expected and is among the most frustrating features to try to consistently use.<br/>2. Lack of apps. Like I said...I barely use any apps, the basic stuff here.  Aside from Facebook and Amazon there is little to download and unfortunately the Amazon app store doesn't have much. No one is making apps for this so you're pretty well out of luck in trying to emulate anything you would have downloaded in a prior phone from google or apple app stores. And I miss facetime.<br/>3. The browser does some funky stuff sometimes.  I can have anywhere from 2-6 tabs open for things I don't finish, but when re-opening the browser after a break the tabs will revert to something I closed and lose what I was actually looking at last. It's constant and thus aggravating.<br/>4. I don't seem to have the same battery life woes as others (again, I hardly have anything on the phone), but do have the problems of the phone getting seemingly overheated and occasionally just freezes or shuts down.<br/>5. Voice command is way below the bar of Siri. Most often I get the response "I can't do that yet", even for simple things like directions.<br/>6. Auto-scroll and zoom ended up being very annoying.  I turned off the scrolling feature as it wouldn't work when I wanted it to and didn't stop when I didn't want it. The zoom feature when shopping (something I do daily at the 'zon) is irritating as well. Even the slightest tilt will cause the main image on a detail page to pop up and it's not graceful to get it to go back so you can keep reading or look at other images. Clearly this phone was made for shopping, but even that experience is more troublesome on this phone.<br/><br/>So for someone with a low bar even I want to throw this thing over a cliff.  It's surprising to hear me say I hate a phone as these are typically things I don't care that much about.  Cannot wait to get rid of it.
This will not be a technical review of the phone and features.  #1 - that is not my area of expertise #2 - I have had the phone only a month.  #3  - you can find those a lot of places.  There are some cool features.  The dynamic perspective is neat, but not sure it makes the phone.  I have yet to actually get firefly to lock onto something and work as it should.  I like the look and feel of the device.  Using it as a phone, to make calls, I have had no issues.  No dropped connection and crystal clear.  Taking pictures is easy and they come out decent.<br/>So far, I will say I feel mixed personally due to experiences.  I had to get AT&T; as carrier because they are the sole provider for this device (unless you shell out a lot up front to get the phone unlocked).  AT&T; Crappy customer service and expensive.  I set up a new att.net email address since I was a now a customer (powered by Yahoo - so it is really a yahoo email?)  Despite hours troubleshooting. with both Amazon and AT&T; customer service, I cannot get the email app on the phone to sync the att.net email and set it as my default email.  I also was not able to port my Magic Jack home voip phone number over (although that may be more of a MJ issue than AT&T; or Amazon).  My hope was to be rid of Magic Jack (but not have to change my phone number everywhere) close my other emails and only have one phone number and one email to simplify my life.  Due to this, I can't accomplish that.  I am putting in the right information and settings to sync the email account but it just won't accept it.  Finally the last rep I spoke with said it probably just isn't compatible.  AT&T; is your sole carrier, why wouldn't it be compatible?  The other features, apps and silk browser work appropriately and I have not experienced any real issues.  You are probably alrealdy aware, that although the Fire phone is like android, there are android apps and things that simply do not work on the Fire device.  A biggie is no google play and you are unable to get apps from there.  Only the Amazon app store.  It does seem we purchasers of this are beta testers in reality.  The other day I was entering a lot of contacts and the battery seemed to drain quickly.  I think if this is a good "starter" smart phone - that is your first one if you haven't had one before.  Which is my situation.  Hey, I did get another year of Prime free, so that basically pays me back for the phone itself.  I probably would not get another Fire phone, even if Amazon comes out with a new generation down the line.
After 7 years of being a devoted iPhone user, I'm totally hooked on my fire phone after less than 24 hours! Easy To use fun to play with. Love love love it!
Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. I am upset that one of the Fire’s key features, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, comes with a hidden and harmful cost. Unlike Apple and Google who have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s data centers are powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary.
I'm so irritated at this awful phone that as soon as my prime expires I'm dumping it and everything Amazon. I love my Kindle, I love Prime. I loved everything Amazon until this phone came out. Now they sicken me. They should be ashamed. I'd say wait until the second gen comes out and maybe it'll be better, but who am I kidding, this is such a failure there will be no second gen.
Can't download app's and attachments on this device.
I am very disappointed with the phone I had a galaxy note 3 and all my apps I had is gone if I would to do it over I would not get this phone guess I am stuck now
Still learning, Short battery life, Lots of storage
I luv this phone
You could reduce the price to "we'll give you $100" and it would still not be a deal.  Why?  Limited apps, and PURPOSELY no Google apps or Play access.  That makes the phone much less useful for anyone who makes use of lots of apps.<br/><br/>Why would Amazon do such a thing?  In the words of someone who's at Amazon in their Fire division:  "Does it help sell Amazon goods or services?"  Think about that before you buy.
Ringer isn't loud enough and it is very sensitive
Had high hopes for the phone and it does work fairly good just a lot of little issues. First their app store is lacking most common apps are not part of their app store. The phone does not act the same way every time.  I push the home button and sometimes it takes me to the lock screen and other times I have to push it multiple and it's a toss up wether or not it will load up or not. Once a day the phone will become too slow to use and needs to be rebooted which is not a quick process so if you really need it then too bad for you. I have a kindle fire that I love and hoped the phone would be more like that. If it was I could overlook the app store and be fine side loading the other Android apps but combined with th all the other issues I can't be happy. It may get better I guess I'll see since I am pretty much stuck with it till I can upgrade again. It also pisses me off to see them drop the price so low so quick after they found out it's not going to go over well.  That was pretty much a big middle finger to those who bought it early saying I know we sold you sold you a bunch of issues and instead of fixing it we are just going to focus on dumping the line instead of fixing it and making those who bought it happy so they would review it better. So bottom line if you like having half the apps, only offered cheap cases, not being able to actually control your settings,and being surprised by how your phone reacts every time you touch it then it's the phone for you.
I has a lot of features that's so much better than the other phones. But I had to restart it every now and then because ir gets very laggy when I dont.
I really like this phone, worth ever Penney! 4\5
I don't like that I can't download songs on to it even though it's supposed to be Android based if I had the chance I would NOT have gotten this phone
I'm a little disappointed with the Fire Phone a lot of the apps that I used on a daily basis just aren't available with this phone. The Kindle app on my iPhone kept my place and opened right back up to where I was in the current book I was reading, on this Fire Phone I have to go through my books to find the one I was reading and open it back up. So I've lost a lot of my "convenience" hopefully future patches will make this more user friendly but so far I still carry my iPhone as backup.
This is awesome
Needs more apps
Pro's: free Amazon Prime for a year, just got upgraded for another year! The mayday button and great customer service!<br/><br/>Cons: Everything?  Batterylife, Android system made into their own weird version of something that has to be restarted constantly, any apps that were available before on apple store or google play forget them you won't find them here.  I bought my phone through At&t;, I thought I'd give it a try, and once I finally decided I'd had enough they told me I was one day over the return date. Seriously?  Amazon is telling me I have a busted phone and sending out a new one.  Bluetooth sound quality is horrible unless I restart my phone before connecting,( no I haven't been using it all day it's just been on), oh and I just have to restart my phone randomly just because it stops working and it freezes.<br/><br/>Welcome to being a beta tester, if they wanted early adopters to be happy, they should have tested the phone just a little more before release, and figured out Google Play's proprietary issues.
I love Amazon, I spend entirely too much money on this website so I was very excited when amazon had a phone coming out. I played with it a bit in the store but I admit I should've done more research. Now I'm stuck with it and really dislike it. There is no back button, you have to swipe up to get out of the current screen. If you are in a text message screen, want to go back to the list of text messages and if you use swype; it is a problem. If you don't swipe exactly right, you end up typing a word instead of getting out of the text message therefore adding another step. My most popular word is "bhai"...because that makes complete sense. (Sarcasm) its annoying always but especially when you're in a hurry or already frustrated. Also, make sure to take off the auto correct. I can't tell you how many texts I  sent beforehand that made no sense. Recently, I've been having problems with the alarm on my phone not sounding. That is a problem because I use it as an alarm clock for work. I called at&t; and they know nothing about this phone. They transferred me to an Amazon representative (in which I've always received great service from in the past). I told the representative my problem and they insisted I give them my phone number so they could call me back after they researched my problem in 30 mins. I never got a phone call back, only an email citing that I should restart my phone. Now im stuck with a phone for 2 years that aggravates me daily. I suggest you play with this phone and research it before getting stuck.
I find it too difficult to use, no instructions does not flow well from one use to another, I'm not sure I'm going to be happy that I bought it.
OKAY, note, if you buy this phone and you hate it (which I think you will!) you can't return it to amazon without A. buying a new phone at full value, that's 5-6 hundred dollars, until they refund your money after they get the fire back OR you go a few days without a cell phone. Just be prepared. Have that 500-600 dollars ready to sit in limbo for a couple of weeks. Don't worry. I don't need to like eat or anything. It's cool. Thanks, Amazon.<br/><br/>The phone's camera is excellent. But only get this phone if you only need to use your phone for about 15 minutes a day. It will die. True, there are ways to conserve battery life. If you want to turn off the brightness of your phone, your data, and your wifi, and every other feature the phone has. But if you'd like the keyboard to show up when it's supposed to, or the phone to tell you when you have a voicemail, this is not the phone for you. I'm a tech savvy 21 year old. I know how to use a cell phone. This phone is a prototype. They don't even have words like "schedule" in the dictionary on here. Autocorrect will change it into a different word. The phone has some good ideas- but the execution is a catastrophe.
Its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost. The Fire’s reliance on DIRTY ENERGY LIKE COAL & GAS to power its cloud is not a strong selling point, especially when competitors like Apple are using 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon can commit to using modern energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.
I wish there was an instruction booklet to help me learn the features.  I miss my old smart phone, and I'm not happy with having to use AT&T.;
I bought this phone after having an iPhone 5c. I liked the graphics on this phone and the fact that it came with Amazon Prime for one year. It took a little while to figure everything out. The only main issue I have with this phone, is that I can't get most of the apps I had on my iPhone. Had I known that, I never would have bought it. I think this phone would be good for someone who hasn't ever had a smart phone before. That way you don't know what your missing.
ii whish oneeo
Very satisfied
This is a comment not so much on the phone itself but on the ecosystem.  I have has the phone for 4 months and overall, it is a very user friendly phone.  My main issue from day one has been the lack of apps that are available through the Amazon android offering.  This has been a frustration but having an Ipad, I could usually work around apps that I could not get on my Fire.<br/><br/>This past week, I had an experience which really woke me up to an issue that makes me question whether the phone is viable at all.  I use Uber quite a lot and in places where there is no yellow cab service, it has been a lifesaver.  On the 7th of April 2015, Uber updated their app to version 3.43.6.  Iphone and Android app stores immediately pushed the new update through.  Amazon did not get the new version and as of today (10th April 2015), still does not have it.  When I tried to use the Uber app last night, I was told to download the updated version.  I removed the app and reloaded it but it still did not work.  When  I called Amazon on the Mayday App, they were super nice but explained that the updated version of Uber had not made it to the Amazon version of Android.  I was literally left standing in the rain and missed an important meeting.  If the Amazon version of Android is going to be last in line for apps and updates, I don't think this is a phone that makes sense.  If you cannot depend on it, then it becomes obsolete.
The music app is terrible which I think is a basic requirement for a phone. The lack of apps (onebusaway, car2go) is a bummer too.
not happy - many of the apps that I use daily are not avail on the amazon app site (basic ones like starbucks and dunkin donuts) - you have to go to an outside app site to find -which you have to give permission for them to turn your phone on,  etc - too weird for me<br/>even the tech help on the phone representatives couldn't help - same with AT and T.<br/><br/>but the screen is crystal clear - the pictures excellent and sound excellent
I think it’s completely unnecessary that many of the Fire's key features, like unlimited cloud photo storage, are supported by Amazon's data centers that are powered by coal and other dirty energy. If Amazon matched competitors like Apple by powering their operations with clean and renewable energy, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.

Returned it after 4 days.  Went back to Galaxy.  This phone has some cool features but I would hands down rather have google services and all the apps than the "limited" amazon app store and lack of functionality in Maps, contacts and texts.  Once you are used to the genius features of google services it is at the very least frustrating and on some level painful to lose them.  Sorry Amazon I love your prime service and your amazing and seemingly endless shopping selections but your smart phone isn't that smart and the smoke & mirrors of your dynamic perspective and firefly can only mask your inadequacies for so long...
Can i use the fire phone in Africa/ghana
Now if i can only figure everything out!
I got it for one dollar, so it is worth that. The Fire Phone has a great screen, and a very good camera. It is really bad as far as apps go. YouTube does not work on it. No google things work on it. In that regard it is junk. Only a small number of apps work with Fire Phone. Plus compared to other amazon devices, the Wi-Fi reception is very very weak. Weaker than most other phones. I couldn't even use in my house.
I have had a Samsung galaxy for a couple of years I disappointed that the fire phone had almost none of the Apps I used on a daily basis I did not care for the camera the fire fly thing I felt was a waste of time I returned a know have a galaxy 5 active and are very happy I wanted the fire phone and it to work for me but in the end I liked the galaxy better sorry
This Fire Phone is not as good as advertised, it keeps on freezing up and shutting down. Don't t like it.
I am disappointed a little because I can't access some apps because it is not compatible with the  Kindle Fire Phone.
I've had this phone for one full year.  I can say, that after going through many phones, this is the best phone I've ever owned.  I've learned all of the nuances and use the features with it way more than I ever thought I would.  My wife says the same thing.  We couldn't be more pleased.  We wanted to get one for my daughter for Christmas, but see they are unavailable.  I'm hoping they come back soon.
The only redeeming feature is the Firefly app which has saved me money, but with the lack of true android app compatibility, no led notification light on the phone or even a lock screen notification of messages makes this phone a pain in the azz to own. There are plenty of better phones on the market for a much cheaper price with better features. Avoid this phone unless you must have the firefly app
this phone is horrible, don't buy it!  the mayday feature disappears after awhile so you can't ask for help.  Mine now is vibrating constantly for no reason, doesn't get texts, calls, or any ability to check voice mail. I only use it for candy crush which I am at a high level at and that is the only reason I keep it in service.  It's been charging for 3 hours starting at 30% and is only at 51% now
Love,Love it
This phone sounds as if metal is scraping against metal when I dial and while I am talking. I finally found another AT&T; store where there was a wireless genuis and he said I needed a software update. Got one and the sound isn't as frequent. AT&T; adjusted my bill. The mayday feature is great. You get live help instantaneously. Now I am relieved but still need another software update.
I look forward to 4 am everyday-CLEAVER<br/>you'll see why for yourself if you decide to get the fire phone-IT'S A SECRET<br/>I never had a phone I liked so much-AMAZON<br/>It is well built-YOU DON'T HAVE TO REBOOT IT EVERY 5 MINUTES LIKE THE HTC ONE<br/>It's a fun phone-REALLY<br/>The camera is iffy-BUT STILL GREAT<br/>Now I have to get the broom stick out-AMAZON<br/>My only complaint to-AMAZON<br/>Is that you don't have Joy Collins in the music or App store she is in Google play you can contact her through Twitter @JoyCollinsMusic-GET ON IT AMAZON<br/>I also would like Jarrod Johnson in the music and App store you can contact him AMAZON at @jarrodmjohnson<br/>All the way around I have to say it's a great-PHONE I REALLY LIKE IT<br/><br/>If you are looking for a fun one of a kind phone this phone is for you. There's no other phone on the market like it. It is great for video playing games and creating pics. May Day is awesome and it's easy to navigate and get use to. The phone is so different you will get frustrated at first but once you get the hang of it you will love it it's truly a one of a kind fun phone I'll never have another phone it's that great
Do not like that you cannot download the same apps like you can with Google or Android apps. I used to be able to get all my tests loaded onto myosuchart and you don't have it as well as my credit card apps. I would really love to see all apps on every type of Android phone.  This phone has some nice features but it needs more if your going to compete with other phones.
This phone needs a major update it's not much to do with it at least update the app store I've had this phone for a week and already I'm bored with it...I do compare it to its competition which are Apple and Android and so far Amazon is taking a huge loss I'm just going to be patient before I change between phones
No instructions, can not delete calls. Voice mail does not work.amazon dropped the ball on this phone
Great phone!! runs really smooth.
Like the Fire Phone but it comes with NO User Guide and u have to buy it Kindle edition .???? Confused from a non-tech person ! Not Happy But My Daughter gives it 5 stars . Not user friendly , such as can delete call history except one by one . No Instructions come what so ever , Kind of disappointed !
It's an ok phone. The battery, as I type this, is at 55% after powering it on at 9am for the first time. The blatant "buy this" all over the phone is a bit much. Firefly? A feature designed to help me easily buy more? No thanks.<br/><br/>But what is an absolute deal breaker? No google apps. No chrome? No Gmail? No google drive?<br/><br/>Powering this down now, submitting a return request, and putting the SIM back into my iPhone. As annoying as the lack of some features on the iPhone is, they have the google apps that I am highly entwined with.<br/><br/>No phone feature is worth the loss of integral apps I use on a daily basis.
I just returned from two weeks for work in Naples, Italy.  The Fire Phone worked fine the first few<br/>days, then I started getting this error msg:<br/><br/>"Restricted Access Changed, Data Service is Blocked" and it would not connect to the local network.<br/><br/>I tried everything, and finally had to do a factory reset, multiple times.  I used a friend's phone to<br/>call into the ATT Service desk, and they couldn't figure it out.  And yes, I had "data roaming" turned on.<br/><br/>It seemed to start when Amazon did a software push to update the Lock Screens (Screen Savers), and<br/>when the factory reset erased them it worked again, but then reappeared a day later, so I had to do<br/>another factory reset.<br/><br/>And yes, I disabled the automatic updates.  Now that I am back in the USA, its working fine, but I am<br/>reluctant to enable auto updates.
okay. here is my review so far. the data plan is fine but it seems like there is so much that loads the usage up. can you please send an email to clarify what is usage and what is not. is it the Kindle Fires that are sucking up the flow? I have not added any apps, new stuff or ??? to my phone. a concerned consumer. and grandpa.
Awesome!!!
Good except need a back button
This phone was not what I spectated I had problems from the start, defensively  not what I hope to get from Amazon Fire.<br/>from screen freezing  keyboard not working pages stopping, not getting massages, Shearing massages that I never shear, send my contacts to to one other Phone in my contract.... and many more things
It’s time to put out the Fire! It makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud is not a strong selling point, especially when competitors like Apple are using 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon can commit to using modern energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.

Enjoyed a few extra things, such as 3d screens but there many things missed. Being able to simply go "back" and changing your keyboard's look, including size and fonts, was a sorely missed senility. Either I don't know how or their isn't a way to change ther text message size. Hoping updates will help with issues
I am not impressed with all the glitches this phone has. Should have stuck to tablets...
I would love this phone if I could personalize it! It's awesome, but I can't add personal pictures to the background nor use the music I purchased from Amazon as a ringtone nor notification sound. The calender has too many limitations. Zynga games aren't compatible. No further complaints. Everything else is love...
Runs on dirty energy
Very disappointed! Was really looking forward to getting this phone but I am going back to my iPhone. None of the apps I use on a regular basis are available and I found the Fire to be a bit confusing to operate.
This is a great product. Don't get it for games. It doesn't work well yet with them, having too much lag, and they haven't released any patches to turn the dynamic perspective off.  They will, I'm sure, and the technology with smoothen out over time. For now it has a lot of cool new features that other phones don't have and syncs well.<br/><br/>Not that customizable, but it is still really nice. In general Android and Apple phones just pretend to be customizable anyway, tricking people into thinking the phone is modifiable when it really isn't.<br/><br/>This is getting apps really fast too, since it is so close to android. I think once developers figure the phone out better it will get better apps than the other phones on its own.
I bought bought this Dam phone, I sure wish I would have read the reviews on this piece of junk before I bought it. I can't use any of my apps, and the stupid web browser doesn't work properly. I have a paid music and VUDU account that I can't use and I can't even use my mobile banking app. I am stuck with a  $500 piece of junk, until I can afford to buy a good phone again which will be in about a year, since I live on a small fixed income. I would not recommend this phone to anyone, so if you are looking to buy a new phone ,get the Galaxy 5, it is a great phone and it takes great pictures. It will get all of the apps. that you can think of, and it has a great reception.On a scale of 1 - 10 I would give it a 12+.
none of my apps work on it, and it constantly goes black when I am trying to do something.like adjust the volume.. it will go black before I have a chance to touch the screen.  It still kicks me out of programs while I am using it and I have had it replaced once already.. the only thing that fixed was the heat problem.. getting too hot to hold.. Not very happy with it. Have had a couple of months and really not happy with it... thinking of trading it in for an iphone.. wish I had not changed phones.
I wish I had done research before buying this phone. What a horrible mistake. What was Amazon thinking when they ok'd a phone that didn't even have the ability to mute a ring on an incoming call by hitting one button. EVERY phone out there does that but this one. This could have been such a winner but you guys screwed the pooch on this phone. Firefly works mediocre at best. Sure you have access to all of Amazon primes movie library but what good is it with a battery that will burn out in less time than it takes to see the movie. I want a refund!
I'm really disappointed with this phone. Here are some reasons:<br/>1) It's very slow at times and it seems like it's a step behind my selections.<br/>2) Constantly needs to restarted to clear a freeze or to eliminate waits to perform a function.<br/>3) It has gone into the airplane mode on it's own a couple of times for no reason. I didn't select it.<br/>4) Many of the apps I've tried to get are not available for this phone.<br/>5) The camera button is in a bad place. If I pick it up wrong or try to take it out of my pocket it turns the camera on.<br/>It's my opinion that Amazon rushed the development of this phone to grab a piece of the market and in the process, released a product with too many bugs. I have the latest software version, but<br/>they're probably going to have to put out several more versions to fix a lot of these problems.

The Fire could be MUCH better.I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.

I've been an iPhone user for 5 years, always buying the latest iPhone when it came out. I decided it was time to make the switch as there really hadn't been many new innovations with the latest iPhone releases and I wanted to try something new. I pre-orderd through my local AT&T; store. I couldn't be more happier with the decision.<br/><br/>The Fire phone has a very intuitive UI and plenty of new innovative features that make it a legitimate challenger to any phone I've seen available. I was most concerned about the switch from iOS to Amazon's customized version of Android, but within a day of using the phone I felt very comfortable being able to navigate around the phone. I like the Fire phone's size compared to the iPhone 5S. It's larger, but not really any thicker, and you can use it with one hand like I was used to with the iPhone.<br/><br/>The Dynamic Perspective feature is very cool, however I haven't really found any practical uses for it yet. I'm hoping that as more apps come out this feature will really set the Fire phone apart from others. I do like the "peek" feature where you can slightly tilt the phone and see additional information such as with the maps app. Firefly is very easy to use. I tried it out on a few products around the house and also used it to identify some songs in a restaurant I went to. It quickly returned the correct results each time I tested it.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm glad I made the switch and so far don't miss much about the iPhone other than the app selection, which will hopefully be increasing for the Fire phone in the near future.
The phone always gets stuck ( freeze)!!! After 2 weeks of having my phone:(
Amazon  fire is nothing short of amazing.  You have,to see it. Flo  RENO+++
I like a lot of the features this phone has to offer, but the drawbacks override the benefits... The main downfall of this device is that the screen is very very fragile and within the first 30 days of owning the device the phone fell from less that a foot off the ground that the screen completely shattered. i had a case on it that i purchased from amazon as well that was supposed to absorb shock if the device was dropped, yeah not so much. On top of the fact that the device has a cracked screen, a replacement screen is all but impossible to find. So im stuck with a broken phone, until i find a screen replacement, it just seems like a poorly constructed phone, especially since i've dropped my samsung s5 from like 4 feet and it had no damage whatsoever.... i should have stuck to another samsung!
I am very unhappy that you are using dirty energy to power your facilities,  unlike your competitors.  Please change your energy sources to contribute to a cleaner earth.
Not happy with no emijos. Android version of games have problems: reward systems, icons that are blank. Some apps offer only 'limited' editions, not full additions.<br/><br/>Other annoying things also have made me decide to get rid of Fire & purchase IPhone
This phone doesn't even deserve a star.  This phone is so horrible. The only 3d about the phone is the lock screen. Then what else I hate about it is that there was an update for the phone n they send me an outdated phone....so in order for the phone to get updated you need WiFi bc it won't work on it mobile data. Which is an inconvenience. Also the app store is horrible. I can't download none of my bank apps or half the apps I use on a daily basis. I think Amazon tried to be like Apple and failed. I wouldn't recommend thus phone to no-one. ..now I know why it was only .99 to sign a contract with att
It is not easy or user friendly. to use as my iPhone. I bought this to transfer my Verizon iPhone account to ATT fire phone.  I'm keeping my Verizon iPhone. I love the look and feel of the fire phone and the high quality graphics. I have the fire tablet which I adore and the fire stick that are great but the phone is disappointing. ATT charges are not stable and laden with  extra charges that take my 65.00 a month bill to between 60.00 and 72.00 and this was after my initial bill that was 138.00.  I had so much trouble using the phone to access help with apps that wouldn't launch that on  two two occasions I called ATT customer service I was pleased with their help; but I had to call. I'm using my phone as a mini tablet and a few occasional calls.
Love it!
Wasteful technology that is a step backwards for our planet. With all the brain power ensconced at Amazon, one would think a greener phone would have been a snap.
I really wanted to love
The phone is not as fast as they say, and I can't talk on it or search for something on the internet for more than 2 minutes, without it so hot I have to put it down. It needs a spot for a memory card. And the app store needs bigger selections.
It's difficult almost impossible to read the screen in sunlight
Amazon missed an immense opportunity to introduce a paradigm shift and change the mobile landscape forever by giving users choice to buy phones like they buy television sets where devices are not tied to one service provider such as AT&T.; Amazon could have killed the competition and sold millions of Fire Phones, if it was available unlocked with no contract for only $199.99.  Let customers decide which phone company to go with. It would have been even better if the phone comes with another version for CDMA networks such as Sprint. That way, customers will have more choices to pick from. In addition, Amazon should not have used the modified Android software which is its greatest blunder as many users prefer Android apps not available in Amazon store. It's about time to be less arrogant and learn something from this serious strategic mistake. Keep the price low and offer users unprecedented choices. That would have been the winning strategy.
I will keep this brief and to the point, since there are so many lengthy reviews. This phone is a big disappointment. For the price you're paying, I expect much, much more (something remotely comparable to an iPhone). My biggest complaints are the following: (1) the processor is SLOOOOOOOOW. When I take a photo or try to access my photos, it's not uncommon to see a black screen for a LONG time while it seems to "think". That's annoying and usually I just give up and ask someone else to take the photo using their phone. (2) The apps… what apps? Amazon will boast of the many apps designed for the fire phone but these are second rate apps filled with ads and 9/10 apps that I've wanted to download for use don't even exist (in any form) in their app store. It's depressing. Smart phones are useless without apps. Some notable missing apps: snapchat, google hangouts, mapmyrun, Jet Blue app, urban spoon, living social. The lack of Google Hangouts and Living Social especially make me think Amazon purposely (and strategically) excluded anything that could be considered competition for Amazon's competitive positioning. Another frustration (just because) is that the phone comes with an Amazon shopping app, Kindle app, Audible app, and silly games pre-downloaded to the device. These apps CANNOT be deleted by users/phone owners. C'mon, Amazon. I thought you were the "most customer centric company in the world". I'm calling your bluff. I'm happy to report that I'm finally switching back to the iPhone and will never, ever go back.
Does not have nearly as many features that most androids have.
I'm not a fan of an android phone. I had a Windows phone before I was eligible for upgrade. I decided on the amazon fire phone. Based on the camera and the amazon prime subscription. That's probably the only good thing. The phone doesn't swipe properly nor does it shift when you tilt the phone as it says it's supposed too. It works poorly when connected to Wi-Fi. Apps that were available on my Windows phone aren't available on the fire phone. Which is sad as Windows phones have less apps then android. All in all I wish I never gave up my Windows phone. It may only have had a 8 mp camera but it was definitely faster on Wi-Fi and smoother all the way around.
I have been a Kindle user since the first one. I love all my Kindles so I thought that I couldn't go wrong with the Fire Phone. I was already a Prime user so that didn't even matter to me. I was really excited to get it in the mail. I had been a Samsung person for many years but was willing to change because of the Kindle. The phone is so not great. There are a ton of apps you cant get because the phone is not an android. I cant upload video to Facebook. The battery life barely makes it through the day. It's just not what I thought it would be. This is the first product from Amazon that I am not over the hill in  love with and so wanted to be
It freezes from time to time for no reason. And a bit slow
I was unable to get some apps that I had from my other phone...unable to get local news apps to help me keep notified about my area. Not pleased....will keep trying; would rather have old phone back! Very good graphics.
I have for the most part written as honest and polite review of everything I have purchased from Amazon. When I first got my fire phone, I loved it. There are still a few features I like about it, but honestly I don't love the phone. All the apps I have been use to are not available. It isn't compatible with hardly anything. I have to keep it awhile because of the investment. I can honestly say, I wish I could return it, let Amazon keep the money I paid on the free year of Amazon Prime, and credit the $59.00 to my account.  I really miss using the Iphone, and next time I won't be so quick to buy something new and unfamiliar.
It has not been very fun yet. Interesting but not fun. Finally transfered my contacts. My son asked the VOICE what was it's name it replied it does not know that yet.
So I think I am like a lot like the people who have purchased the Amazon Fire....I really really wanted to love it. I almost feel bad not giving it a better rating...I really think it should only get 2 stars but my loyalty to Amazon doesn't allow me to give it any less than the 3 I gave it. I received it with a slight crack in my screen. (I contacted Amazon and they were extremely helpful and pleasant and just a little over 24 hours later I had a brand new phone awaiting me.) I come from an iPhone background and I have only had iPhone's in the last 7 years. I figured it was time for something SHINEY and NEW and thought "Hey if anyone can deliver it has to be Amazon, right?" So I preordered my phone still under contract, still with a perfectly well functioning iPhone...Paid the FULL price up front...and Bam...After the first 2 days there was nothing...no more interest...that presale instant attraction I had once felt was GONE!! The phone freezes on me all of the time, screen goes dark, doesn't allow me to go back to the home screen...the locked Dynamic Perspective is kind of losing its coolness factor when you can't unlock the phone...a lot of the products I use Firefly can't find, phone #'s are usually misread. My only hope is that they will repair all of these glitches sooner than later. Phone gets really hot if you use it for too long; about 20-30 minutes of active texting, streaming music/video, or just talking on the phone.<br/>It also seems that even the Amazon apps don't work that well either. I did a few side by side comparisons of using the Kindle app, Audible, and Music Prime on both my Fire and iPhone both over WiFi and 8 out of 10 times my iPhone worked best!<br/>If this was my first smartphone and I didn't know BETTER existed I would say this was a really really cool phone...but I have...and this just isn't all I hoped it would be. It also takes a while for the pictures to load or for the camera feature to load.<br/>My plea to Amazon is that they get MORE apps and fix these glitches ASAP.
couldn't be happier! previous phone was  LG Optimus L9.  it was supposed to have 2G memory but most was used up with pre-installed apps which you can't get rid of.  towards the end i would have to restart the phone just to "clean up" memory briefly in order to open email.  couldn't load any new apps even though i only had a few of my own on it.  had to delete ones i really liked just to load up a new one (maybe).<br/>then there's this phone. . .with 32G memory!  yippee! so far I've loaded up about all i need and i still have 26G remaining! one side button to immediately start camera is fantastic . . .no missed shots anymore and no 4 button actions to get camera functioning.  also, with previous phones, it took a long time to activate things.  now, with faster processor, things are really quick.<br/><br/>implements a new home screen every day which i think are neat and really showcases the dynamic perspective.  very high resolution camera plus everything you snap  is automatically saved in cloud with NO limits!  very reassuring.  includes prime so i had my membership extended a year.  downloading free music and watching videos is super cool.  instant live video help is also quite the benefit. . .i doubt any other manufacturer will EVER offer this.<br/><br/>One handed auto scrolling is nice except they didn't implement it on things they have control over like the phone log and contacts. also in order to rapidly locate a contact you have to press search and then enter some characters. i would like to see a scroll bar on right to rapidly position from "a" to "z"..  it uses the "peak" feature to display the time of calls in the phone log.  trouble is, why not always display that?  when i peak to see time, it's faint and positioning back to straight on "hides" the date/time.<br/>I'm sure some of these oversights will be corrected in future builds, which we get automatically. biggest downfall is it can't use the android "playstore".  instead the Fire operating system has it's own app store and many of the ones i used are absent. Like many bank specific apps (ALLY), original craigslist, youtube, touchtunes,and more.  I'm sure in time these will come so it was not a "deal breaker".<br/>seems many of the apps that support Fire OS, however, don't use  the available functions like left and right panel, peak, 3D(dynamic perspective) and swipe from bottom to go back . . .too bad.<br/> i find it creative that they got rid of the usual 3 navigation buttons and only have the one. . .HOME. it  makes it simple.  to go back on almost any screen you swipe from bottom rather than hit a specific button.  swiping once from top on any screen gives you instant access to flashlight, WiFi, settings, airplane mode and more.<br/><br/> everyday Fire OS gives you a new "featured"  free app to download if you want which is a nice touch, although many are games. of course it integrates nicely with all amazon features and shopping including it's cloud storage for music, photos and personal..<br/> i honestly think i would be disappointed going back to any other "smart" phone. with this phone they didn't just offer one new feature and save the rest for future versions. . .they came out of the chute with a lot of unique features and offerings.  very impressed. plus, with the AT&T; update program, i get to trade it in for any new fire phone in 18 months i believe.. .and I'm paying for the phone in installments although it amounts to slightly more.
I loved it, but had to return it since ATT didn't honor their original price.  They increased my bill by $40/month.  $200 was too much to pay for 2 phones.
Amazon's cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power!
The Amazon Fire is a good phone, however, I do not like the app store. I'm a huge fan of Google play store. It's just difficult to obtain some things from the app store. That is frustrating at times.
I love this phone!
Is very good phone
I love the phone it's self but the app store is weak. I really miss the google play store. I didn't realize I wouldn't have access to it. I am hoping the Amazon app store gets stronger very soon.
Nice phone mix between iPhone and Samsung. However heats up and gets hot when on internet for 20 minutes. Sound very faint with screen protectors on.  Can't download banking and credit card apps
Climate change is real and it is irresponsible and selfish for your business to not consider the environmental impact you are having. Using fossil fuels is outdated. Facebook, Microsoft and Google are already jumpstarting the green internet revolution by using renewables to power their data centers. You should too.
Can't get all of the apps I had on my other phone
I was really disappointed.  I think the phone has a lot of potential. However there were just some things I couldn't get past in my switch over from iPhone 4S to Amazon Fire phone.  The App Store had a lot less apps than I what I expected. There were lots of games available if you're into that but not the apps I needed. The camera was really great and I loved the larger screen.  The mayday feature was awesome. There were some other things that were bothersome too, but after about 10 days I had to switch back to my iPhone.
I had this phone for about a week and had to let it go before my love for Amazon became diminished. This could and would be an awesome phone only if Amazon would drop their weak Fire OS 3.5.1 ( which really is sad to say the least ) for Android KitKat or at the least Ice Cream leaving room for future Android OS updates. I would even reconsider a re-purchase if they did that...
I feel like I've been ripped. First waved came out bought full retail value then not less than 6 months this phone went down to $100.00<br/>Not right. Now I have trust issues.
Not as user friendly as I was led to believe.
I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews. They all seem to be aimed about Silk's server-side processing and their energy usage which has nothing to do with the phone itself...<br/><br/>I have used Motorola X and iPhones throughout the years and love this phone. I love the interface and have no problems with the phone whatsoever. Highly recommend it.
Worst phone I have ever had. You can't control data on apps, and has no access to Google apps, and the recreation apps to mimic Google are terrible at best. Most apps have 2-3 our of 5 stars rating. I love Amazon, and really wanted this phone to be what it claims, but it's too simple, not customizable and not controllable enough to qualify as a smart phone...
I really, really wanted to love this phone.  I purchased it as soon as it came out, as I am a huge fan of Amazon.  Customer Service rocks (most of the time).  I assumed the CS would continue to be excellent with this phone.  WRONG!!  After owning the phone for 3-1/2 months, I saw what I thought was a piece of hair on the screen when I picked it up, but it was a crack running from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen.  When I called Mayday I was given the third degree; did I drop the phone, did I put it in my purse, did I have it in my pocket?  Seriously, I'm afraid to touch it now.  Since I purchased it from AT&T;, I was told to contact them, blah, blah, blah and then did I have insurance blah, blah, blah.  I do have insurance, but the deductable is $125.00.  I do not feel I should have to pay $125.00 for a new phone after such a short period of time when the "durable gorilla glass" breaks when the phone is just set down.  Back to Samsung for me when this contact is up.
Love the phone hate the app store.  Wish amazon would keep up with the app google and iPhone come out with.  Or make it easier to use Google store that would be nice too.
It's a nice phone and does what you need it to but very limited options also the ringtones are horrible. Best ever battery life though and great screen just needs more.
I preordered this phone through Amazon a couple days before it was launched and received it on launch day. When I made my purchase I went through all the motions to become an AT&T; customer and to keep my original phone number. However, when I got my phone and went to set it up my phone number was not recognized. After 40 minutes on the phone with AT&T; they concluded that they needed to send me a sim card and then I could go ahead and call their GoPhone department when I received that to register my old number to my new phone. I was very confused. I kept the new number my phone came with and looked on the bright side that I didn't have to let certain people know my new phone number.<br/><br/>The phone works great, the battery life doesn't seem to be even a little bit close to what they had promised in the specs. One thing I do miss about my GalaxyS3 are the emoji apps that appear right in my text keyboard. I'm surprised that a phone being launched in 2014 doesn't have those already built in when texting is such a primary means of communication. I tried to find an app to somewhat match the one I had and there isn't one available.<br/><br/>I also wish that I had an option to read my text messages on the lock screen rather than having to open up the screen every time. Certain people I need to respond to faster and others can wait but without the option of seeing who has texted me I am forced to open and see every time.
Love this phone
For Amazon's first smartphone, I think they did very well. However, the phone is not great by any means. I want to first start with the advantages of this phone compared to other smartphones with the same price tag. The 13MP camera is absolutely beautiful! I have never takes such nice pictures on a handheld device before. Also, MAYDAY is a huge plus! I have used them twice and all the representatives were very educated and helped me as best as they could. Time for the downfalls. The battery on this device may be the worst I have ever seen. For example, Fully charged at 100% and the device is removed from the charger at 9AM. Without ever unlocking the device with absolutely no use, it has managed itself down to 87% by 12:30PM. If the battery drops that much in such a short time, imagine how it would react with constant use. Also, the interface needs improvements. It is not impossible to use, but you will need assistance from one of their representatives! Overall, Amazon did well with their first smartphone. The next design/model will need improvements if they plan on keeping their customers. The camera is a high plus but the battery life makes me want to send it right back. I possibly might be returning this device due to the fact it is constantly dying and needs roughly a whole nights charge to recuperate.
First of all, I've never had a "smartphone" before, so my experience is not as extensive as other reviewers.<br/>I like this phone. I've never had any trouble with it. I've been able to watch YouTube videos and use Google and Google mail with no problem. The Amazon, Kindle and Firefly features are especially appreciated.<br/>For users of iPhones and Samsung phones the Fire phone may not be their thing simply because they has grown used to the the way those phones work in the same way that a user of a ballpoint pen may not appreciate the usage of a fountain pen. They do the same things just in different ways.<br/>My only criticism of the phone is that it did not come with a printed instruction book. But the Fire phone has a "help" feature that gets one in contact with a real person to answer questions.<br/>I think it's a good phone and it does anything I could ask of it. I would recommend this phone to anyone.
This phone totally sucks  it lags , overheats ,doesn't recognize AMAZON Earbuds and worst off all its not an android device and cannot download things from  google
I've been a loyal customer to Amazon. I really love my phone and I paid 199 almost 3 months and now its .99 I think all of us who bought it early should get another reward like a second year of prime. What say all of you loyal customers
I'm loving my Fire Phone!<br/><br/>Dynamic Perspective is super cool, and a step-change in user interface for screen-ed devices.<br/><br/>Also, really enjoying using Firefly.<br/><br/>The device is beautifully packaged, and was fun to open.  The screen is also beautiful, crisp.  The device is fast and packed with memory.
It's just you gotta go through slot to download music but other than that I don't like the keyboard I like big keyboards but it's a great phone other than that
Worst decision ever to purchase this phone, don't even think of buying it!  Phone has poor apps selection, after 2 months it became very slow. Don't buy it!
Loving the new phone! The functionality is great and has been easy to learn to navigate. The Mayday feature is awesome and nearly all of the apps I used on OIS are available. I would recommend this phone to anyone who likes Apple or Android products. Dynamic Perspective, Firefly and Mayday set this phone apart!
Phone is ok. It doesn't do anything that an android does. The phone would be a lot better if it operated under the android system or offered the same apps.
I can't change the font size of text messages. Mayday is a nice service, but they only confirmed that it can't be done.<br/>The battery doesn't last long enough.<br/>Snapchat isn't available. Neither is softcard. Or several other apps that I want.<br/>I love the kindle fire, but this phone is a pos.
I'm on a famy plan with shared data and FIRE PHONE is using up most of it. Will be shutting it down too costly for data usage. Beautiful phone though.
Only support Bluetooth 3.0?  That's a very old spec. For the phone to support Bluetooth Smart devices, you need at least<br/>Bluetooth 4.0, or the newest Bluetooth 4.1.
Not happy with this phone at all<br/> This is the third phone I have had. I have cracked the screen twice. I have had phones for over 15 years and never have I ever cracked the screen. I don't like that many apps.don't work.properly. I was very disappointed especially since I love my Kindle. Can't wait to pay this phone off so I can get a different phone.
Too heavy, not big enough for me, and after 2 months, still not figuring out certain things on it. But I'll give it a try still.
Not a fan of this product. I think it’s completely outrageous that many of the Fire's key features, like unlimited cloud photo storage, are supported by Amazon's data centers, which are powered by coal and other dirty energy. If Amazon matched other competitors by powering their operations with clean and renewable energy, or at the very least making public their environmental impact, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review
The Fire could be MUCH better.I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.
Our family loves this phone. Our son with down syndrome can use it with no problem :)
This phone worked well for a while, I was actually really happy with it. I have had the phone for 2 months now and it is ridiculously glitchy. It just had a 20 minute episode where it was turning on and off over and over again for no reason. Also, I cant make it through a normal day without this phone dying. I recommend buying a different phone
Nice
It really pains me to give this phone this low of a review, it really does. I was sincerely looking forward to using the Amazon phone as a way for me to be able to enjoy an android device that would actually work with my predominantly Mac computers both at home and in my office. Alas, I'm afraid to say that my excitement and my anticipated infatuation with the device was met with a swift reality check after nearly a few days with the device.<br/><br/>The major issues that I take with the phone is the complete lackluster support for the device in the app store. Of course, that may be something that could be implemented a bit later once the app store matures, but as of writing this review, the store hasn't improved. Something extremely curious about the app store in particular, is that Amazon doesn't offer any card reading apps (Square, Paypal, and most curiously Amazon's Local Register). As a business owner, I was hoping that this phone would be able to use a credit card reading app, and having heard that Amazon was offering an alternative to Square and Paypal. Oddly enough, Amazon chose not to support their Fire Phone with this app, and allowing the app to be predominantly featured on iOS and select Samsung devices. Sure the app works on the Kindle Fire HDX, but being as my tablet only has WiFi, it really is worthless. Of course, this lack of app store could have been a moot point had Amazon included "Google Play," but unfortunately, it hadn't.<br/><br/>One of the other large glaring problems that I had was the network strength. I lose significant amount of strength from my cell towers, unable to load videos, web pages, download apps or anything. I've had several missed calls as a result, as well as having multiple dropped calls, even though I'm at full signal strength.<br/><br/>Some positives: The camera is adequate for a cellphone camera, and the Firefly is a nice addition that appears to be a bit more accurate at picking out specific songs or videos than any other app on the market today. The screen size is a good size, and the dual speakers are certainly an improvement over the iPhone's single speaker. Also, I kind of enjoy the 3D perspective a bit more than I should, regardless whether it's a gimmick.
Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. I am upset that one of the Fire’s key features, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, comes with a hidden and harmful cost. Unlike Apple and Google who have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s data centers are powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary.
The phone looks nice, and seems to be holding up well for the few months that I have had it. I'm starting to have some freezing issues with the OS and on some apps. I have also found that you can not always get the apps from the store that you want. The map program installed is mediocre at best, and I'm not allowed to download Google maps to use instead. Some apps that you can use usually quit after an update.....<br/><br/>In general, it would be a good starter phone or maybe a kid's phone. If you are used to the higher end phones I would not recommend this.<br/><br/>It will work until my contact ends, and then back to Samsung!<br/><br/>Once again this phone has pissed me off!!! Open the damn app store so I can be like everyone else with an Android!!!<br/><br/>I HATE THIS PHONE
Sorry the fire did just what the name implies got so hot in my hand after being in use for a while. It also overheated while charging. I must admit that the camera features were awesome it is the best that I have seen. Amazon needs to do some work on this phone and improve it.
Got the fire. I wanted it badly. Bought the ATT plan with it. Got the phone in the mail. Could not activate it. Called ATT. They won't give me a plan. Fire is awesome, ATT SUCKS.
...my very first smartphone owned by a not-so-smart user - need a few weeks to get used to it all !!!
I like the new fire phone, but I do not love it. I like the camera but I don't like the fact that I only have half of the games that I had in my old phone:) and it is very difficult to download all of my music. I think I would have been better off with a Samsung or iPhone.
I love Amazon products and their customer service. This is the first time that I have ever been disappointed - and I haven't even purchased the phone. The only service provider they give you an option to go with for a better deal is AT&T.; You can purchase the phone with a 2 year contract and their lowest price package only includes 300 megabytes of data and it is $60.00 a month. OR, you can finance the phone, get the same package for $45.00 a month plus the price of the phone payment. So, you are being penalized for paying for the phone up front. Not to mention the VERY HIGH cost of AT&T;'s phone plans. I currently have Cricket service and I pay $55.00 a month for unlimited talk, text and data. Why would a top notch company like Amazon partner with AT&T;? AT&T; is giving really poor "deals".
yes there's No Google play so what, I really do love this phone. Sure the battery life isn't the best, but it's not like you should spend four hours straight on the phone. None of the programs have glitched on me and the year of prime and $10 app coins is worth it, plus the fact I got this for $.99. It was and is so easy to access and isn't a hassle compared to iphone. Hopefully they do improve on the battery, but for their first phone, they did awesome!<br/> So one year later and my warranty is expired and I swear my phone is giving me the middle finger. Every time I play music it plays through the phones speakers and not the aux cord, connected to my car. It keeps asking for internet connection, I press cancel and press play again and it plays through the phone's speakers again. I disconnect the aux cord and all in all I have to restart my phone to resolve this issue.<br/>  Now today when I switch from the internet to text messaging it keeps saying "sorry something went wrong.".. I have no clue went wrong?!<br/><br/>I've sent two messages to Amazon about my issues : No response<br/>Their live tech support don't know any solution and offer me a deal to buy a new one : No<br/>There is no trade in option<br/>Att doesn't even show them as selling it anymore on their website.......da fu?
Unhappy have a lot of games  running into needing upgrades that aren't available for the fire yet.
The Fire could be MUCH better.I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages
I'm returning for the new Samsung coming out in Sept.2014.  Fire has some nice features but way too many glitches.  Mayday, it uses Data which they don't tell you if you call it by the way, folks here don't know anymore than I did.  I could hear them thumbing through their manual trying to find the answers to my questions.  One guy told me to call back in 24hours!!  I guess he'd have more training by then?  Don't waste your money.
Very non-user friendly, screen contantly freezes, very difficult to navigate through apps.  This phone comes with NO instruction manual - it's all on the phone which makes it more frustrating when your phone is FROZEN all the time.  ATT is no help and while Mayday is helpful - just make sure your fully clothed when calling.  Would have been great to know that a live face pops up on your screen!!!!!!!!
Still learning,but seems to be really nice. Plus I get a discount at AT&T; through work.
Tiny and hard to use compared to my son's old Samsung phone. I hate it. You can't enlarge texts. The pictures it takes are great though so I have some good shots of my elderly dog. The gmail does enlarge unlike on my kindle fire.
What's the deal here? I got my fire phone about 2 weeks ago and I paid 199.00 now I could have gotten one for 99 cents what's going on??<br/><br/>Well Amazon came through like a trooper and gave me a refund for the Fire phone.. Thanks Amazon
Awesome phone! Better than expected. I previously had the iPhone 5S and Motorola-X. A lot of features I thought it would not have are built in! It is great knowing everything transferred no problem most of my favorite apps are there!
Disappointed that Amazon choses not to power their cloud data storage with 100% renewable energy when competitors like Apple do. I hate the idea of the climate, and thus our world, suffering because I chose unlimited photo storage powered by dirty energy, i.e., coal, gas and nuclear power. Amazon can do a LOT better. Please smarten this phone with clean renewable energy!!!
Such a rad phone!<br/>I highly suggest you head down to AT&T; and find out all te cool things this phone has to offer- because photos that don't use up your storage space AND it comes with 32g standard! That's just to start.
Had it 1.5 weeks it locked up 3 times had to reboot it<br/>Messed up games by not recognizing letters I selected & the keys would lock up even though times kept going.  Did funky things with my pics too<br/>I returned it
I like Apple and Google and Amazon.  I use a phone principally for telephone calls,<br/>email, text messages, the calendar, music and books.  It was time for me to try<br/>something other than another iPhone and I am very happy that I did.  The Fire Phone lacks only<br/>one app that I use and that is "coming soon."  I can wait.  It syncs with<br/>iPbone and Google calendars.  I discovered the Apple texting feature only works between two Apple<br/>devices, which I was disappointed to discover; I switched to Viber which I think is quite a bit better.<br/>Having to adapt to a few other differences also led to improvements for me.<br/>I am dismayed by the intense criticism from "experts" because it is not Google or Android.  I always try to<br/>support an underdog and believe more competition is to everyone's great advantage.  After using the<br/>phone for a couple of weeks, I am very pleased with my choice.
Love it
Love this phone!!!
The screen is too reflective, making it difficult to see the information on-screen at times.  In bright sunshine outdoors, it is almost impossible to decipher what is on the screen.<br/>  The wrist-action features are confusing to remember which does what --- maybe with practice, things will improve.<br/>  When connected to my computer, NO picture files were shown when the "Photos" phone folder was opened, even though there are photos on the phone!!!<br/>  The voice recognition seems to be better than others that I have tried.
Phone has small yet good features, but following are the downside<br/><br/>Give us something like you always do. A cheap, yet strong device. Cut the unnessary stuff from Fire Phone and we will have a better world of Amazon.<br/>Compulsory 32 GB phone at price of 16 GB. I am ok to have a 16 GB phone as I have access to cloud as well.<br/>My opinion: Cut the extra 16 GB(Lets start with a 16 GB version). If you are too keen, give an option to put the SD card!!<br/><br/>Fancy features of not great value: Dynamic Perspective<br/>Solution: Remove dynamic perspective(we can still retain most of the features using gyroscope). Dynamic perspective might be coming with millions of possibilities but not as of today there is no market created for it yet. So lets just remove it(This will be removing 4 cameras in the front)<br/><br/> This will make the phone lightweight with 4 cameras removed, reduced memory and hence will improve battery life and can be given at a reduced cost!! This should definitely reduce the overheating of the phone.<br/><br/>Imagine Amazon launching a "Fire Light" with same amount of access to amazon ecosystem, with an unlocked version at just $349. I'm sure people that is the customers are going to love it.<br/><br/>PS: Dynamic Perspective has 4 camera's in the front. Atleast give us access to the camera to capture the best selfie ever or something like that!
I'm insanely disappointed in my fire phone. I waited, and wanted it to grow on me. Maybe I would get used to all the glitches. The fact of the matter is, my phone is good for one thing. It's great for buying things on Amazon. I suppose that was really the point of the whole thing. They even made it difficult to get to all of that free streaming music you're supposed to have access to as a prime member. Do yourself a favor and stick the phone you already have. I had the iPhone and I regret my decision to switch.
Although this is a very good device, I am giving it only three stars due to it being locked to AT&T;! I bought it off contract and had called amazon customer service to ask if off contract meant unlocked and she said yes. After receiving device I realized it was really still locked to att. I would have to call att and ask them to give a a network unlock key. The Phone's OS is sharp, nice camera, nice graphics, has a learning curve to catch up but it's OK. Not able to install Whatsapp via the app store, awkward!.
It's a good phone but the apps suck...they don't even got clash of clans..
Nice phone but missing lots of stuff, can't get any ring tones on phone only the basic ones that come with phone, does not accept apps for our mobile banking hoping for Amazon will fix issues ,
Love it and the instant real time "skype' help staff is great idea as they helped me to walk through all of the new functions and are there in the future 24/7 if I should have a question.
I love my phone I'm learning how to do a lot on it I would tell everyone about it . It's a great phone once u learn how to do everything that I does. Best phone that I really love My great
Very disappointed. I really miss my iPhone 4. None of my favorite apps are available for the Fire phone. Didn't realize I couldn't download from Google Play... only from Amazon app store.
It's freezes sometimes but other than that the phone is pretty beast!!!
I have had the fire phone for awhile in fact it is my second one first one didn't work will guess what my second will not ring for me to answer phone call and I don't get my e-mails<br/>I have all the kindles and I love them but I am so disappoint in fire phone<br/>I got to get a phone the I will be able to answer and get email because my husband has dementia and I have to be to be able to be reach at all times<br/>I have no rating for this phone except very poor for me
Great! Everything that I wanted and more!
Great phone!!!!
Pros:<br/><br/>Hardware worked great, the firefly feature is pretty awesome.  And the dynamic perspective was really cool.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>No Google Apps, this includes YouTube, Google+, Gmail, Google, Google Drive, Chrome, Google Maps and others.<br/><br/>I had the phone for 1 day and was really impressed with it, I actually would have kept it, if it had Google Apps.  But literally the day after I got the phone I sent it back, this is because my life runs on Google.  What Amazon should have done was something more like what Apple did when it released the first iPhone.  The iPhone originally came with Google Maps, then once Apple Maps came out they removed Google Maps, but stilled allowed Google to put it on the Apple App store.  And Google is allowed to put all of its apps on the Apple App store.  Now I don't know if it is Google not putting the Apps on the Amazon App store or if Amazon is preventing Google from doing it.  But I would think that if you were to come out with a new phone, you would load it with as many familiar apps as possible for the new user, so that the transition from 1 phone to the other is easier.
I love this phone. Fits me very well. I'd definitely recommend it
I purchased my Fire Phone thru AT&T.;  Very disappointed with the phone and extremely disappointed now that the price has dropped (that much within two months).  I am a big apps user and very, very disappointed that I can only get 1/4 of the apps that I originally had on my other phone.  I was past the 14 day mark to exchange the phone.  AT&T; will do nothing about it and neither would Amazon because I purchased thru AT&T.;  I have been a shopper on Amazon for years, a prime member for years and own three Kindles and thought I would be happy with this phone - NOT.  Disappointed in AT&T; and Amazon, probably more with Amazon.  Stuck with it for another year :( !
I love my fire phone  but I have 1huge problem with the phone and amazon.I just spent hundreds of dollars on the phone itself. why should I have to buy a user manual ?
I don't like the Silk browser and the fact that the phone hates Google and Hulu so I cannot run certain things on it. A bit slow for my taste but it works well enough.
This is a terrible phone. App store is so small. Also you should be able yo disable LTE and you can't. So if your in a poor LTE signal location your service will suffer. The concept of the phone was good they just epic failed on the actual product.
I wish I had never left my iPhone. While the perspective is cool and all. The apps I commonly use aren't available, and I've had the issue where the keyboard completely disappears and I have to restart the phone. This has happened several times.
Still learning my way around as this is my first smart phone.  But, so far I'm impressed and can't wait until I get the hang of using it.
I am by no means a techie, but I liked the overall features of this phone. Firefly, dynamics, and maps are all pretty awesome features. The phone isn't too bulky and is comfortable to work with. Mayday is a really nice feature because half the time I can find the issue I'm looking for in help. The headphones are pretty good for stock.<br/>The down side?<br/>The battery life sucks! I'm on my phone constantly and end up having to charge it at least once a day if not more.<br/>It freezes up and I have to back out of whatever I'm doing and start over.<br/>There is no back button. You have to swipe up from the bottom to close pages and if you don't get it just right it keeps scrolling. Very annoying.<br/>Fire doesn't support Google Chrome and apps. Which is where I do a lot of my surfing, e-mail, and app downloading.<br/>Speaking of app downloading....while the App Store has a tone of apps I couldn't download a ringtone app. It only offers sounds and ringtone makers. I'm unable to download my banking app, so I have to keep my old phone with me so I can connect to Wi-Fi and check my bank accounts.<br/>Overall I'm very disappointed with the Amazon Fire phone. I knew better than to purchase a phone straight off the assembly line. I should've waited a year or two. I'd take it back to AT&T; but like a fool I threw away the box without thinking.
Love the phone, app selection is not the same as Apple store.
I CALL the Fire Phone an EPIC FAIL! I  literally cried, when I realized exactly how badly this phone performs. I wanted to love this phone, it should have been a great product. It is not. You use the mayday button and what they tell you is that they will let the manufacturer know. They don't have an answer, I am so completely disappointed in this phone. Amazon totally fubared this one! I wish that I could give a negative star. Some say to allow non Amazon apps to download, I tried that, still could not get the apps and it made my phone perform worse than it had prior to trying to do that.
Plagued with glitches. Wi-Fi switches off. Also, gets stuck in facebook. Not impressed!
Flip phone finally failed so had a a few options...use my work iPhone as my primary phone. get a pay as you go phone, or give in and get my own smart phone.  Went with the fire phone through ATT for the $200 upgrade to replace my relic. Being an amazon fan figured might as well give this a try as I have a Kindle and Amazon Fire TV box so might as well as there is some integration across devises; so far I like it much more than the iPhone 5 as it is more intuitive, has a larger and better screen.  As a non power user I just need to check my email, news and stock quotes and access amazon content..for those purposes I will pull this phone out before I use the iPhone.  I have seen comments that the fire phone might be non compatible with some Google Apps content due to the proprietary software overlay on the Google software
find it a bit awkward to use and a little cumbersom.  When checking e-mail the print is so tiny I realy can't read it. I'm somewhat disappointed in it.
This phone was over promoted, and had the potential to be so much more. As it is, it functions for phone calls and sending text messages well. Not being a true android, there area plethora of existing apps not useable with the phone. That is a shame and is where Amazon missed the boat. It could have been a best seller if it could live up to it's full potential. Amazon, fix this phone!
Great
I want to like it, but I can not connect it to the bluetooth in my car (come to find out its not compatible with my car (2011 Toyota Camry so not like its old or anything)according to amazon but was told to check with the dealership to see if there was something that could be done on their end, not inconvient or anything), I can not get alot of the apps that I had with my droid phone and Im trying to live with that, but now I have to carry two phones because the apps that I can get that were originally from google if they work they looks somewhat different or they only partially work. Also I like to play my music in my car from my phone, cant do that either.  I do not like the fact that you can not removed the battery.  My phone froze up a couple of times and there was nothing I could.  I could not shut it off, I could not contact mayday.  I was able to transfer the content of my old phone to my new phone but I am having trouble doing it on my moms phone so I was back and fourth today between AT&T; and mayday trying to figure it out and the last time I tried to connect to mayday it says: Mayday Warning.  We've noticed that you've been using Mayday service frequently.  If you are experiencing a technical issue contact us by phone or email.  My response to them was not cool.  What if it was an emergency and that was the only button I could push. The only options after that are to close or phone & email so I clicked on the phone and email and you literall have to answer a serise of questions to even get there and my problem wasnt even on the list so if thier trying to sell you on the whole mayday thing, I would not get it for that reason.  They make it sound like its the greatest thing, but now their going to limit it.  Whats next?  They have no idea why I am contacting them, could be for a completely different reason so again not cool at all.<br/><br/>Also, the flick of the wrist to go from screen to screen doesnt always work.  When that happens a couple of times I replayed the demo to make sure I wasnt doing anything wrong, I wasnt.  My last beef, I was telling a friend about the phone and the amazon prime for  year so we started looking around the site for a bit and she was like whats this crap?  I didn't notice this before because I hadn't bothered to check yet but she didn't like that fact that even if you have prime, you still have to pay for alot of the movies or rent them, which I have to agree with her.  I have other streaming sites that I pay monthly for and what you see is what you get and we do not pay extra so when the year is up I doubt I'll renew it and the moives were not even that great.<br/><br/>So then I started messing around with the prime music and it keeps everything seperate which makes me believe if you do not renew, you probably loose that music so they tell you, you can download it but I think the firephone controls weather you get to actually keep it or not, which you probably can not but dont quote because I do not really know for sure, but the thought alone makes me no want to waste anymore time on reaserching the music only to loose it down the road, whats the point in that<br/><br/>I was really stoked about getting this phone because I love my kindle from the very first one (I've bought 9 of them and even gave some as gifts not all online though) and I love Amazon and I have never had a bad experience with my purchases that Amazon did not go out of thier way to fix, but this phone is loosing its appeal very fast.<br/><br/>It just seems like you have to put alot of work and effort into getting the phone to work for you, to tailor it to you.  I'm trying to be patient and wait for them to work out all their issues, but in the mean time the Galaxy 5 is looking more and more appealing and I do not know if I can hold out for much longer<br/><br/>sorely disappointed
This phone is everything and more
Awesome phone!<br/>Firefly and dynamic perspective rules!<br/>nice look and feel
I unfortunately won't ever get to try this phone because Amazon's cloud relies on dirty, polluting forms of energy such as coal and gas. Amazon’s Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary. Storing our photos, music and messages shouldn’t mean we are forced to damage the health of our climate and communities. Apple, Facebook, and Google have figured out how to store our photos and music with renewable energy, and so can Amazon. It’s time to move to modern energy sources and make a “smarter phone” supported by clean, renewable energy.  Until then, it's just "One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.
I told them that this wouldn't sell.  Flop like almost everything Amazon does.
After many years of resisting buying a smart phone, I could not resist purchasing an Amazon Fire phone for $.99!  What a smart decision I made.  The phone looks great, works well, and  takes fantastic photos of my artwork.  The Kindle Ap which was already on the phone, has all of my stored books on it.  I can read at airports, etc., without taking my iPad.  I have had no problems with A T & T, as some reviewers had mentioned.  I easily load Aps on my phone.  I am still learning about my phone but do enjoy many of its special features.  Amazon, thank you for moving me into the 21st Century!!<br/><br/>P.S.-Perhaps some of  the iPhone 6 buyers should have bought the Amazon Fire phone!
wish i had never bought these phones, feeling stuck with it now.  too many issues with sound, ringers.  mayday was less than helpful.
A little bit confusing at first but a hellova phone.
Fun at first, very glitchy and doesn't update enough
Take your I-s*** and jump in a port-a-potty. This phone tops Any thing apple has to offer. It is hands down the BEST phone out there period.<br/>Wait till you see the 3d screen, when a three moves and levees start to fall. Help from a REAL person is at your hands 24-7-365 at no coast to you. What's that Apple, you can't keep up ? Too bad if you got stuck with an I-s*** phone. I-don't care. You just wasted your money. And then there's PRIME. HA HA take that APPLE eaters. I-PHome at the mouth, to think my Wife and daughter have an I-s***. But that is about to change. My wife is getting my Daughter,an ALL my friends are getting one. Thank Amazon, for opening my I-s
I have never felt so ripped off and pissed off in all my life.  This phone is worthless to me, can't even get the alarm clock to work properly not to mention the other things it has failed to perform.  I am going back to the AT&T; store to return this piece of crap after I go to walmart and purchase a phone without a contract. My two week return window has already passed but I do not intend to keep this phone in my life another day so I will just leave it on the counter and they can sue me for the $650.
I love the Amazon Fire Phone its very light user friendly and it has all the apps books and movies which is awesome thanks Amazon
Installed Next Launcher on my Galaxy Note 3 and although it does not look as cool as the Dynamic Perspective, it does look pretty neat.<br/>Seriously, this phone is expensive, so is my Note 3, then turn off Dynamic Perspective to save some battery and what will you get? Nothing out of the ordinary, battery hungry and very expensive!<br/>I knew it was going to be as a Kindle Fire HD with phone capabilities, but I was not expecting it to be so restricted.<br/>No Google Play Services means that none of the apps I paid for can be downloaded onto this phone.<br/>It was a good idea, in paper the specs sheet made me think it could compete against my Note 3, but in practice, I will keep using Amazon Services such as Prime and the Kindle and Audible apps that I can get for Android from the Google Play Store.<br/>Maybe the Fire Phone 2nd Gen will be a better option, specially if it is fully unlocked, not unlocked but locked.<br/>Galaxy Note 4 coming soon! Iphone 6 also for the Apple followers :D<br/>Amazon phones? If you are new to smartphones and can stand AT & T, go for it! Remember you have a 14 day return policy, don't drop the box so soon!
No screenshots and the sound isn't all that great.
Amazon chooses to power the cloud storage using fossils fuels (dirty energy) sources. Since Apple uses 100% renewable energy sources to power its cloud storage, certainly Amazon could do the same. Storing data, photos, music, etc. should not involve putting our health at risk and worsening our planet's current pollution and climate problems. Amazon - show responsibility for the future instead of being mired in the past with fossil fuels.
Awesome but not very many apps u can get and slow
Love this phone haven't had a bad experience yet.
Misfire! I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.
I am one those technically challenged  and read many review before buying the Fire Phone.  I must say I am very disappointed,  The battery life is terrible.  I have to recharge the battery at least twice a day.  And then to find out today I have to pay an additional $20. for storage. AT & T is gouging us. If you can find the tooted Mayday icon you are better than I am.  Sadly, I think you can do better.
I don't own the phone.  I just hate Greenpeace.  5 STARS FOR HATING GREENPEACE!!!!!!!!!
Battery so bad ,always price down $600  $ 205 $ $165 $ 145 $135 $125 $$110 , that mean this fire phone too worse .
Didn't Light My Fire ... I think it’s completely unnecessary that many of the Fire's key features, like unlimited cloud photo storage, are supported by Amazon's data centers that are powered by coal and other dirty energy. If Amazon matched competitors like Apple by powering their operations with clean and renewable energy, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.
Fire is a mistake. You are using a non renewable energy source to power it. It gets a ONE STAR from me until it matches competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power your cloud.
Great easy to use phone

What's the difference from buying this phone for $449  or the unlocked version  for $189  Besides the cost
Very good having trouble connecting to net
Great and fun to use!  The camera is sooo great and the apps are wow wow wow!  The support called Asurion is by far the best!  Not to mention a free year of prime with Amazon so you can order there and deliver for FREE!  yay team of att and amazon!

I don't like this phone it freezes up all the time.
I, like many other reviewers, wanted to love this phone. I will say the things it can do, it does an amazing job at. However, there are a very limited amount of things it can do. I think I counted 5. It is suppose to be compared to the iphone, but you really cannot compare these too. The iphone definitely has a lot more options and to be the same price as this phone, its obvious why everyone continues to go with the iphone. I shattered my phone yesterday and had hoped I would be offered something better than having to buy a new phone. Offering people better options with replacement would be something that would completely blow the iphone out of the water, since they offer about the same thing. I had so hoped you would have offered me something amazing, I was going to spread the generosity in the reviews, on my social media, and pretty much anyone who would listened.
Amazon fire phone needs a more open architecture to standard Android apps
Didn't Light My Fire ... I think it’s completely unnecessary that many of the Fire's key features, like unlimited cloud photo storage, are supported by Amazon's data centers that ...<br/>are powered by coal and other dirty energy.<br/>If Amazon matched competitors like Apple by powering their operations with clean and renewable energy, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review ...<br/>BECAUSE I CARE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT, THE PLANET, ITS RESOURCES THAT I ALL NEED TO KEEP ON LIVING ...
My touch screen keeps freezing. I have had to factory reset multiple times and warranty replace once already & in the process for a second time. Very unhappy with this phone. Wish I still had my Samsung
Ok so here it goes I've had for month I like the phone! So why 2 stars, you ask? Glitches glitches glitches, Facebook for example, if I look at a photo from friends page, bam STUCK tart, jumps off my WiFi, rrrr and some times if listening to music if I turn off. When I try to turn it will not it wants to play prime!! Would be nice if we could get an update, and some of these things would get fixed it is quite activating.
Loved the phone, but my apps would not work right. Ended up returning it
It's ok phone now that it dropped to $1.00, it's just a phone that allows you to text and call and even that sometimes it messes up. I have encountered missed called and text which didn't happens with the Iphone or at least not as much. It crashes and needs to restart it. Does not have many apps not even the big banks, can't even set biweekly reminders. Not impressed the 3d effect I like and the tilt menus are cool.
Doesn't have access to 99% of my apps. Had to return it when I was excited to get it
It’s time to put out the Fire! It makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud is not a strong selling point, especially when competitors like Apple are using 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon can commit to using modern energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review. Rad.
Nice phone but the apps suck.
First smart phone. I love it.
It's amazing, so easy to maneuver!
It is amazing!
This phone sucks. Virtually no signal in my neighborhood despite other AT&T; phones getting good signal here.  Email and SMS applications are basic and very immature / undeveloped.  Battery life is also bad.  Voice control not great either. Can't even use it to set a timer.<br/><br/>Update: the phone still sucks. Virtually all major apps you might want are not available. I love Amazon and buy almost everything through them but this Fire Phone is incredibly disappointing.
I love it, its very user friendly
This phone is a DATA puller, it used 1GB daily just to update the FIRE updates, if you don't have Wi-fi available 24/7 this phone will cost you TOO much unless you have UNLIMITED DATA plans.<br/><br/>You can't replace battery, cannot install SD card, or control any of the automatic FIRE updates, you are at the mercy of your phone!<br/><br/>BUYER Be informed before you purchase this item!
I am not happy with this phone. It is very hard to navigate and you cannot get half of the app's that other phones can. I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone.
Bought the phone for my Aunt. The phones features are good. The issue I had is she picked up the phone to answer it and the back of the phone cracked. I used the mayday feature to ask what could be done. They stated that it only had a 30 Day warranty on it. I can see if it was drop but the phone is just 60 days old. Insurance deductible is 200.00 on the phone. Makes me never want to purchase a amazon made product again.<br/><br/>Update: Amazon stepped in and made it right. I love this company for that reason.
Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. I am upset that one of the Fire’s key features, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, comes with a hidden and harmful cost. Unlike Apple and Google who have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s data centers are powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary.
Nice phone,but bad service
Amazon’s cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal and gas.. Storing our photos, music and messages shouldn’t mean we are forced to damage the health of our climate and communities.<br/><br/>Apple, Facebook, and Google have figured out how to store our photos and music with renewable energy, and so can Amazon!
Won't judge the hardware but the spectrum. Making phones in the year 2014 where its not compatible with all GSM carriers, yet the fact it is GSM is redundant. I'm tired of the US Government sham of FCC allowing corporations to have exclusivity with handsets. Maybe certain price exclusive, but tech exclusive is inappropriate. People won't even buy this because AT&T; has no unlimited data, Verizon doesn't either but those with the option of unlocked with their unlimited plan can't even take advantage. I have T-Mobile, I have unlimited everything; this would've been a great pair but Amazon fell for a dumb exclusive deal like everyone else. No 1700Mhz AWS bands renders this devices useless, albeit able to be set on fire.
Well, I began using this as a replacement for my iPhone...not.  I am truly disappointed, and have decided to continue to use my iPhone, though I will still have to pay for using the FirePhone for 2 years.  I will use it for a back up, but before you switch from whatever phone you may be using, try the fire first, before you sign a 2 year contract.  The things I do not like about it are:  No voice search, the Apps  for the phone are just not there...I can't even get my coveted taxi app.  The sound is inferior to the iPhone's (5)  I would willingly give it away if someone wanted to take over my AT&T; contract.  Guess I am an avid Apple person, however, I love my Kindle.
It's great more then, I ever through. It's amazing.
On my 21st birthday, i bought this phone.  it was a tough choice between the Amazon Fire Phone or the Samsung Galaxy S5.  I had the S4 and simply loved the phone.  I had heard good things about the fire phone and loved Amazon instant and having prime for a year.  The salesman enticed me with all the good features of the phone.  Didn't mention that you can't have most of the apps you want.  I took a risk on a brand new phone and it resulted in disappointment. I constantly have internet issues, and the Swype tends to mess up a lot.  Typing this was quite troublesome.  All in all I wish I had gone with the Galaxy S5
I was very disappointed in the amount of available apps that I currently use on my iPhone.  That's why I decided to send the phone back.
I am a die hard Amazon and Amazon Prime fan but a I am disappointed in this phone. Right now I prefer the android system. Maybe in the future Amazon will catch up but now there system really lacks.I believe they are and will work on this but for now it is not up to par.
blah
Good
I tried to like this phone but I have given up.  The subset of applications available to the fire is just not comprehensive to my needs and I don't have time to wait for development.  A note here that Amazon will take the return ATT will raise a stink after 14 days.
Battery life is worse than my 1999 Motorola.  The touch screen isn't as precise as the iPhone.  I want my iPhone back.
Cuz I can't get play store on the fire phone !!
My Daughter loves it
I can not get apps that I use on a daily basis like GeoQpons, Cartwheel, Drop box to name a few. Every time I try to use firefly it says it can't identify the song.<br/>The good, it works as a phone. The camera is nice. The battery life is awesome.<br/>Overall, I'm disappointed, but not to the point that I want to return it.<br/>The free year of Prime is sweet. But none of the tv shows or movies are free. The two day shipping is a plus and the reduced prices on certain items is nice also.<br/>This review is a little disconnected, but I hope I made my point.
I'm new to smart phones.  This one is awsome.
Battery doesn't last a day. Phone gets hot quickly, way overpriced. Cannot get it to sync with kindle fire.
Using dirty coal instead of renewables.  P.U.
So far so good. I will continue to update this review as time goes on. I am sure as with all the new phone the issues will start. The real ratting will be with the customer service and the degree or severity of the issue. We'll see.
I love this phone. It does everything they said it would do. I wish it got a little better service.
only need snapchat

Energy Performance?  Bezos, come clean.
Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. I am upset that one of the Fire’s key features, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, comes with a hidden and harmful cost. Unlike Apple and Google who have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s data centers are powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary<br/><br/>C'mon Amazon; join the fight against climate change.
A very poor effort - not using any forward thinking technology at all. The Fire is actually a misfire, bigtime! I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.
Very disappointed that a lot of the apps I use are not available in the Amazon app store.

This is the worst phone I have ever owned. I don't get a signal anywhere and hate it.
I love this phone! It looks so cool.

Everything it was cracked up to be.
Could be a little easier to maneuver

Terrible phone!
This food is a data hog and I am willing to sell it to the highest bidder.
My first smartphone so far so good.
I saved to buy this phone because I really liked it.  I even went with AT&T; for the two years. ( Bit the bullet).  The charges were horrendous the first month.  Hopefully they will get back to normal next month.  I do not get service crossing the desert for some reason. I am really upset that this phone is going for 99cents with 1 year of prime.  Is that how you treat good loyal customers??  Looks like even at 99 cents people are turning them down because of AT&T.;  Never again.  AT&T; is terrible.  Amazon  turned down my first review because I was too honest, oops I used a curse word in the first one.  I'll see is this one goes through,<br/><br/>UPDATE:  I called Amazon and requested a refund.  They were very straight forward and gave me a refund for my phone.  I tend to leap before I look and am apologizing to Amazon for my bad treatment.  However AT&T; I will not apologize.  I am stuck with them for two years and hope Amazon makes a change and opens it up.  Thanks Amazon!

Personally, I would not recommend this phone to anyway that LOVES Starbucks. I was extremely excited when the advertisements show the Space Needle in Seattle on their maps. I thought that they would have the ability to have the most important app to many of us Washingtonians STARBUCKS! After trying to download any starbucks app on my fire phone I finally contacted the Amazon team through email. They wrote back informing me my phone does not have the ability of getting the Starbucks app. I took a gamble with this phone in the first place loving Android programs. So far I have been very dissatisfied. The graphics is the only truly amazing thing about this phone. I give them the three stars based solely on the graphics. Map is WONDERFUL! Rest of the phone is not good. I would rather have an IPhone and I do not even like Apple very much pass the iPod. I should of waited a few months until they figured out how to get more apps on this phone.

Learning curve is right. I'm still not convinced I like it more than my s3. The whole apps thing is really bugging me. Severely lacking, especially when Google Play used to be the Amazon app store from what I've been told from those who were android users before I switched from an iPhone. The UI isn't all that pleasing especially with text messaging.  There's a lot of guessing and not a whole lot of guidance. I hate that I can't go into my missed call list and send someone a text msg or choose to call them back like on the Samsung. Or reject the call with a text. The browser is bizarre. I'm still working on figuring it out. I wish someone would go ahead and figure out the tricks like screenshotting and closing all apps etc like on Apple and Samsung. I'm a slave to those brands, what can I say? I'm trying to give it a chance though. I wish it would light up when I got a message too!
I purchased this phone for my daughter last week through our local AT&T.;  My daughter was very excited as this phone comes with all sorts of bells and whistles.  The speech to text works really well (better than my Samsung Galaxy 4) and the images are crystal clear.  The phone itself is great.  The problem is it can only be used with AT&T.;  We live out in the country and AT&T; does not seem to work to well out where we live.  I have seen my daughter walking around the house trying to get a signal so she can send a text. She has missed several calls and now sounds like the old Verizon guy "can you hear me now"?  If I could switch this to Verizon (as I know they work where I live) I would and I would change the rating.  As I cannot have the phone without AT&T;, I feel the service is part of the phone.  Great if you are in an area where AT&T; is easy to use.
Check the apps you need before purchasing. I use Uber and Lyft and neither of these apps are available for the fire. Now after dropping the money and entering  the contract, I can't use  these apps anymore.<br/> The technical aspects of the phone are well covered by reviews.  Just a word of warning. This is a new platform and app support will be sketchy.
not another overpriced phone
Still not impressed.  I was so excited, because I am an Amazon fan... and despite the early reviews, I adopted as I have owned every Amazon product out there.  (I am also an Apple Guy)....In all the reviews I read it said the product reminds them of something from 2012.  I would tend to agree.  There are a few things I enjoyed, but as a replacement phone, NO way.. You are not there yet. I am a techno geek, and I have 5 phones... no reason why... I just like to test all technology.  I have iPhones, Samsung note 3 and 5S.. and a Nokia... I understand you are new to this market, but if you want to be a player, reduce price and add real features that are relevant.  (for instance, how can Delta not be an app that you would have)...Can I return until you sort all this stuff out?
Can't believe amazon dropped the price to 99 cents. Paid over $200.00 on the pre order, what a rip off.<br/>Where's our refunds ?
Great Phone!
Worst Smartphone on the market:( Do not buy!! I have a Kindle Fire HD (2nd Gen) and love it. When the fire phone came out I was excited and ordered one. First one I received was broken, thanks amazon, then the 2nd one had issues too, so I got a 3rd one and was working well but it was a horrible smart phone the kindle fire he (2nd Gen) is so much better and faster than this piece of crap. So hating the smartphone after 2 weeks that one died so I just returned the piece of junk. Amazon has made it in the tablet market, but it's not looking good for them in the smartphone market.
well for the amount of conspiracy nut jobs I am seeing here and the other half paid by the Chinese spamming companies to cry about Amazon's cloud running on dirty energy and rating this product 1 star I decided to do a full start.<br/><br/>I am in full support for dirty energy because I love to see liberals cry. If dirty energy makes liberals cry then so be it lets do it!!
I'm sorry but I hate the fire phone the one you sent me wouldn't even turn on for a while and wouldn't let me turn up the volume
Nice concept but way to expensive for the release version they should have taken a loss on this one by selling them for $200&$300 without contract and they would have made it a pot better.... Too expensive for a bet on a phone and amazon has taken the loss...with over $80 mil in excited as phones accruing dust....
This phone is the best I have ever had. Dont listen to bad reviews. This phone is exellent. Again great product from amazon
Many of the Fire's key features (like unlimited cloud photo storage) are supported by Amazon's data centers that are powered by coal and other dirty energy. Competitors like Apple power their operations with clean and renewable energy - maybe if Amazon got with the times and did the same, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review. The Amazon Fire’s reliance on dirty energy is not cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary. It's contributing to the destruction of our health and environment. That's a high price to pay and one I'm not willing to support. Clean up your act, Amazon!
ENJOYING IT
Great phone
Great phone
I haven't been able to get apps that are important to me. It doesn't scan. If I'm not near it when I'm notified I have an IM from an app, like Facebook or yahoo, I don't know it without opening the app. I was told it has Google apps but it doesn't, it had its own app store. If I could trade it I would.
I'd give this zero stars if possible due to the fact that Amazon insists on running its cloud storage using dirty energy, unlike Apple and a much better iPhone and iPad. The other reason is the Fire is mainly configured to be a buying device for Amazon's stores first and foremost. Not a terribly honest effort on Amazon's behalf...that and the fact that they routinely refuse to divulge the most basic of sales fgures like a gang of mobsters makes them so undeserving of our business.<br/><br/>Shape up, Amazon...maybe you'll get more business from me!
As a former I-Phone user this phone is very different.  I switched because of the great deal Amazon offered on the phone (and I didn't have to change providers).  The phone does not react to swiping as effectively as I'm used to; it takes more time waiting for Google to respond to requests.  There are too many steps to make a phone call to a contact, even a VIP contacts; find the contact, then hit call, be careful not to touch text or you have to go back to the contact, and hit call.  But before all that you have to swipe your contact list for VIPs, IF you get your VIPs on the first swipe good for you!  I hope I didn't make a mistake.
Software was clearly rushed, zero tech support from both AT&T; and Amazon. Community college students learning to program in C do better debugging than the software engineers that worked on this obviously rushed to market product. When it randomly stops accepting incoming texts just do a factory reset, AT&T; tech support doesn't know anything about this phone, and the mayday operator seemed like she was reading out of a troubleshooting guide. Should have stuck with my Motorola androids, had them for 4 years with no issues.
I absolutely hate this phone. I want my money back. I swear Amazon owes me for having to put up with this piece of crap.<br/>I'd rather have my 1997 Nokia than this p.o.s.<br/>It glitches. YouTube doesn't work right. Half the amazon apps "aren't compatible".<br/>It randomly calls people at 4 am.<br/><br/>You like Google? Ha, f u...because nothing Google will work. You like Facebook? Good, because that's the only app that will work correctly.<br/><br/>Whoever created this phone needs to do the world a favor...quit Amazon, never ever build another phone and get a job at Starbucks because you suck.
My son loves his Fire.
Love it!!!
Still learning all the Fire phone is capable of.
not a good phone it does not hook to wi-fi there for using up data,battery power is used up way to quick
I absolutely love my fire phone. The only thing I don't like is that I can't download some apps theiinvolve Google. How ever the satisfaction of the mayday is horrible. They are nice and very helpful. But when I called in a few times to replace my phone because it was running slow performance wise, they refused to issue me a new one even though I have a year warranty. And than my screen cracked when I sat it on the table with my case. Again I called mayday and they didn't want to help me. I was disappointed because I love my phone and it has so many pictures I just can't give up
It’s time to put out the Fire! It makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud is not a strong selling point, especially when competitors like Apple are using 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon can commit to using modern energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.

Pre ordered my Amazon Fire phone and was so excited when it arrived. Set it all up and then tried to install my apps that I like to use. BUT... they would not install they were not supported by the device. Hit Mayday and was told that they were currently working with some of the developers to have some apps be compatible. I am returning the Amazon Fire phone. Will look into it in 18 months, Maybe then they will offer apps I use.
It sucked. I'm just saying. The apps were horrible. Not to mention it kept on freezing up which meant I had to keep on turning it off and then back on and the set up was kind of confusing. The only good thing about the phone was the sleek design.
I just received the phone and paid $199. I have used a Samsung S whatever for a long time. This phone is just a little hokey. It like going from a PS4 to a 360. I don't like the way you navigated through the phone. Swipe up, down side to side and then even when you don't want to. Missing a lot of apps that are normally on the android site. Battery life is about one day. Misses calls and text messages even though fully with in range and 3 bars. I am going to use this phone until the S6 comes out then give it to my daughter.
The worse functionality I can imagine.  I bought  simultaneously,  an HTC One M8 and LG Optimus G Pro.. both far superior to the Fire.  I've been using Smart Phones since they first appeared on the scene.  I just can't for the life of me figure this one out.  I think they tried to be clever with the tilting and shaking and swiping and ended up with one terrible device.
I was told I could get the apps I had on my old phone all the amazon aaps has is mainly games for kids the person selling me the phone never said that only thing Android about the phone. Is maps. And it still not as good as Google maps.
Just got the phone, but like it so far!!
This phone is too different to what I had. I'm having problems with the apps, can't do screen shots, it uses a lot of bytes; One way text with iPhone users; freezes up already. The best thing is screen size. I'm stuck with it for now.
Dirty energy. Avoid this phone!

No customization, only amazon apps, no notification lights (can't tell if phone is charging, no lights showing missed calls or any notification light at all.)  Only sold in one color. Can't remove the carousel, the email app pre-installed won't allow me to view my gmail folders, no way to know if your apps are still running and using data, and no cute text emojis!!! It's does have a nice camera and the dynamic perspective is cute, but I want all the things previously mentioned more.
I LOVE THE FIRE PHONE...!!!  :-D<br/><br/>PLEASE MAKE GOOGLE VOICE, MAGICJACK, AND VONAGE MOBILE APPS AVAILABLE TO THE FIRE PHONE...!!!  ;-)<br/><br/>PLEASE MAKE ALL ANDROID APPS AVAILABLE ON THE APP STORE ASAP...!!!  :-(
I had this phone for some time now and it sucks. As soon my phone is paid off im getting a new one and if amazon makes a new fire I will not get, you can't get new games that is out and its slow. I hate the iphone but I should of got it instead of this junk of a phone. I have to reset the phone at least 2 times a week to get my texts and even with 2 bars I cant get a phone call
No the phone did not meet my expectations the battery doesn't last and when you try to turn it on by hitting the home button  the screen comes on then instantly blacks out a bunch of times before going to the lock screen
I recently (within 24 hours) picked up the Amazon Fire from my local AT&T; store after tooling around during my 2 hour visit on an iPhone 6 launch-weekend. I browsed many phones in the store, looking for one that fit my hand, fit my pocket, and fit my needs. As a man-on-the-go with work and school, I need a phone that can open and view spreadsheets (modifying is a +!), review powerpoints, sync calender events, and -- most importantly -- provide me with a platform to review any textbooks I purchase on Kindle! Now a phone with dynamic perspective and a Year of free Amazon Prime is great, and the sleek fit of this phone is just what I need. I can stick this in my jeans and whip it out without any struggling. I can run most of my apps and use all of my Amazon-based services without having to download anything extra. I CANNOT read my book on Kindle. My Amazon Fire is NOT COMPATIBLE with all Kindle books.<br/><br/>I bought this phone with one true desire in my heart -- to be able to review my text-book (which I bought from Amazon, so that I didn't have to pay the exorbitant cost of physically owning the book nor wait on a shipment) while pooping. As it turns out, my textbook "Supply Chain Management: From Vision to Implementation" is not compatible with an Amazon Fire's Kindle. It will run on any Kindle Fire, even on Kindle for iPad... but most importantly, it runs on Kindle for the Android OS. Now, I have a restock fee to pay, and a useless $439 phone until I have enough time to wait at the AT&T; store to swap my Amazon Fire for a Galaxy S5 (or whichever Android OS-running phone i care to get) so that I can review my textbook on Kindle where-ever I please.
after only 2 days it started to mess up wasn't working right couldn't even get it to turn on correctly I sent it back the same week that I got it n got a phone from att u should of got it back about two weeks ago n I have talked with other fire phone people n they sent them back cause it stopped txing stopped call could not turn it any way for it to work so I just had a phone that didn't work need a lot more work on the phone for people to b happy with it ty bye
My husband tried this phone out but ended up returning it because it didn't have a Citibank app and then some more apps he needed. I know it was the first day they released it so they may have new ones but it just made it less desirable.

The fire is everything you could ask for. Amazing. Definitely give it a 10.
Don't buy this phone. Mine freezes frequently, locks and is being a huge pain with autocorrect as I write this review. Some very simple things are impossible to do. You can't increase don't size for standard apps.  You can't use many of the apps that are common for Android. Want to keep your Google stuff? Too bad. Better like Bing.  Want satellite view on maps? Keep by your iPhone. The phone is not worth the obligation. Pass on this one.
Not happy at all!<br/>I would love to throw it out a window but it cost to much, I didn't get the 99¢ deal. Locks up. Gets hot, causing lock ups. Hard to navigate. Poor app selection. I truly wish I stayed with Galaxy. I was so spoiled and didn't know it until I got the Fire. Just not worth the headache. Can I PLEASE go back?????? It doesn't really deserve a one star but I had to..

I thought Amazon would know what they were doing but I was very wrong...this phone is a joke and the only pne laughing is Amazon..I even pre-ordered this piece of junk!  My mistake!
Wish I had of read the over 2000 1 star reviews before purchasing.<br/>Only apps available are from Amazon's App Store.  No I tune apps Google Play apps.<br/><br/>I will be returning this in the morning.  Looks like I will have to pay a restocking free to AT&T;, but oh well.
0 out of 5 stars, smart phones are used for two things internet and apps.  And with this thing you can't use Google apps, which is 90 percent of the market place.  Amazon needs to stop being a dictator and allow the ability to install Google's play store.  It clearly shows that Amazon's marketing has no clue that every one that owns a smart phone has at least one google app.
Hated it , sent two phones back within a week. All show and no substance. None of the user friendly functions of Android, forced the use silk browser--which is awful, utilitarian home screen, limited apps from the Amazon store. I went running back to Android. It also could not interface with other phones. Only thing that was good was the camera quality and the lock screen.
Amazon’s cloud data centers run on nonrenewable energy. Why should a product that is not sustainable receive more than one star?
Can be glitch and touch slow
Loved the phone but they don't have manufacture warranty like most companies had mine 4 months crack the screen to bad 450 dollars down the drain can't even get it repIred
Limited apps. No way of organizing apps on phone screen.

I found it too expensive and too difficult to use
Horrible interface app store is lacking almost anything usefull and using the built in apps like audible was a nightmare worst phone i've ever had.
A beautiful device that was extremely difficult to use!  It attempts to prohibit you from using any app from a souce other than Amazon, but can be done after several minutes of looking and using by-pass.  I returned the unit due to the difficulty using it.  A major disappointment for me, personally.
Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. I am upset that one of the Fire’s key features, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, comes with a hidden and harmful cost. Unlike Apple and Google who have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s data centers are powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary.

I am an adult user. I have had this phone since the day it came out.  I paid $199.00 and now the phone costs .99!  What's up with that for loyal Amazon users.  This was my first smart phone and I'm extremely disappointed.  The battery life is no where near what Amazon claims.  Not by a long shot.  The battery gets really, really hot! In Amazon's defense they do call it a "Fire" phone.  It has some cool features like the rotating screens with a flip of your wrist if you can get it to work.  Apparently I don't have the right moves.  Fire fly is nice when it works which for me has been about 50/50.  Doesn't like to work when pointed at my TV or stereo.  Even just touching the screen to do something does not always work on the 1st, 2nd or 3rd try.  The biggest downfall is the lack of access to the GOOD apps.  I understand Amazon is in direct competition with Apple and Google but how do they expect to compete if they don't have the popular apps? There are several I would like but are not available through Amazon. The Audible app with auto sync to my Kindle was great.  Phone fills the basic need to get email, read, shop at Amazon and get the weather.. This phone might be better suited to a first time younger user with lower expectations..
It took 2hr to activate, and within 4hr it was died from a full charge. Then when plug in car after two and a half hours it only was at 5%. Then when plugged in outlet for an three hour it was at only 63%. Then started restarting itself and not letting me do anything. So I sent it back
Phone is a bit complex. Apps available aren't that great. Phone does have a large screen, good resolution but sound is horrible.
I love my fire phone EXCEPT it doesn't have Google play so I can't get several of my favorite apps. I hope Amazon can fix this.
I love my Fire phone!! Has everything I want, but I wish it had more voice like Siri on Apple phones. All in all it is great@
Can't wait until my contract is over to get back to my iPhone.  Phone get stuck on one setting, voicemail isn't conductive I hate calling a number messages I don't like the,download aspect of prime music just load it already not a good choice for me
I find it hard to believe that unlike Amazons other competitors such as Apple, Amazon's data centres are still powered by coal and other dirty energy. Amazon has the capability to change. I would be more inclined to purchase this product and use its features if it was supported by power operations with clean and renewable energy.
The phone itself isn't bad. My biggest complaint is that the phones operating system isn't compatible with a lot of apps.
I personally like the phone. But the only thing I wish the Fire phone had was snapchat. Other than that this phone rocks!
Why the Fire is really a misfire. I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors!
Overall a pretty good phone but I don't like the lack of a home screen and how some apps you can't get for this phone.
The sound coming from the phone during phone calls was scratchy and unclear.
well I've had some problems with some glitches sometimes the screen hangs up.  Not sure I would get again
This phone is a good one but for the fact I can't download free music. So how can I download free music?
The recently released Fire phone’s major boast is its unlimited cloud data storage ... but there’s a BIG catch. Unlike Apple’s iCloud which is powered by 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power.
<br/><br/>
I agree with the previous Review.  It does run HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!  The consequence of such warming is of concern to me,  If you install a case, it may get warmer.  Does Amazon have any comments.
Amazon has decided to use filthy energy to power it's cloud. Who wants a filthy cloud?<br/><br/>Amazon, clean up your act and clean up your cloud. Google and Apple use clean renewable energy for their clouds.<br/><br/>C'mon Amazon quit making us sick.
I loved this phone and would have kept it if it had been compatible with AT&T;'s Microcell. We live in an area with very poor service and without iMessaging we really needed a booster for our home at least to receive texts. I went to purchase at AT&T; store and was told the Microcell isn't compatible yet with Amazon Fire Phone. If you rely on a booster at your house, don't get this phone. Otherwise it is great!
This phone is terrible.  It won't open certain text messages from some of my contacts, the voice contact doesn't work half the time, the web browser does not have a back button, so you have to start over.  What a disappointment for the money.
Totally Ripped Off!!!!! I bought this phone on a pre-order for close to $200. and they just screwed me by lowering the price to $0.99!!!!  There is a reason: this phone is a huge disappointment! I have had and have 6 cell phone ranging from the Galaxy Note 3, Apple 5S, Microsoft's phone and many other models. If this phone is 3D, then I don't get it. It is a poorly designed user interface that combines the worst elements of the Windows's phone, the worst of Android and some new things which don't add value. Very confusing navigation. It has a silly and not-always-working tilt feature and a terrible Maps app. In the end, it is basically a amazon point of sale device I paid $200. for! The Firefly scanning app is cool if you want to buy things non-stop from amazon, but that is not what I bought it for. I honestly thought it would be a breakthrough phone. It now sits in a drawer and I will switch the contract to another device as soon as possible: an iPhone 6 or Note 4. Stay away! I am shocked I haven't been offered a credit on the pricing dupe job. I showed great faith in amazon by ordering early before it had shipped and this is the thanks I get!
I can't use this phone because phone because of Amazon's use of dirty energy to support their cloud facilities unlike Apple that used renewable energy.  I have been a consistent customer of Amazon, but now must reassess being a customer.
Have not been impressed at all with my fire phone. Also ATT did make me aware that Amazon was responsible for the phone. Priced way too high and not compatible with a lot of things. Crimson57
The look is nice but smears very easily and its not android friendly, take some getting used to
Limited apps if switching from iPhone. Not much flexibility. Great in concept but way behind.
5 stars
The Fire could be MUCH better. I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.

I wanted to love my amazon fire phone ..really I did. I cannot use google chrome, google play ..google anything. Seriously what a waste of my money. I'll be looking for a new phone this week. I love everything else about it but without being able to use my google mail along with the other items I need daily it is pretty much just an expensive paper weight now.
I found out that dirty coal runs their factories. I am returning this phone. It has technical issues anyway.
Amazon’s Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary. Storing our photos, music and messages shouldn’t mean we are forced to damage the health of our climate and communities
Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. I am upset that one of the Fire’s key features, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, comes with a hidden and harmful cost. Unlike Apple and Google who have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s data centers are powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary.
Can't get apps that I need
Does not allow a lot of apps that I have used before and would like to continue using.
Didn't Light My Fire ... I think it’s completely unnecessary that many of the Fire's key features, like unlimited cloud photo storage, are supported by Amazon's data centers that are powered by coal and other dirty energy. If Amazon matched competitors like Apple by powering their operations with clean and renewable energy, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.

This phone doesn't have the application I need for the reason I give just two starts
Just not what I expected is nice if u shop Amazon.com other than that not impressed
Too many things that should not have been difficult were. I am returning the phone.
My friend got this fire phone. Nothing special to speak of. I like my Moto E more!
I like the phone but do not like that i cannot load my favorite apps on it.  It is no compatible with most apps.  does not enlarge font which is a big negative.
I'm still learning how to use the phone.  Not fully satisfied with this purchase.
Nice phone, big screen terrible autocorrect and could you a screen lock function.
The phone broke within 1 mth, could not hear when receiving phone calls. Called mayday numerous times, could not get anywhere. Then they have me call customer service, after being 45 min on call, she told me she will call me back, never heard, back. Bad product, bad service and a bad overall experience.
For the $$ it was far worse than any other option ATT had to offer. The reception was terrible compared to an iPhone 5. The call quality was terrible as well. Amazon customer support mentioned to me that they thought I was on speaker phone when I wasn't. No google apps. Far happier with S5 active.
concerned about Amazon Fire Phone's becoming hot once its in use for a while.
Amazon’s cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power.
Picture and sound quality is great; however, it would have been nice to know that Google apps won't work on this phone.  I can no longer access my bank's app for mobile banking.  Thanks a lot amazon!  Big Fail!  I'd give it 3 stars, but I think it's deceptive of Amazon to not disclose this.<br/><br/>After contacting Amazon and receiving no reply, my review must be edited to 1 star (zero would be more appropriate)
did not meet my expectations of amazons usual quality standards-- problems with the phone being able to send photos and problems with emails really ruined my enjoyment of this phone. the mayday feature worked great but even the person there said they had no idea what the problem with emails was and was at a complete loss with the photos. the time I spent on mayday used my entire months data plan in just a few minutes and so my probs have not been resolved. the camera btw way is first rate and the pictures are crystal clear.
Unlike Apple’s iCloud which is powered by 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power.
Amazon's Cloud services are powered by dirty energy like coal and oil.<br/>Use Apple Iphone instead, their services are powered by renewable energy.
Didn't light my fire! Smells like burning Coal and warming permafrost! Made things way to warm when I turned it on! Its a huge waste of resources!
To me the Fire Phone is for (DEDICATED) Amazon customers. It feels good in my hands and the processor is good enough to keep up with today's phones. No it does not have all the apps but that not a problem to me because I really don't use them. Dynamic perspective is such a dynamic feature for the phone and I love it. The display is very nice 720p when showing movies/tv shows. And to be  able to keep up with all my Amazon features without having to go app to app is amazing by using just a flick of the risk.
Got to usr it for a bit and found it to be better than any android phone I have worked on.<br/>The fire os is super<br/>Great job Amazon
Great phone but couldn't really accept a 24 month contract with ATT

The worst smartphone I have used.  Dynamic perspective is of no value and gets in the way.  Interface is inconsistent and confusing.<br/>Poor battery life.  Heavy.  Design is dated - looks like old LG Nexus phone.  Strongly not recommended.
Good phone for person who uses only basic stuff on a cell phone.
Has some nice features. Find other features little frustrating.
excellent
Amazon - AT&T; is a big mistake!<br/><br/>AT&T; - Fool me once shame on you! Fool me twice - Shame on me!<br/><br/>I tried to conduct a bit of due diligence prior to purchasing this phone. I spend most of my time overseas traveling, and setting up an AT&T; Plan was NOT cost effective. Like paying $4-5 a minute for local calls.<br/><br/>So, I spent an hour on the phone with an AT&T; Rep, and came away assured that I could buy the phone without a plan, and get an unlock code. WRONG!!! I purchased the phone and have since spent four frustrating days on the phone trying to get the unlock code. In the end I was told I had to set up a plan and use it for six months before they would provide an unlock code. NOT gonna happen! Particularly since I paid full price for the phone. My choice? Return the phone or use it as an extremely expensive iPod for six months or more unless someone finds a way to jailbreak the phone in the meantime.
Using dirty energy for the Cloud storage, while Amazon competitors are using clean energy.  Amazon can do better than this!
When I am using my fire Phone getting heated. I hate this one.
Loved the phone. Seamless transition from my old iphone 5 to Fire. All of the apps which I typically use to manage my personal life and work were available on the Fire. Also very impressed by dynamic perspective and Firefly.
Why would you develop a new product that uses dirty energy to power your cloud centers? Surely, amazon can do better.
Confusing to operate. Very difficult at first. Visually beautiful, but I would rate ease of operation over looks.
I think I probably gonna change back to Iphone
This phone completely sucks... I expected so much better... this is my second one in a month, since my last one crashed & it continuously crashes... if I had my way I would be able to return it for a new phone.
Please switch to clean energy for your iCloud storage.
w<br/>as advance as this phone is I cannot get it to sync with bluetooth on my vehicle, very aggravating
Looks nice but missing all the apps I normally use. How could they exclude google apps when even iPhone does not? Do they not realize how useful goole stuff is on a mobile phone like the hangouts app.
Awesome!!  I like it so much more than my old Iphone.
I love this phone! It has everything I need. A great purchase and I would recommend it to everyone!
I went out and purchased this phone at AT&T; the day it came out. I have had no issues with it so far, and find the extra Amazon.com features to be a superb addition to the smartphone family. Firefly, Kindle Books, and all the extras that come with a Prime membership are at my fingertips. The limited app store is a bit of an issue for some, but it does have a lot of good apps through the Amazon.com app store. If you want more, try using the internet and ask them how you can do it. I know a couple people who have done it already, and they are reporting no issues with compatibility. Just a suggestion.<br/>Good job Amazon, for another great device! Glad I upgraded.
I'm not fully satisfied with my phone it is very difficult. I'm going to exchange it soon as I can because I'm very unhappy with me n my mother we have went through so much trying to get something we're please with wish I have know it was this difficult before I got it. Not Satisfied @All don t wanted trying to get something I'm satisfied with

I would never use a phone who's company uses DIRTY ENERGY so supply its cloud storage!!!

Clean up your act Amazon, or lose me, and all of my friends, family and social media communities as a customer.
I am on my second Fire phone. I have had this one week. I have had contacts disappear for no reason. I have phone numbers for contacts switch around and be posted to another contact . This makes text messages very confusing as at the top of screen it will show a contact name but message comes from another contact. I can access my voice mail some times but most of the time I can, check for voice mail messages. Some time to access an Icon I have to darn neer beat the phone to death in order to get into the icon I want to access. I have had trouble when typing a text as the phone has changed fron letters to symbols on its own.  In addition I was very disappointed that  this phone does not have a blinking notification light to tell me a message is waiting for me. I would like to be able to put a screen protector on screen but have been told at ATT store that this will affect the performance of Phone. I am not a happy camper with this phone and would much rather have my Galaxcy phone back as I can't aces functions and can't count on functions being available for fast easy use. I would prefer for Amazon to take this phone back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  so That I can move on with my life.

SO COME ON AMAZON - GET WITH THE PROGRAM.
Slow to send messages.  Also phone program picture  enhancements are fuzzy not clear .  Dealing with it because of prime membership and owning a kindle fire hex . But definitely not as easy as the IPhone ....  I love taking pictures , even the upload to Facebook or messages is not as easy
Not the best phone on the market, I've only had it a month and I want to upgrade.
GOOD! functioning fast! highly recommended!
ive tried the phone and i liked it .<br/><br/>the thing is i paid full retail price only to discover that it is also locked..... if buying it at full price or with a service plan still needs a code from AT&T; then please specify in the discreption .<br/><br/>i returend the device .... if it were unlocked this would of been my phone .<br/><br/>but locking the phone to one company is just plain bad ... AT&T;'s policy for an unlock code is very bad, you need to be a custeomr or have been one to get a code.<br/><br/>so if you have no relation with AT&T; you cant use this phone.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/><br/>i recived an unlock code from amazon ( before they released the unlocked version) and i have to say it is a complete joy to use !<br/><br/>if you like kindle and reading books this phone is for you , works great and is smooth . the customer support is flawless .<br/><br/>i choose this phone over the IP6 and samsung note 4 and im very happy with my choice and with the new price ( 199) its worth it even if you will just use it as a kindle !
The market isn't great. The phone leaves a lot to be desired. The only good things I can say about it are that the camera is pretty good. I like how easy it is to use and the prime membership that came with the phone is great. I shop on Amazon a lot so prime has been awesome.
The Amazon Fire is cheap in dollar terms. But it makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud is not a strong selling point, especially when competitors like Apple and Google are using 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon can commit to using modern energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.

Please get off of dirty energy and go renewable for your phone.
I love it--it is so much phone to discover the many facets of the phone.
Do NOT waste your money on this phone! There is very little that actually functions well. The battery is actually worse than the iPhone 5. Very sad!!!
Worst phone ever!!! I wish I never bought it! Gone through 3 replacements already and all have had major issues! Spent countless hours on the phone with mayday trying to resolve the issue and now Amazon will not even issue a refund. I would not recommended this phone to anyone!! If you are thinking about buying it spend your money on a better phone because this phone is competely not worth the price! I wouldn't even use this phone if it was free!

I thought leaving my iPhone behind was not going to be that big of a deal for me since I use very few features and could live without them. However, the change has been drastic and more noticeable than I had anticipated (as my husband laughs when I find new nuances that annoy me about this phone).<br/>1. The app store is lacking. What few apps that I can get, are not always compatible. For instance, I can get the Jawbone app, but because the operating system is not up with the times, it doesn't work. I miss the itunes app store now.<br/>2. It doesn't allow playing music through my USB hookup in my car. My iphone did this and I desperately miss this feature. So what good is having music on my phone if I can't play it? So, back to my little ipod to use in my car. Also, the apps for Pandora and other music are no good since I can't listen in my car either. I also signed up for Audiobooks subscription through amazon, but since I can't listen to them in my car, I'll be cancelling that feature as well.<br/>3. The camera isn't as good as I thought it was going to be. It boasted this wonderful camera, but no matter what I do, or how in focus I have it before I click the shutter, the pictures still end up blurry and out of focus.<br/>4. Battery life is worse on this phone than it was on my iPhone, which is so annoying. I have to make sure I have a charge handy at all times.<br/>5. The firefly technology is cool, but I've yet to actually use it.<br/>Overall, there are so many features that "could" be cool if the connectivity was there. Buying a phone first year out was probably a bad idea. Hopefully they'll get it right over the future and not be so exclusive with the apps. I realize I miss my Starbucks, Nike+, Jawbone and other apps that I used almost daily on my iPhone.

The hardware is impressive but the lack of apps (you cant download anything from Google Play) really makes it worthless.  I hope Amazon changes it policy on this - otherwise it will end up like the high end Nokia phones.  I gave up the phone big miss by Amazon on this.  Even the apps there are not smooth
Love it, love it, love it!!!!  Never been one for having to have the latest, greatest but this was a great investment!
I think part of my problem is AT&T;!

Terrible idea to use fossil fuels to power the cloud.  Amazon should know better.  Polluters!
AMAZING PHONE!! Loooooovvvvve it!!
Amazon’s cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power.
Amazon's data storage is powered by dirty fossil fuel. So it's fine to have a lot of data storage but Amazon doesn't think you'll care if your data storage needs keep Messi h up the environment.
the battery ran down too quickly
Phone is good but no enough apps
Wish I would of gotten more gb.
May day didn't work, incoming texts didn't work, pairing with my car didn't work.  In my first 6 hours with this phone, all I did was work on problems.  AT&T; tried fixing issues and had to submit requests for repairs. Next!
It freezes a lot and sometimes my keyboard will mess up
Dirty energy phone!! Stop using coal and gas to power fire phones!
I support businesses that are conscious about the environment.  The Fire could be MUCH better.I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.
I don't like the new update
It’s time to put out the Fire! It makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost: The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy like coal, gas and/or nuclear energy to power its cloud is not a strong selling point, especially when competitors like Apple are using 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon can commit to using modern energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.

too much for a dang phone. It's unreasonable.
Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. I am upset that one of the Fire’s key features, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, comes with a hidden and harmful cost. Unlike Apple and Google who have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s data centers are powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary!<br/><br/>Safe the world!!!

screen is extremely unresponsive very difficult to see with built in motion and facial tracking gigantic lack of apps supporting the phone.
Amazon should have spent less time locking this phone down to only work with their services and more time building a better product.  Not having access to any google products because google play services isn't installed makes this phone worthless.
I had high hopes for the new Fire phone and anxiously anticipated it's arrival. Unfortunately, Amazon has locked down the operating system and you're unable to use Google or Apple apps and programs. I did not realize how tethered I am to Google's app -- all my photos are stored in Google+ and Amazon's "version" of Gmail and other apps just isn't there. For the price, you should be able to use any app you want and why do you have to chose? Amazon will never be able to compete with what Apple and Google have developed from an app perspective, so why try? I returned it after only having for one day and purchased a Nexus 5. I've never been happier - no Samsung veil just pure apps and an operating system that doesn't pull any tricks.

This phone offers cloud storage that is unlimited. Cool. However, Apple and google power their cloud storage with 100% renewable energy sources. Amazon does not, nor is Amazon committed to fossil fuel free energy storage. Why buy a phone from a company that doesn't do its best to support a fossil fuel free economy.<br/><br/>For dirty energy used to power it's cloud back up Amazon gets a big fail, and 1 star
Unlike competitive phones, this one runs on earth-destructive carbon products - not renewable energy. Stay away from this one ... Come on Amazon wake up and go Green!
Why the Fire is really a misfire. I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.
Not very easy to get used to it but it is nice, not great. Bought it for. My wife who is not a techie and so she is having a hard time learning how to use it. Not happy that. I can't download apps from the Google Playstore only Amazon apps even though it is built on an Android platform. Amazon doesn't have many apps. Also not happy that I'm a prime member and have not been able to view movies with it. Have no idea how to view movies with it. Amazon, get. Your act together and let us download from Google play and also let us know how to view or download movies.
First, I have not bought the phone.  I played around with one though.  I am mainly posting this because I like amazon and I'm hoping amazon will comb through these reviews and learn from them.  So please amazon, listen up.<br/><br/>Amazon, you should release a phone with premium hardware running android OS with Google's Play Store that also has a thick amazon skin like Samsung does.  I hate Samsung's skin and bloatware but maybe you could make something better that incorporates amazon features/touches such as the firefly app.  This would allow people access to the many apps on Play Store and still gives amazon their own style.  I know you want people to use your appstore so you have more control/revenue over it but that's not going to happen.  Microsoft has been trying for a long time and has had no success.  They have way more cash flow than you so I think you should consider doing a android OS with a amazon skin.<br/><br/>Firefly is cool and should be integrated as well.  The dynamic perspective is cool but should only be integrated if it doesn't bring the cost up too much.  I guessing you lowered the hardware specs because the four cameras on the front brought the cost up so much.  So dynamic perspective may or may not be worth the effort if it raises the price.  I know I wouldn't spend extra for it.<br/><br/>Oh, and have it on all carriers.  I know you did At&t; because you wanted At&t; to advertise it but if you have a s***ty phone, no advertising is going to save you.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/>1. Bring it to all carriers<br/>2. Have Google Play Store with a thick amazon skin (ie Firefly incorporated in skin and amazon touches)<br/>3. Firefly = good job and keep it<br/>4. Dynamic Perspective = cool but if its what's causing the expensive price, dump it.<br/>5. Premium hardware = Don't expect me to pay a premium price for outdated hardware<br/><br/>Then, you might have a decent phone I, and hopefully other people, would be interested in.
Didn't Light My Fire ...

need lots of imrovement. i am amazon fan but this phone needs lots of improvement. you can get better phone with the same price. need to add lots of apps like starbucks, tango lorex security this apps id day to day use it is essintial. the touch screen some time sticks and make me made as this is not good for work. keyboard only english you have to go back for setup to change language the after you finish you go back to set up to go back to english this is not good for bussiness. not other options with the key board. battery life is bad not even a 8 hrs.
I want rentable energy used in all my products!
See Greenpeace!

Its not what i expect
super cool for video loving people.
This phone is garbage. My galaxy note was ten times better
Camera doesn't work
Could use a screen shot function.
OK, I admit it. I'm a gadget freak with a serious Amazon habit. Pre-ordered my Fire Phone and got it on the 24th. The 3-D, Firefly and scroll/tilt are pretty cool and the access to my books, videos, previous transferable apps from tablet is great. The added year of Prime is nice. Email and Browser OK, but the friggin' keyboard is driving me nuts. I want my Swiftkey app!!!! Jury is still out. My Galaxy S5 (work phone) still better. But, Fire is new and I used the Mayday function to add my comments and critique. They're adding apps and functionality, they say. If I can't get a customizable keyboard, adjustable font size and/or Swiftkey within a month though, the Fire Phone is going in my Drawer of Failed Gadgets and I'll get another S5. Sorry Amazon, love ya, but the Fire Phone ain't cutting it yet.
Flop! Can't get many apps (I.e. GroupMe, YP, LIFE Leadership/Rascal Radio, etc). Screen... easily cracked.  BEST ADVANTAGE IS you'll get one year of Amazon Prime free!!!!
A lot going on with phone worth having graphics are gr8
I won't even consider buying this phone because your data centers are fueled by fossil fuels.  Please start powering your data centers with safe, renewable energy.
The Fire's key features, like unlimited cloud photo storage, need Amazon's data centers that are powered by coal and other dirty energy. Apple's data centers are powered by 100% renewable energy.<br/><br/>Enough with the fossil fuel burning, climate change and carbon release!!!!

I have not tried the Fire Phone, but the Amazon "Cloud" where it's data is stored is powered by dirty fossil fuels and nuclear energy. After Amazon commits to powering their "Cloud" with clean renewable energy, I will consider using the Amazon Fire Phone.
Unlike Apple’s iCloud which is powered by 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power.

The reviews don't do this phone justice. It's the first generation firephone. So it won't be perfect. But it's the start of something great.

I absolutely Detest this Amazon FIRE Crap Phone. I am on my 2nd phone as it keeps Crashing, with a blank screen. Amazon wants to send me another phone (this will be number 3 in as many months-Aug, Sept and now Oct) Whatever! Amazon fix the glitch!  If you want to continue sending me a phone  every month then do so!!!! I asked Amazon to just refund my money to AT&T; so that I can get a new phone that will work appropriately. It is very disappointing that Amazon has released this RUBBISH Fire Phone !!!!. I want the Appstore to have equivalent Apps to Google Play or even Apple Apps Store- Please do so Amazon!!! I Love Amazon , & Prime but honestly I can't stand the FIRE Phone!!
So far I am very happy with my Fire phone, unfortunately I had to return the 64GB version because It was overheating and not charging at all. When I went to AT&T; to return it and exchange it they did not have the 64GB, so I had to buy the 32GB. I think when something  like this happens AT&T; should waive the repacking fee of $35. Other than that the phone has met my expectations.

Where is the back button?
very short battery life , needs charging several times a day-very limited app selection-no manual was provided with phone
battery life is terrible
Horrible phone
I pre-ordered two of these phones (one for myself & one for my wife) shortly after they were announced by Amazon.  The phones seem to work fine so far, but less than two months after I received mine, Amazon has dropped the price from $199 each to $0.99 each.  So I'm out nearly $400 just for being one of the people who took a chance on a new product from Amazon.  I can't help but feel that I was burned by Amazon for being one of their early adopters.  On other products like movies & books, they offer a pre-order price guarantee so that you can feel confident that you won't be overcharged for something that is available for less after you have placed your pre-order.  Why doesn't Amazon offer something similar to their loyal customers who took a chance on their new Fire phone?  Why punish the very people who helped to make the initial launch of a new product successful?  I would think that a company would want to keep their early adopters happy so that they would be there next time to support the launch of the next new product.  I don't imagine that I will EVER want to purchase any new devices that Amazon promotes until it has been on the market for quite a while and I get to see what the price is going to do.<br/><br/>Update September 23 2014 - after posting the above review, Amazon contacted me and made it right.  I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised by the very quick response.  It just goes to show that Amazon really does care about their customers and wants them to be satisfied.  I'm back to being a very happy Amazon customer again.  Thanks, Amazon!
Dirty energy runs this cloud storage, no excuse for that with a company this bi.  I wonder about audible?
The New Amazon Fire Phone is Amazing!
The energy sources for Amazon Fire are damaging to our environment and therefore unacceptable to me.
Amazon's data centers are powered by dirty coal and hydrofracked gas!  Put forth clean, renewable energy effort like<br/><br/>Apple and I would give Amazon Fire a 5!
worthless smart phone
Good
Sounds like a great phone...too bad it relies on dirty energy. Apple and Google have already committed to renewable energy....Amazon, what are you waiting for?
How come Apple and Google can power their operations with renewable energy but Amazon can't?
Unlike Apple’s iCloud which is powered by 100% renewable energy,  Amazon’s cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power.
not easy to operate
Great phone - could be better though.<br/><br/>I have what would make this the game changer it was intended to be.  If they would just get off their high horses (already fallen off), and contact me.<br/><br/>I have attempted to contact them.  They should take heed to what I have to offer, and make this the easy choice for anyone between the ages of 8 - 90 years old.  This could be the game changer it was intended to be.<br/><br/>Perhaps they will contact me?  Get off those high horses and let's make this the game changer it was intended to be  - could be absolutely HUGE!!<br/><br/>In the Billions kinda HUGE . . .<br/><br/>We will see, . . Still an outstanding super good phone and better than the iPhone 6 - which my son has.

The phone is garbage.  Very buggy interface.  You definately won't like it if you're coming from an iphone or samsung.  I've had both brands in the past is this one feels like a huge step backworks.  The interface is clunky (actually worse than the kindle fire believe it or not), buttons are tiny and any normal size hand will have difficulty.  I can only imagine how women with nails will struggle.  Save yourself a headache and move on.
This was not for me at all. I returned the phone. Most of the fun popular games cannot be played on this phone because the Amazon store does not offer them. Notifications, such as Facebook were nonexistent. Their were no apps for cool ring tones, just had to use what was already there. There was no snapchat as well as many other popular apps.  The coolest thing about this phone was the camera. It is a 13 mega pixel and worked well.
It is a nice phone
This phone runs on dirty energy and should be avoided by conscientious consumers.
Cloud storage data centers do use use renewable energy, like google and apple
I am appalled at the roll-out of the fire phone. It is not all that. You can not compare it to anything else out in the market. I have heard nothing but disappointment in your product. I was going to purchase one, but since have decided not to.
To glitchy
Please clean up your act and switch to clean energy to fuel your phones.  I love Amazon, but this is wrong.  You can follow Google, Apple and Facebook's lead and use alternative energy.  Thank you!
Why isn't this powered by 100% renewable energy like Apple’s iCloud??? Amazon should be more environmentally responsible. As a corporate giant, they could make a world of positive difference instead of continuing to use dirty energy. If you buy this phone, you are contributing to a polluted world.
I hate it because we never ordered it. Amazon did take it back, but I almost cancelled my subscription after this nonsense. Sorry Amazon created a trash phone no one wanted and got stuck with millions of them, but did you really think I wouldn't notice the 600+ bill, or that I would fall in love with it and keep it? Poor form from an otherwise amazing company.
This phone is powered by dirty energy, and no one should buy it!
Only one star, simply because Amazon's cloud centres run on dirty energy - clean up your act Amazon !!!
Hello,<br/><br/>I got an u locked fire phone from USA. It is not working here. I have inserted the sim and the sim is showing the tower. However, I can't call or receive any call. Is there any solution for this?
Looks like there are lots of environmental engineering "experts" here. Only that copying and pasting words like "clean energy" doesn't make you appear to be loftier. If you are so enthusiastic on using "clean energy", do me a favor and do the followings:<br/>1. Stop driving gas consuming SUVs. Get an electric car instead. No, not even hybrid car which uses "dirty" energy.<br/>2. Never use furnace that burns gas. It's dirty. Always use electric heater even if they're less efficient.<br/>3. Check your cooktop and make sure it's electric.<br/>4. Where does your electricity come from? Check your power station and make sure they're not burning coal but uses nuclear power to generate electricity. If not, persuade them to switch or stop using electricity as well.<br/>5. TIP: It doesn't matter if you keep air conditioners running all day as long as they are consuming "clean" energy.<br/><br/>If you feel it necessary to mark all 1-star reviews in the current page as unhelpful, here's a quick tip:<br/><br/>1. Make sure you are on the list of reviews page.<br/>For Safari and Chrome: Right click on the webpage, and click "Inspect Elements". Then, click "Console" tab.<br/>For Firefox: Click Tools Menu -> Web Developer -> Web Console.<br/><br/>2. Copy the line below and paste into browser console:<br/><br/>jQuery('span.s_star_1_0').parent().parent().parent().find('a.noButton').click();<br/><br/>Then press Enter.<br/><br/>3. Turn to the next page of review, paste and Enter again, and repeat as long as you're willing to do so.
Unlimited cloud storage is powered by dirty coal and nuclear power. Apple's iCloud is renewable.
This phone does not have a way to delete resent calls.  this is bad because these calls can build up quite fast,  and if you have to delete them one by one what a headache.  Other wise fun phone.
Not pleased. Sound quality is awful. Phone is nearly unusable to make calls, when it actually connects. TO MAKE CALLS. Amazon apps are too limited. Amazon Instant Video quality is painfully bad. Really wish I had my iPhone back. I would recommend this phone only to someone who doesn't want something useful.
Love it!
Responses are very slow, the availability of apps is poor. I wish I had kept my iPhone.
Nothing really works well with the phone. No good apps and I don't think it's all good with the prime when you never get newer movies or music. Have 2 because of the home screen graphics.
Garbage. Phone shuts off applications in the middle of using them, even the built in amazon apps.  Have to restart the phone constantly trying to.get the map functions to work.  The approved apps in the amazon store do not work half the time on the phone.  Its good for phone calls and texting but thats about it. The firefly app is cool but thats about it.
I should say I loved it until is dropped it and the screen shattered.  I have it in the purple case with the screen cover but the did not keep it safe from a fall on a gravel parking lot.  I am very upset since my insurance will provide the replacement for $199 on a phone I just got on July 24th at 4 pm.  I only lasted 43 hours before it broke. I hope I have better luck with the replacement.<br/>I hope more apps will soon be available such as Map My Walk and Weight Watchers.
At least Samsung will be out of focus for a while, this phone looks 98% like the iPhone (the worst phone out there, iPhone that is).  If you have an android phone and have prime, ask them for a discount since the Fire Phone is also android, yet the only one that Amazon streaming video works with.
Why the Fire is really a misfire.....<br/> I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.<br/>Get with the times's amazon, dirty energy is on the out.<br/>Even the Rocker-feller's , have divested out of dirty energy and invested into Solar, wind and other clean , intelligence forms of powering our civilization!<br/>The Rockerfeller's were the original investor's of coal and oil. If they are smart enough to pull there billions out, AMAZON SHOULD TO.
199.99  was a great value.  Now it is back to 449.99  so it is now in competition with other android phones with friendlier features.<br/>Will see how long it take for them to drop the price back down, Based on the millions of units they own, they better move on the price drop quickly.
Nice phone but cumbersome UI and poor app selection. Feel like I'm being charged for everything in the store. Phone gets EXTREMELY HOT when being used. Too hot to touch on occasion. Was told by an Amazon rep that I just needed to get a case so it wouldn't bother me. I thought that was a poor answer to an overheating phone. But the heat is even coming from the front screen and the heat on the front glass makes it too hot to touch and play games.  Camera quality looks poor compared to other smartphones on the market today.
Unimpressive
Cloud data centres run on coal, gas and nuclear power?! I thought this was supposed to be progressive, cutting-edge technology.
Really not happy with this phone. I am not getting my text messages from my IPhone friends, I can't get my bank app for my mobile banking. I am just really not happy with it.
Do not buy this phone under no condition. First off you won't be able to get any app that you need. Their App store is limited and does not  have the basic apps that you will want want. Secondly, the screen is extremely susceptible to being shattered. It will fall 2 inches of the ground on a carpet and break. Stay away from this phone trust me on this. Amazon is great for most things but this phone is a disaster on many levels.
Love the phone but hate AT&T;! they will rape you on the monthly billing.  Its so bad that I am considering paying to get out of the contract and letting phone sit until they JailBREAK this phone.  If you are considering DONT DO IT YET. WAIT TILL OTHER CARRIERS HAVE IT!
Honestly I think this phone would be great. It's missing only one thing, a service provider with some coverage. Though AT&&T; says they have coverage my daughter got a plan then found that she couldn't call anywhere in the county we live in, nothing in the county (next county) where we both work. Texting was even spotty taking sometimes 10 minutes for a text to go through. Amazon you need to ditch AT&T; and get Verizon.
I opened the box and a few hours had it up and running.  So far so good.
The service with AT&T; draws down on positive reviews. I have had nothing but problems with them not to mention I had no service in Montana where we were vacationing.
Amazon's cloud data runs on dirty energy:  Coal, gas and nuclear power!
I have been so unhappy with this phone. After contacting At&t; several times, I decided to contact Amazon through the Mayday feature on the phone. Well, none of my problems were ever solved and I ended up having to return the device and get a iphone. If only Amazon would have been able to fix my problems it would have been a awesome phone!! I love Amazon Kindles and the phone if it only worked properly.
This phone is awful. While it has some cool features, it is overall a terrible phone. I have it for  3 days and am getting ready to return it. First, once you have starting a call you can not hang up.. my screen goes black and the phone will not respond. Many apps act similarly, they fail to open and the phone goes black and will not respond to anything. The camera is also terrible. Additionally, the phone is not particularly ergonomic, specifically, the main button the front is uncomfortable with sharp edges. Many of this issues are software issues, not hardware issues and will likely be worked out eventually, but for the time being do not buy this phone.
Thought about getting this till I realize it runs on dirty energy.
Using 100% unrenewable energy is no way to produce a smart phone!
I am so unhappy with this phone.  I want my money back but Amazon will not even give me a credit for the phone so I can buy one that I can actually use.  I have been told over and over again that they will be getting more apps.  They do not even have a Walmart app.  Buyer beware they say they are getting more apps everyday but I have yet to find what I have been searching for.
Hated the phone!
Got this on first day when it came out....Found out it does not have google play as app and could not download it...Only Amazon apps work with phone.
Y'all need to make sure you have a good selection of apps. I can't get grindr, jack'd, hornet, song kick, I would totally get this phone, but since none of these apps are available I will wait to get the new iPhone. I did play with he phone in the store and I did like it and tired to get those apps and they are not available. Love all the cameras though!!!
I'm not really that happy with it.  Have had other phones that were more user friendly.  Now I have to use this for 2 years.  I made a mistake.
Gave me a headache, I had to turn off dynamic perspective. The fire phone seemed slower than my iPhone. I was really put off by the horrible UI. They took android, which is already not pretty, and made it worse. It was complicated, and just all around okay. The only cool thing was the dynamic perspective, but even that after a while started to make me sick.
Produced unethically, s***ty product.
Worst phone I ever had the displeasure to have. Only paid $.99 for it, took it back and had no problem paying the $35 restock fee. Definitely not user friendly at all. As a daytrader, it would NOT SUPPORT Ameritrade. Couldn't download anything that wasn't in the Amazon store.<br/><br/>STAY AWAY FROM THIS POS PHONE!!! Absolutely 100% GARBAGE!!!
This needs to be powered by reusable energy like iphone6.
Do I need to get insurance thro AT&T;+ my phone is still not active 4days later. AT&T; has the worst customer service I have ever experienced
The app store is very disappointing
Lots of great features
Honestly I wish there was a lower rating than 1 star.  I have had this phone for a little over a month and I absolutely hate it.  I can't get hardly any apps to work, and those that do doesn't work very good.  I was so excited when this phone came out because I am a big fan of amazon, but if this had been my first experience with their brand I would never buy anything from them again.  I am counting down the months until I can get a new phone.  Do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy this phone.
You need to use remewable energy
Boo…your storage is based on fossil fuels and nuclear energy unlike Apple I-Phone whose I-Cloud storage is 100% renewal.
No it did not
I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. Apple, Facebook, and Google have figured out how to store our photos and music with renewable energy, and so can Amazon. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.
I bought this phone and not working with a new nano sim that I took it from India . I put the same sim on my Iphone it worked but not taking it in fire phone. Please help me to resolve this
WILL READ KINDLE BOOKS ALOUD.  That's right, this phone is a portable, wearable, bluetooth device that will read kindle books aloud.  That is the sole virtue.  Get this phone if you want an easy way to have your Kindle books read aloud to you.<br/><br/>I boight a cracked screen Fire Phone on ebay for almost nothing, which is the approx device value.  My "real phones"  are of course real android.  My Fire Phone will never be activated.<br/><br/>Some decent books have never been recorded in audio format.  I own 1000+ audiobooks, and sometimes I want to listen to a book w no audio version without going thru a format conversion . This device, the Fire Phone, does that nicely.<br/><br/>Apart from that, the Fire Phone has a bunch of stuff that's cool for 5 minutes and then useless to horrible.  3d is for what?  The wrist what doesn't work well, swiping doesn't work well, no back button horrible, the apps don't work as well as they do on android,  just a disaster.  Who at amazon thought this was a workable product?  Did they even try getting any customer feedback in the beta?
The Fire could be MUCH better.I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.
Sucks
Maybe the worst phone since the nokia lumia... nothing like a real android and not even half the phone that the iphone is. waste of money unless you want a phone that is stuck in 2008. operating system is slow and glitchy. camera may have a high mp but has awful low light ability and if you even move for a second while taking a video then the entire video is messed up. call quality is great in my area for at&t; and on my iphone 5 i usually get 45mbps download speeds but with this phone i barely got 3mbps. the dynamic perspective gave me a headache after 30seconds. the mayday help option is a gimmick. i would not advise anyone to buy this phone.
Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. I am upset that one of the Fire’s key features, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, comes with a hidden and harmful cost. Unlike Apple and Google who have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s data centers are powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary.

Didn't Light My Fire ... I think it’s completely unnecessary that many of the Fire's key features, like unlimited cloud photo storage, are supported by Amazon's data centers that are powered by coal and other dirty energy. If Amazon matched competitors like Apple by powering their operations with clean and renewable energy, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.

Not a happy customer at all with it ..... Personally would never get this phone again or stay with AT&T.;
Why is Amazon Cloud using dirty energy? How irresponsible?
This is the worst phone ever. I should of went with the Galaxy 4 or 5. Can't do what you can and get apps you need with Amazon apps. In a two-year contract and can't get rid of phone. Thinking about going back to my old Pantech phone.
I don't like it, kinda slow and the screen is not clear, I mean the program icon is small and so on.
Amazon is not Green. Unlike Apple, Amazon is not doing anything to reduce their carbon footprint.<br/>I cannot support this product until they make changes to reduce the energy consumption both in the Amazon cloud server farms and the company as a whole. I like Amazon but not in this way.<br/>Amazon can easily make changes to become more energy efficient, save money and become a better brand in the eyes of consumers. Let's send a message to Amazon to improve in this important area so they are more in line with their customers values.
Amazon needs a better  support system,  Mayday does not have all the answers. the phone has great features, hopefully Amazon will stand behind it.
NO BACK BUTTON!! Who's the idiot using it? It's in the same place as the S5. Don't like to swipe UP? Hit the middle button. Same User interface.
as to locked Amazon better step it up,<br/><br/>Its now a violation of the law, to NOT unlock a phone, if requested<br/><br/>so no locking to AT&T; unless they are lawbreakers<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>old news<br/><br/>time for Amazon to step it up

For such a consumer friendly and smart company, it does not make sense for you not to be a Leader for our world and clean energy.
It’s time to put out the Fire! It makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud is not a strong selling point, especially when competitors like Apple are using 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon can commit to using modern energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.

The keys for texting and e-mailing are extremely tiny, speaker is low volume. No instruction book, but mayday helped me register the phone and get started. No apps, camera is no big deal, I want to return it!
Uses dirty energy which sucks.
Haveing a little trouble  with it, and do miss the showing of the time on it. Maybe as I have it a little longer it will get better
Does not use renewable energy
Dynamic perspective gives me a headache, and this phones doesn't ensure encrypted communications like the GSK securephone does, so in a post-Snowden world, this just doesn't cut the mustard.
At this point i wouldn't even consider buying this phone.

Limited apps
Do not destroy the planet just for profit!<br/>Fire is really a misfire.

It was pretty cool when i statrted out using it however it didnt have alot of the basic apps that I need and after a few days of using it, the phone was really glitchy and things wernt functioning and i was getting frusterated. So i returned it. I think if amazon can get more apps compatible with the phone and fix come of the glitches and bug it could be a pretty good phone...its just not for me.

clean up your act
Sponsored by the CIA, powered by dirty energy. Come on Amazon, you can do better than this.

Went through two phones in one day and neither worked.  Left the store without a new phone.  Very disappointing.
Still learning how to  use apps, but it seems to be the best phone I have ever had. Thank You, Amazon!!!!!!!
I liked the phone in general. Tilt, swipe gestures are very handy. Only downside, it's heating a little bit.
Absolutely horrendous phone. Soooooooooooo glitchy. I am unimpressed. Will NOT buy another Amazon phone.
Phone is ok....just different...and it's just like an up graded iphone...with just one button..I tried changing it for galaxy but I was denied....
This phone is garbage! I am really upset that I wasted so much money on such a horrible product! Do not buy this phone! If you BUY music and download it to your device it won't play! When you call someone to fix it on Maytag they just keep transferring you! It is so frustrating because no one seems to know what they're talking about! The phone doesn't auto connect to WiFi either! You have to make sure you do it yourself everyone you need internet so you don't get charged data! The apps are always freezing and you have to keep deleting them and 're installing them for them to work! Seriously, read all the reviews before you buy this phone! It isn't worth the money! Too many problems!
Much better options out there. iPhone 6 wins in every category, processor, screen, camera, apps, etc.  I do believe that more competition and choices are always positive.<br/><br/>I'll continue to be a loyal Amazon shopper, and Prime subscriber, but returned Fire Phone for the iPhone 6 and have no regrets.
Get ready to hard reset your phone at least once per day if you buy this. Music app doesn't work, too many bugs. I'm a big Amazon fan but this phone is horrid.
Please transition data centers to clean and renewable energy sources.<br/>Thank you.
Only amazon could bring a phone like this.This one beats the Android system .The fire is super.Great connectivity.Super camera and also. Great buy.
Lets start out by saying, that if you want and android phone that you can use all your favorite apps on, don't get the Fire Phone. It is horrible. The best feature is the texting and calling feature, which you can get with a basic flip phone. The worst setting on the phone by far is the fact that they put in a "carasoul", which essentially is how you clear background apps so you can prolong your battery life. Let me tell you though, I have accidentally deleted my AmazonPrime Music app so many times after finally being able to download all my music again all because directly underneath the "Remove from Carasoul" is the "remove from device". Why on earth would you put that just below it, and let me tell you, it is not easy to just download your music again, especially when you do not have easy access to Wi-Fi.  I am appalled by this phone and do not recommend it to anyone. They do have some pretty cool features like the mayday and the firefly features but all in all I would not have gotten this phone at all if I had a chance to play around with it first.
Very disappointed that you are unable to purchase the Amazon Fire Phone without a service plan but yet it must still be utilized with an AT&T; sim card.  The entire point of purchasing a phone at such an increased price is to have the freedom to utilize the phone with any sim card you choose.

Poor battery life. Freezes up. No apps that I actually use. Disappointed. Now I have to wait 2 years.
I bought this since july. just had it open right after I came back to Kuwait. did all AT&T;'s requirements on unlocking but they said I'm not eligible!!! my friends don't even want to consider buying if i can't unlock mine. Amazon, please help me get a unlock code!
Returned after two weeks - terrible to use.
The apps are good but phone need to improve
I am so surprised to learn that this phone's unlimited cloud data storage and Amazon’s cloud data centers , unlike Apple’s iCloud which is powered by 100% renewable energy, are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power.<br/><br/>This is DEFINITELY NOT cutting edge technology, more like last century's solution.  Amazon, please live up to your reputation as a leader in the modern technology; dump the dirty energy, and apply renewable one for a better tomorrow for our future generations!!!
Why do you have to use dirty energy for your Fire phone, aptly named since dirty fuel causes extreme weather conditions, including Fire, when others use renewable technology
Limited feature compared to other family and friends phones.
The photos are above average, the interface is horrible, calls were nice and clear, dynamic perspective is a nice trick, I miss Google maps, no grindr,scruff,capitol one or trance.fm (apps I used on a weekly if not daily basis) free prime for a year is a plus but not enough for me to keep the device. It's an ok phone for amazon's first try.
Why would I want a phone that only works with the worst US carrier? This is the same mistake that Apple made when it first launched the iPhone. Repeat foolishness.
Unlike Apple’s iCloud which is powered by 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power.
The phone is OK, but the availability of apps is pathetic. Games is about all you can get. I want more practical ones like Starbucks, Cinemark, etc.
The worst phone ever. From the start I had several issues including crashing, freezing and no WIFI connectivity. Contacted customer services several times had me reset and power off phone several times. Worked for a day or two and problems persisted. Apps take 5 to 10 minutes to open, if they open at all. I used the phone as my personal phone; just on the weekends and the majority of the time I was on my business phone because Amazon phone wouldn't work. Fed up, I connected to the live chat and the customer service rep told me he only saw one bar while my iPhone had 4 to 5 bars. The rep told me to go to AT&T; and have them send the phone back. I went to At&t; and they told me tuff luck only Amazon can do something for you. I called several times and finally talked with a manager:  he explained their policy and said they would send me a new Amazon phone. I explained I didn't want another poor operating phone and he insisted that's all he could do. I just want my money back, yet they want to send me another worthless phone. Then he said I could sell the new phone on eBay. REALLY! I mentioned what a good Amazon customer I am: kindle owner, fire tv owner, Amazon Prime member for years and yearly 24 credit Audible user. Audible is owned by Amazon. Honestly, I don't know if I want to do business with Amazon anymore. Poor Customer service and another bad phone on the way. Plus $299.00 down the drain. I hope your happy Amazon screwing over your loyal customers. I guess like At&t; you have plenty of customers and can afford to lose some.
Amazon, PLEASE make it so I can use my phone as a remote for my Fire TV!
the wifi went out. tried to resolve but couldnt. got a different phone
Its to complicated...no I dont..I sent mine back

I don't know how to explain another word for love but I think this phone is awesome and I think the next type should be water proof
love  this phone
Well I really wanted to love this phone but it has some flaws first no clash of clans lol I,sure that can,be fixed but I love the glass screen procecters, unfortunately any type on screen cover on this phone will make it until useable when you have a screen protector on and make a phone call it make the screen go black ( powersave when your holding it to your face) I can't hang up can't push,numbers nothing so as of right now you can't use a screen protector that,covers the front camera
I think android apps are better, But it is okay
It's gone.  Good riddance.  We still have to live with one in the family, but my wife mostly just uses it as a phone with access to email.  We use K9 email, so pretty much any smart phone will do for her.<br/>This phone had such potential.  Too bad they did such a poor job on it.  I see that they fired a bunch of engineers.  That would be too bad since I think the engineers did a pretty good job of designing what they were told to design.  They should have fired the people who did the design concepts and decided to focus on using the phone to buy ever more stuff from Amazon.  I know Amazon is into selling stuff (I buy a lot from them) and they are into stealing legitimate sales from legitimate physical retailers, but it's a real conflict of interest to be retailing a product which is primarily focused on selling more of their own products.  I'm glad it fell on its face.  I hope they fired the right people, learn from their mistakes, and use their excellent engineering staff to design a decent smart phone for a decent price.<br/>That would mean eliminating that carousel home page.  What a pain to have to swing around a carousel when you could just have an array of icons to poke at.<br/>It would mean eliminating FireFly.<br/>It would mean including the GooglePlay store or making sure the same apps are available in the Amazon AppStore.<br/>I could go on but they won't listen and I need to get back to work.
The absolute worst phone I have ever owned. It is very difficult to navigate to your apps and find anything. Took 20 minutes just to figure out how to connect to my trucks Bluetooth. AT&T; took another 20 minutes or so just to try and get it on the network.<br/><br/>I would stick with either an Android or IPHONE and this hybrid piece of junk. If it wouldn't cost me so much I would just hit it with a hammer.
I'm not happy with this cellphone. It is missing a lot of things like store applications. Also, is very unfriendly to use.
Didn't Light My Fire ... It's unnecessary that many of the Fire's key features, like unlimited cloud photo storage, are supported by Amazon's data centers that are powered by coal and other dirty energy. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon.
I thought I loved this phone. But my heart is with Apple.
The keyboard always disappears during texting. I have to restart the phone.
its a good phone all the is good and great on the kindle fire is here also
man !!! i really love this phone !!!
Amazon needs to step up like it's competitors (eg Apple) and power it's cloud storage with green energy sources, as well as publicly  reporting company-wide energy use/carbon emissions annually along with goals for future reductions.
What a genius concept!  Take what looks like a phone and really make it a Trojan horse that leads back to all things Amazon!  Their marketing department must be so proud of their efforts to shove themselves down the public's throats.  Yes, all I want to do is buy more and more stuff, never mind that I might get the same or better deals elsewhere without having to involve Amazon.  Where would I find that?  Oh, yes, the Internet.  Not hard at all.  And let's talk about what powers the giant Amazon monster.  At least lots of other companies have put themselves on the path towards using renewable energy.  Amazon?  "NOYGDB," which probably translates into "coal."  How cyberpunk!  All those commercials with a pair of kids acting old?  That's exactly it, they want you to think of the Amazon Fire Phone as being all young and hip, and instead it's the same old crap—in this case, the worst of the same old crap.  So if you want suck at the teat of blatant commercialism just to make some soulless while folks who already have too much money even richer, all while adding to air pollution, creating toxic waste, and making the planet just that much more uninhabitable, then Amazon Fire Phone is for you.  For anyone who wants to be treated as a human being worthy of respect and not just as a way to make someone else richer, you should drop this phone as if it were on fire.
Battery life is horrible.
Can this phone be opened, for example, to replace a spent battery without spending 2 hours recharging the one in there? I moved from T-Mobile. I was in a T-Mobile store in a centrally located mall. No bars. The employee, said, go to the Food Court, turn left out the door, there should be some bars there. So I replied. I am going to the Food Court, but will turn right instead, into the Verizon store. He did not think me funny. Same problem with ATT. Because that is the only provider of this phone, that is highly relevant. Wait until available at Verizon unless you want to be walking long distances for bars.<br/><br/>Upon reading more carefully, both sides are made of glass. If migrating from Android, expect a steep learning curve.
Touch screen doesn't work very well. Overrated
This phone is supported by ancient polluting forms of electricity, coal & gas. Please commit to using clean and newable energy to power the cloud.
Terrible. Sent it back
It don't give you Google play
still trying to figure it out
Dose not have features needed
Clean up your data centers with clean energy, Amazon
Love I phone I love fire fly
Updated:  I got my Amazon Fire Phone about a week later instead since the local AT&T; store didn't have any in stock.  They had to order it since it was not in high demand at the time. It arrived at my door and I got it going by calling Amazon I think instead of the phone company.  Either way, they got me going so I could use my new phone.  I have read the reviews and articles and stuff about this phone and as for all the negative reviews and negative articles in the news as well, it's all B.S.!!!!  Do NOT listen to it.  Ignore it.  Those reviewers do not know what they are talking about, and they clearly don't own one either.  This phone is absolutely incredible.  I love it.  I say this as a former Apple phone user.  I switched from the iPhone 4s to the Amazon Fire Phone and I have NO regrets whatsoever.  I am very, very happy with my new phone.<br/><br/>I can listen to my Amazon Prime play lists and any Prime music I have to watch using the included earphone set that came with my phone.  (By the way, the earphone set really does not tangle.  The ear bud pieces themselves are magnetic so that is why they don't tangle.  You would have to purposefully and literally wrap them in such a way that they do tangle, if anything, but otherwise, they do not tangle.)  I can also search for more music as I want and add to my album collection.  I even have access to Kindle books and can search kindle books on my phone too.  I have the Unlimited Kindle service, so I take advantage of that and read books right on my Amazon Fire Phone, and I even shop around on my Amazon Fire Phone as well.  The amount of apps you get in the app store is actually incredible.  There is not much that you don't get that is available through the Apple store vs the Amazon store.  So the claim that there are no apps is absurd.  Even when I first got my phone a few months back, I had no issue with having a lack of app's.  So don't worry about that.  I love the Dynamic Perspective on my phone too.  It's really cool. No, it's not necessary, but it is really cool to have on a phone and to know that no one else has it either.  However, that CAN be turned off if you want right in your settings area, so it's no big deal to turn off.  You get free screen savers each day and they are new, so it's always very interesting to see what comes each day.  You can even take a picture of something of your own choosing and use THAT picture as your screen saver, if I am not mistaken and I don't think I am.  So, the possibilities are endless with that.  The camera feature is incredible.  I have played around with that off and on and gotten creative with some pictures I have taken of my family and had some laughs at the end result.  When shopping on the Amazon web site from the phone, you can scroll through with one hand by tilting the phone up and down.  To slow it down with the scrolling, just don't tilt down or up as much and you will see that it slows down for you.  The more tilt whether up or down, the faster it scrolls for you.  Again, another feature that is very cool, but in this case, very useful if you have a hand that is messy.  As for Amazon instant videos, no problem there either.  You get an Amazon Instant Video icon on the phone and direct access to movies for rent or purchase and you can watch right on your phone, no problems.  It is so very well worth getting this phone, but it is primarily for when you are all up in the Amazon eco-system, in my honest opinion.  I also got this phone while the Amazon Prime membership came complimentary with the phone, and as long as it is complimentary, you are good to go.  If you are already a Prime member, they add another year to your existing membership free of charge.  Anyway, I hope my review has helped others in making an informed decision.  I also hope others get this phone and enjoy just as much as I am. :)<br/><br/>Original post below:<br/>I don't have my Amazon Fire Phone yet, but all you losers who can give a review of a phone without owning one, need to get a life!  There are millions of other things to worry about besides what Amazon Fire Phone runs on or is made of.  I can't wait to get mine Wednesday, because it's cost efficient, and it is BY AMAZON.  The generation that is writing these reviews without owning a Fire Phone, needs to quit being so sensitive!  The next thing you are probably going to be saying, is that queers are ok, and God does not exist!  People worry about your own ass!  Amazon has done nothing to offend you.
Absolutely unique. Love love love it!
Not so good, disappointment
I have had my fire phone a little over 24 hours  and it sucks, I can not download any of my books from my kindle account , the mayday personnel although very friendly are no help. When connected to my wifi at home it keeps disconnecting and having to going to contacts every time I want to call my wife even if  she was the last number I dialed is crazy. I had such high hope now only disappointment.
Horrible apps close it never works
Horrible phone..... worse than my Galaxy S2 from 5 years ago
Not what I expected
Extremely disappointing.  The moving screen got old.  Could not find most of the apps I had on my iPhone.  It would not let me load my banking app.  I tried for 3 months to like this phone as I really love Amazon Prime, but I went back to iPhone and have been happy ever since.  I would not suggest this phone to anyone else.
Maybe if they used clean renewable energy sources like Apple I would buy one
WORST PHONE EVER. It restarts randomly. I dont even have to touch it and it restarts. Then it wont turn back on. I MISSED A VERY IMPORTANT EXAM MEETING BECAUSE OF THIS DAMN PHONE!!! There is nothing else to say. There are countless things that suck about this phone. Dont waist your money on it. I prefer androids anyway. Dont waits $200 on this load of S***! By the way, because of your s*** phone, I lost so much money, and my life may be ruined by the cause. There was SO MUCH AT STEAK!! IM SO ANGRY YOU HAVE NO IDEA!!!
I am returning this phone to the at&t; store today after only a week of use.  I need to be able to do many things on my phone on the go. the app store is extremely limited and the apps I need are not avail. When spending this much on a phone I expect that it measures up in every way to the other phones on the market. Yes it has many features that are great and I really do like them, but the bells and whistles are not all that is important to me. I also was very upset to find that I cannot enlarge fonts, the apps avail are not the latest updates that other phones do have. I love amazon and I am very sad to have to return this phone, but I cant even check my bank account with a major bank because there isnt an app.
Great phone,wish it had some music equaliser,for bass,treble.....
Cloud is run on dirty energy, come on Amazon clean up your act.
my reason is because I got my first phone and it stopped working so I had to pay 99.00 for a new one through insurance and now with my second phone I just went to plug it in to charge and I was going to set my alarm and it froze so I tried to turn it off and now it wont turn back on and I don't want to have to pay another 99.00 for a new one
Do not like this cell phone at all, I bought it for the price! Big Mistake, Good advise, spend your money wisely, I tried to return it but it only had 14 days strict return policy and I had it for 15 days, You can not download any apps even the free ones unless you enter your debit card info and idk abt you guys but I do not like to give out my debit info or enter my info.like that on my cell or pc for security reasons, now days anybody who knows a lil bit about computers can high jack you. Time and date dose not display on your main screen, can't even download social media, so baisicly if you are like me that don't want to enter your debit info, all you have it's a regular fancy looking cell phone to text and call.
Needs more work
Pretty upset right now to be honest. I purchased an Amazon Phone on Aug.  2nd and was pretty excited, the phone arrived on Aug 5th. Set up was pretty quick and over the last few days I had enjoyed playing around with the phone. I like have Prime Music and Prime movies on my phone and some of the promised features were nice. Today on Aug. 14th I place my phone on a folding table. This table is maybe 3 feet tall. We have hard wood floors but we have several floor rugs through out the house. The table was hit and phone fell of hitting the floor. I have had a lot of phones and have dropped them. I dropped my wife's Iphone onto solid concrete and there was just a small scuff. My S3 has been dropped numerous times on the same floors. The phone has no visible damage other then a massive cracks though the screen I could not believe it. To be honest I have I could throw my S3 on to this rug and it would still be fine. So 9 days after buying the phone the only way to replace it is pay $200 deductible from ATT.  I told myself I was done with ATT but got sucked back in because the Fire was exclusive. Whatever you do if you own a Fire be very careful with the screen, they are made of crap and break very easy, just should not be this much damage from such a small fall. ATT is even worse, they have horrible customer service and there insurance is a waste of money and time. I am going to try and find someone to buy my contract and never deal with ATT again.
Came from Verizon Wireless and a HTC Incredible 3G.<br/>Had a problem getting old number ported and spent 45 minutes on the phone with AT&T.;  AT&T; support was great, forced the port and everything worked.  The underlying problem with the port was the AT&T; network is bouncing where I live.  It's up for a minute and down for about 4 minutes.  It's killing the battery to be constantly searching for signal.<br/>When AT&T; gets their network to stay up, I will post more about the phone itself.<br/>If AT&T; doesn't get their network problem fixed soon, this phone may go back.  It's not a problem with the FirePhone at all.<br/>More to follow.....<br/><br/>07/29/2014 Update:<br/>Turns out AT&T;'s network is fine.  Parked an Iphone on AT&T; right next to it, watched my phone drop and start searching for signal.  The Iphone was still showing 4G service.  Called At&T; who tyold me to contact Amazon since I purchased through them.  After 3 attempts at Amazon, I was connected to Heather who was very knowledgeable.<br/>Long story short, we think my phone has an antennae problem and they've shipped out a new phone.  If the new phone does the same thing, I guess I'll give up and get a Galaxy or (gulp) and Iphone.
The apps I used to use aren't available on the Fire.  Firefly doesn't recognize anything.  The music I like is available on Prime Music, but I have to pay for it.  The best thing about it is the free year of Prime.  Totally bummed.  I was so excited to get it and now, not so much.
The concept is great. Use of phone is wonderful.However, there are a few apps I use daily for work that I can only get from Google or itunes. Amazon should put it right out in the description that anything from these stores will not be accessible with this phone. Very disappointed. If Amazon can give me a solution I would gladly give this a much better rating
love my phone! <3
Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. I am upset that one of the Fire’s key features, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, comes with a hidden and harmful cost. Unlike Apple and Google who have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s data centers are powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary.
The is a nice phone but if Amazon really wants to make money from then it should have it for all phone company's my little brother has and loves it im with t-mobile i love my LG G flex but i would get this phone in a heart beat if it was for t-mobile
Bad company policy on energy!
Still learning

Buggy!!! No apps can't use my bank app or OneBusAway in Seattle the hometown of Amazon.  If the phone gets to full it wipes your storage clean.  Multiple times I try to make phone call the microphone won't turn on.  The hand gestures to access the side menus doesn't work half of the time.  The auto scrolling is horrible you end up fighting with the phone more then anything.  Half the time you select a menu option the wrong app is launched.  The music app is not user friendly to find out what song is playing you have to go into music app two menus deep.  Over priced and now it being sold for .99!?!?!?!  And I paid 199.99 and bought two phones we fell ripped off and we can't return these worthless buggy phones.<br/><br/>Wow I have never had such buyers remorse the more they update this piece carp.  The worse it performs constantly freezing and dropping audio.  I think Amazon has sold me that I will never buy another piece of hardware from them.  They obviously don't test the hardware or use the devices they produce.
this phone has a few negative aspects that makes it worthless.<br/><br/>For me, the first thing is the size.<br/><br/>I never bought any iPhone, because it was too small.<br/><br/>So this is the same reason I can not buy this fire phone.<br/><br/>With such a small display I always<br/><br/>press 2 buttons with one finger.<br/><br/>My hands are very big, so I need at least a 5,5" Display for<br/><br/>a proper touchscreen use.<br/><br/>The second problem is the sim-lock. Nobody likes sim-lock !<br/><br/>The third problem is the blocking of apps from outside of<br/><br/>amazon. Amazon should be more open.<br/><br/>Fans of amazon would still buy from amazon,<br/><br/>Even if they can get it somewhere else for less.<br/><br/>Amazon should trust their customer more.<br/><br/>So ..<br/><br/> I was really looking forward for this great phone.<br/><br/>But now I'm really disappointed.<br/><br/>I really hope that amazon will not give up fire phone.<br/><br/>They should just make it better with fire phone 2.<br/><br/>Bigger display and more open.<br/><br/>Then I would buy it immediatelly.
The Fire could be MUCH better.I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.
Some issues that I have came across since purchasing this phone.  1. IPhone users are not able to text to this phone, unless they turn off there Imessaging first. 2. The keypad will go blank. 3. It has a hard time staying connecting to my WiFi( did not have issues with my iPhone) 4. you are not able to transfer over your ring tone from iphone. 5. Battery seems to die faster. 6. No built in call blocking for those unwanted annoying people that call you. 7. Deleting calls one by one, instead of a clear all....these are just a few

Nice phone. I like the apps, the speakers sound great, pics look awesome. But the automatic service switch bites ass. I've had this phone for 2 days now and still waiting. Mayday punk booted me off my own router when he realized he couldn't fix my problem.

Why the Fire is really a misfire. I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.
Didn't Light My Fire ... I think it’s completely unnecessary that many of the Fire's key features, like unlimited cloud photo storage, are supported by Amazon's data centers that are powered by coal and other dirty energy. If Amazon matched competitors like Apple by powering their operations with clean and renewable energy, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.

It’s time to put out the Fire! It makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud is not a strong selling point, especially when competitors like Apple are using 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon can commit to using modern energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.
Seems ok.
the advertisements on tv about  this product are false. AT & T sent a hugh bill for nothing. We cancelled the service after two days of disappointment and being treated like dummies. Trial period ...what is that...just hype to snag new victims. Got the service for the movies...but surprise!  limited data but no limited bill...you've been warned...
Do Not emphasis Do Not buy this phone . You cannot pay people to take these phones they are so bad .  Usell offers you $24 they areso bad . On eBay they just sit there no one buys them they are so bad . Just don't do it .
It is a good phone but......it has limitations....doesnt have any apps to be able to download free music....also use can't get outside apps from like say play store from Google.

ordered this phone before was even available. was anxiously waiting for it to ship and arrive. was then very disappointed within 24 hours. no google play store available. couldn't link it to my gmail to auto backup my pics, or anything else I wanted it for. couldn't add more screens or apps. could be a nice phone with a lot more work. takes great pics is about all I can say for it. oh and the firefly is a great option. very over priced for what you get. returned it within 2 days!!
Granted I am no iphone pro- being in the latter end of my years I had hope with the Amazon name attached it would be the best- Not the case AND Not cool Amazon dropping the price $199.01 after I got it!
I absolutely HATE this phone!!!  It is by far the worst phone I have ever had.  Everything is an issue.  Why do I have to enter a credit card to get a free app?  That does not makes sense IT IS FREE!!!!  I was so Happy with my S4!  It was effortless.  I will NEVER stray from Samsung again!!!!!!

It's,ok
As much as I'd normally support anyone who fights Google's constant encroachment on Android's formerly open-source components with a viable fork of the AOSP codebase, the simple fact is that I don't have any use for a phone which is locked to American Telephone & Telegraph.<br/><br/>Even if it were unlocked, though, $649 is a bit steep for a phone with an oddball proprietary OS that's only dubiously compatible with the Android software base, and whose unique features are all gimmicks.
This phone is horrible is supposed to be like the IPhone but I give it 2 thumbs down you can't change anything on the screen its just basic .... I will be going back to a galaxy
I wanted to like this phone very much, but I'm not happy with the fact that Amazon's cloud data centers are still running on dirty energy - coal, gas and nuclear power.  Until Amazon can meet the competition by using clean energy for power, I'm not a customer.  There's no good reason why Amazon can't commit to using clean energy.  The competition does!  Time to move into the 21st century, Amazon!
I actually would have preferred to get FIRE than any other phone because of its great storage capacity, but considering Amazon does not use renewable energy to power its cloud, I decided for another brand... SORRY !
A company as big as Amazon has no business adding to the destruction of the planet by using dirty fossil fuels. They should be fined multiple millions of dollars for doing so. If they don't change to renewable energy, I will purchase my products elsewhere. They are greedy and only care about profits, to hell with the future of the planet seems to be their thinking. That is very sad to hear.

This phone does not have a back button. For instance  when you open up facebook pictures.  You have no way of going back to the previous page.

The phone freezes a lot. You can't download a lot of apps that other phones have. You can set up the home page like you want to.

Thanks
I am pis**ed beyond all possible expression. I love my phone yea it sucks that half my old apps arent compatible but hey i looked past that and figured theyll eventually make the transition. BUT to hear that LESS THAN TWO MONTHS AFTER I BOUGHT MY PHONE AT FULL PRICE that its going down to 99cents is a slap in the face. I want my money back. contract or no contract im seriously considering returning this to att just because of amazon clear disregard for it loyal customers. I feel bamboozled and ive gotta say that if you dont fix this somehow Amazon well then youre losing at least one customer. And im pretty sure I wont be the last.
Wouldn't even give a full star if that was an option. I didn't like it but some people might. It's just not for me.
Amazon's cloud is fueled by nonrenewable resources like coal and gas. Apple's iCloud uses renewable energy to power itself.  If Amazon can commit to using modern energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.
Amazon’s Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary. Storing our photos, music and messages shouldn’t mean we are forced to damage the health of our climate and communities. Apple, Facebook, and Google have figured out how to store our photos and music with renewable energy, and so can Amazon.
Maybe if Fire's cloud didn't use dirty, nonrenewable energy and instead tried using renewable resources like the iCloud, it would receive better reviews. We are in a climate crisis. It is time to take responsibility for our actions.

Amazon's unlimited cloud storage is powered by dirty energy (coal, gas, and nuclear power), unlike Apple's iCloud which is powered by 100% renewable energy. Amazon should take a cue from Apple and make the switch.
1 star
Complicated than i phone. battery life is the another problem. It remain only for 10-12 hours even if I did not use it.
Sent it back, not enough Applications available for me to be able to use it. 3-D is cool though...
I think it would be so much better if you had several different phone services to offer there would be more request for it. I love amazon.
first off let me say I am not an Apple fan boy. I have no particular affinity for either the iPhone or the Samsung.phone.<br/><br/>The amazon fire is a terrible phone. It locks up all the time, randomly dials people for no reason, and worst of all there are no apps. Like, none. And headphones that do exist are worthless.<br/><br/>So in summary: bad hardware, bad apps, bad phone.
Worst phone on the market. Doesn't save videos, fire fly works about half the time. I have had iPhone, galaxy, LG, and HTC phones and they are all head and shoulders above this phone. Would never recommended this phone to anyone.
Went to ATT to check out the phone. Phone has a great built but interface really sucks. Lack google playstore. There are so many other better alternative at this price range. Not recommended.
it's ok...am an old guy...this is my first smartphone...for me it's been alot of trial and error
The only issue I have with the fire phone is that the buttons don't always work. - Doug Borden
The phone meets my basic needs.  The picture quality is excellent.  Just take some time to figure out how to use and set up.  It is much better than the other fruit I had.
Sorry....Love Amazon but such a poor choice to go with AT&T; exclusively.  I will not use AT&T.;  Fool me once....<br/><br/>Phone could make me walk on water but I'm not giving my money to AT&T; due to poor customer service with a final strike 3 on my third attempt to use them.
Snazzy features, but couldn't be used in Europe.  Wouldn't connect to a roaming network
I haven't figured it out yet and the instructions are a little lacking but I'll write again once I do.
Great
Hey Jeff - sell the 64GB version for $99 (unlocked, no contract). Maybe it will sell. Maybe not. You crippled the phone based on your hatred for Google. You will end up in the dumpster - with MSFT.  Good luck!<br/><br/>Rob
I have pre-booked this phone since the day they launched it. I received it yesterday and I will return it tomorrow.<br/>Although I have bought the version without a service contract (assuming that this should be the UNLOCKED model), apparently this is not the case. After using Mayday (which is wonderful by the way) they confirmed today that  AT&T; exclusivity will forbid you to use Firephone on a different mobile network or without a track records that the user is an AT&T; customer (currently or previously).<br/><br/>Too bad...
Unfortunately this phone just isnt good enough to displace either IOS or Android.
Good
I have had this phone 4 days. 1. Screen is cracked already!!! Haven't dropped or put in back pocket... 2. Silk is really bad for internet browser. 3. Battery is better on my 4 year old phone that I just up graded from. Definitely going back!!!
I buy just about everything from amazon. But there electronic devices come with too much preloaded ads and spam. If you wanted to buy advertising I would recommend amazon products.
These phones are too big, they are 5.5" x 2.6" x 0.35" (139.2mm x 66.5mm x 8.9mm).  Yeah, lots of people want an unmanageable, tablet-sized phone or a phone that they have to carry in a holster or a suitcase, but there are still millions of people who want a reasonably-sized, manageable phone that will fit in their pocket.  Anything more that about 4.7" is just too big.  If I want to use a tablet, I'll use a tablet.  If I want to use a laptop, I'll use a laptop.  If I want to use a phone, then that is becoming a difficult thing to find.  The specs don't matter, nothing matters if it won't fit in a pocket where I can carry it where I'm going without CARRYING it all the time.  Some people are active in ways other than just talking and texting every waking moment. Some of us have moments of our lives that don't involve a phone.  Some of us actually interact with people face to face.  And we use a phone too.  I see people shopping for phones all the time who can't find one a reasonable size just as often as I see someone who wants a tablet-sized phone.  But none of the companies are making a normal sized cell phone anymore.  And by fitting in my pocket, I mean front pocket.  I'm not going to be sitting on my phone and then complaining about it warping or breaking like so many of you have done.  Also, I work for a living. I'm not able to spend every second managing the location of my phone (holding it, carrying it, moving it, not "sitting" because it is in a back pocket, or just constantly babysitting it).  So, if no one wants to make a normal sized cell phone, then I won't carry one.
Fire phone blocks Google Play Services!!!! No Google map, Runkeeper, Google anything basically....If I had known this I may have never bought this phone!!!!!<br/><br/>I truly like the phone, but this is crazy and a deal breaker for Google fans!
I returned this phone. it seems like at&t; want to be the only provider for this phone. amazon should have phones that are sold without a provider unlocked!!!
I have had a  kindle in the past and have been very impressed. So like a few other people who have reviewed this phone I thought I would give it a go!<br/><br/>MASSIVE mistake! Here's why!<br/><br/>1) It is essentially not a mobile as it cant hold enough charge to be mobile. - I feel this is a slight issue as it is sold as a mobile.<br/>2) It gets so hot you can cook and egg on it. - This could come in handy in a survival situation, however I doubt the battery would last long enough.<br/>3) It frequently cuts out mid call even with full reception - Again a think being able to function as a phone is quite critical if your making a phone.<br/>4) It crashes and freezes with clockwork regularity<br/>5) It frequently will phone one of my contacts at random, then freeze so that I cant hang up. Quite annoying in my book.<br/>6) It frequently cant connect to my wireless even when its right next to the router, all my other wireless appliances can without any issues<br/>7) The keypad freezes and closes fairly regularly, so you cant really use it reliably for texting/emailing or searching the internet.<br/><br/>There are however some thing's that its been very good for.<br/><br/>1) Wedging open doors and windows.<br/>2) Lifting floorboards<br/>3) The torch works - although only long enough to find a real torch as the battery runs out.<br/>4) Coaster<br/>5) Scraping ice of the car windscreen<br/>6) Contacting people - although this can only be achieved by throwing it directly at them as the battery is usually flat.<br/><br/>So to re-cap if you want a reliable method for contacting people get literally any other mobile phone. If you are doing some DIY and need to lift the floors or hammer in nails get an amazon fire phone. Having said that a hammer and crowbar don't come with 12 month contracts and a £200 price tag. Can I suggest product testing before general release next time?<br/><br/>As soon as I can, I will be trading it in for a note wrapped around a brick. Far more reliable than this piece of junk.
What an expensive piece of underwhelming crap. Maybe for $50, not these prices. For the same money you can get a g3 or Galaxy s5 which are better in every possible way and have full android market.
Everything connected with it is a problem.  Where is the operating manual?
Don't buy this phone.  Poor sound from beginning.  Limited function on several apps that worked on my old iPhone.  Screen goes blank during phone calls and have to turn off phone to recover.
I purchased mine after looking it over in the store. The price was only .99 with a 2 year contract which would accuracy bring the monthly total down quite a bit. I thought for that price if I didn't like it I would get another phone. Where do I start.<br/>1. Apps open by themselves<br/>2. Battery life not very long lived<br/>3. Pop up ads are constant.<br/>4. I felt as if I was being tracked.<br/>5. In your open apps there is always a list of suggested purchases.<br/>  It's like your a test market.<br/>Then the phone went crazy, my screen was locked and would not respond. It started relaying voice commands as if it had been reset to another mode.<br/>The day I took it back to the store the flip function as well as the tilt stopped working.<br/><br/>The very worst past was when I received my invoice my customer service rep. had charged me for the list price of the phone, $449.99 not the .99 I was to pay.  When I saw this in the paperwork at the store he told me not to pay any attention to it, I would only be charged a one time fee of the .99. Not true.  It took 2 phone calls, the second of which was 43 minutes for ATT to resolve the issue and take the phone back. Only after saying I was going to post my story on all forms of social media was my money refunded, my phone allowed to be returned (they were not going to take it back) and my contract canceled.  I told him over and over it was not the money it was the principal. I then purchased a Note4 and am very happy with it.<br/><br/>Take my advice, Do not purchase this phone. You will regret it.
I purchased this only because I got a deal on it for just over $100 and it included a 1 year extra on Prime so the phone was basically free.<br/><br/>This is one of the worst products I've ever used, ever.<br/><br/>I generally give my old phones to my kids (2 and 4 years old). They figure out stock Android or any of the custom roms very easily. They can navigate them easily, and install apps just fine from the Play Store.<br/><br/>This phone on the other hand has one of the worst UXs I've ever seen. It's completely unintuitive. I actually felt bad giving this to my 2 year old. It barely runs half the games they like to play. The Youtube app isn't even an app, it's a link to Youtube.com. All of the Amazon apps on it are just terrible imitations of their Google counterparts. I really can't in my right mind understand why Amazon thought anyone would actually like using this.<br/><br/>And to think some people actually paid $650 for this? Free was too high of a price. I hope Amazon takes a small hint from 1990s Sony and learns that custom formats rarely ever work. Even Amazon's new Underground app doesn't even work on the Fire Phone!<br/><br/>Now the phone just sits in my glove box in my car now as an emergency phone in case I ever forget mine. I have a feeling I'll just leave it there for the next owner of my car.<br/><br/>I'm a huge Amazon supporter, shareholder, and customer and I am embarrassed that this was ever released.
Unlike Apple’s iCloud which is powered by 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power.
Very disappointing. No access allowed to Google, thus NO apps. Replacement apps are nil or inadequate.
could not get it work, att didn't know, amazon no help would have liked to have used it.
I'm getting fussy on Amazon's fart phone...smart maybe can't tell..leaves me wonder if I can't make it work for me now or let me think I can some day soon...I did more on my old phone...I can't even get on amazon.com and it's their product...haven't made a purchase from anyone on it yet...what the flip! Can't shut out the proof reader..sends out mssg I didn't mean to....don't put words into my mouth ..that's what I said and mean! Why can't I get on the web...this is mobile rtf? I'm no idiot but..this isn't  working for me...had it 3months. Never got a bill the same once....gets bigger every month...138.00 it's only gonna cost 60...Bullish.. I had everything I needed before why did I think this was going to be better...huh.3 more years of this shi...t not even. I have fire tv an kindle he love them...what flip with the fire phone..what a waste..not at all the product Amazon puts out...very disappointed...I use my q link (Obama phone) more....it's free ..!Amazon AT&Tmade; a sucker outta me!  Don't buy this till they pull it together....it's cute no use at all...spending more time charging it than using it...oops dropped it....should I pick it up? Hummmm
Environmental effects from the production of this phone are completely unacceptable!
I haven't learned all of the new features yet.
Great phone but would like more options for personalizing
Want to go to another phone company can it be used
Being tied to AT&T; wipes away all the cost savings Amazon is trying to tout.  Must be a huge kick back from AT&T; to Amazon for each phone which eliminates the cost attractiveness to the customer.  Forget it.
this phone shouldn't only be limited to service contract? I would love to have it has a pre-paid boostmobile phone.
I was excited for this phone and bought it due to the fact I could not find a decent review. Most of the reviews on here are only to slander at&t.; I work for at&t; and have had the service for a few years and the service is just as favorable as any other cell service in my area. The problem with this phone isn't the service it's everything else. I was lead to believe it was just "watered down" android but it isn't. It's its own OS which is fine but it's a poorly executed OS. For starters I get no noise notification when I receive a new reply on twitter, comment on fb, or like on IG. It is a pain to get the status bar to drag down. Apps are slow and genuinely unresponsive. Amazon Prime Music is a joke. Literally any music I wanted to listen to I would still have to pay for. The lack of a real YouTube app is very disappointing. The only perk to this phone is a free year of prime. But, even for that, I won't be keeping it.
on price change, Amazon agreed to pay the refund of 200$. That's great.
I love it and it has the real instagram.
This is so much better than iPhones!
As a phone it's relatively ok. It has a decent camera. The dynamic perspective is kinda kewl. That's about the end of the positives.<br/><br/>The Amazon app store is pathetic. They seriously need to work some kind of deal with Google. Supposedly the lack of apps can be overcome with apks, but I've never managed to get any of them to function. This device can not keep a WiFi connection, which forces me to waste 4G data. The battery barely lasts through a day of sitting and doing nothing while I'm at work. It's less than two hours of actual use. I prefer Survivor cases for my phones. Of course there's not one available for this phone.<br/><br/>I'm counting the days until I can trade it in.
I've had the phone less than a week and wow meaning good and bad. Good tilt roll, side panels, size, easy to use. Until the manual app stop working. Mayday is sick and tried of me calling them. Hold the phone a certain way and it gets pretty hot. That will come in handy for the winter. Nice hand warmer! The biggest issue is the APPS. Att is selling the phone then why don't they have any att apps? Transfer and bill paying. Big deal.  I need the On Star app. BMO Harris Bank? Just to name a few. The girl on Mayday said she has the On Star app. So customer service uses a different phone not the Amazon Fire phone sweet. I will start taking my GM car to Ford because GM stopped using GM parts.
can you use this as a prepaid phone
Shame on you Amazon. For a company as large as you are, you have a responsibility to set a precedent of global responsibility toward protecting the environment for future generations. Switch to clean energy.
I would love to have this phone if it were not locked to specific carriers. (which I have no doubt it was a support contract). I would like to submit a few recomendations on the next Fire Phone upgrade. If you would like to sell a lot more of your phones you should be the first phone maker to incorporate end to end phone call and text messaging encryption and well as email and NOT release encryption information to nosey GOV (By Law you have to unless you do not store it) (could open you up to big Gov Contracts). My next recomendation would be to make the phone work for any carrier and never allow it to be locked.<br/>Like I said, you need someone in charge of the phone line that knows what the people want or need on the security side of things. I will stick to my iPhone for now until I find a phone that provides the security that is needed in todays world of hacking and spying.
I can not use this phone with T-Mobile
One of the worst purchases I've ever made.  I bought it hoping that even if the software was awful, the xda forums would show me a way to put a different version of Android on it.  This never happened.<br/><br/>The interface, while it has a few nice touches, pales in comparison to the polish I'd come to expect from more standard implementations of Android.  The loss of Google services is also a major blow to the usability of this phone.<br/><br/>I got a few apps installed through a third party market, but several of them did not work right.<br/><br/>I tried to return it three days after the last day I could get a refund and ended up dropping several hundred dollars on an HTC and eating the loss just so I could stop using this thing.  Now amazon has lowered the price to $0.99 so I probably can't even sell it now.<br/><br/>The only thing they did get right was the headphones.  They're like magic the way they don't get tangled and they have the most comfortable ear buds I've used.
Little glitches....apps need more
Dirty energy! Terrible! Shameful! Cheapskates!
mistake buying this!!!! my iphone is better
The Fire could be MUCH better.I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.  My County has been bought by the rich and corporations and they have misused their power to profit off the backs of the ordinary tax payer (who pays more than any of the rich or corporations do, MUST change the tax code!), and now it becomes clear that they are profiting off the environment too!  Shameful...shameful!
Amazon should highly consider selling the Amazon Fire Phone at a much reduced rate and specifically, an unlocked version of your Fire Phone. Premiering your new phone locked to AT&T; as a service provider, as Apple did, was, IMHO one of your biggest mistakes! Now you are probably contractually locked in to AT&T; for the next 5 years (like Apple) which will do nothing for ramping up the sales of an over priced device that at best should have been an unlocked device with a better price point. Especially in this day & time with most people hunting & pecking to save in every way they can. If consumer purchasing habits are indicators of things to come, then Amazon, take heed! Contractually obligated phones will soon go the way of the DoDo Birds but unlike that majestic creature will NOT be missed!
Great phone! More than I expected
Update: My Fire Phone has started to malfunction. The home button is not working correctly when the phone is locked. Instead of opening to the screensaver, it shows the screen and then closes like a camera shutter. This happens approximately five times before the screensaver pops up. It was happening every few times I tried to unlock the phone, but now it's happening nearly every time. I contacted AT&T; customer support about filing a warranty claim. The rep there walked me through a number of steps and eventually urged me to reset my phone to factory settings. I was reluctant to do so, but I was advised that all of my info had been backed up to the cloud and I would be fine. I don't typically trust AT&T;, so I looked to Amazon itself to back up this info. At this link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201556270 I found info which seemed to line up with what the AT&T; rep was telling me about my info, specifically my text messages, being backed up to the cloud. So, I went through with the factory restore. Long story short, I lost my text messages. They were not backed up. AT&T; suggested that I contact Amazon, which I was happy to do. I do trust Amazon. Unfortunately, now I'm being told that my text messages are lost. That "the software version that is out for the fire phone does not restore text messages". Amazon, in my opinion, is contradicting itself on this issue. I'm very, very dissatisfied. Also, my phone (which never worked that great to begin with) is still malfunctioning.<br/><br/>Update: Amazon customer service did contact me and offer me a refund for the price difference. The superior customer service is why I love Amazon so much in the first place. Hopefully, updates will be made available to fix some of the issues I'm dealing with in regards to the phone.<br/><br/>I absolutely hate my Fire phone. I love Amazon, and rushed to buy this phone. Obviously, I should have waited for more reviews to come in. I have issues with almost every feature, but my biggest issue is that the bluetooth connectivity sucks. SUCKS. There is no ringtone market. I have to restart up to five times a day in order for the phone to work correctly. The phone searches for service in nearly every area of my house, my iPhone never did. Even the Audible app, which is owned by Amazon, does not work correctly. Also, why did I pay $649.00 for you to drop the price of the phone by $200 so soon after release. As much as I dislike Apple's proprietary nature, I fear I will never again stray from an iPhone or similar Apple product.
The Fire Phone is powered by dirty coal.
Can I FaceTime on this phone
WE NEED CLEAN ENEERGY!!!
Good  phone- totally painful App Store experience.
I really enjoyed this iphone.
Amazon the fire went out!!!
So Amazon has gone and did it, they made a really nice smartphone, while there are some great things built into it and is exclusive to amazon prime like its tablets, one of the biggest things that deserve to make it a one star is the fact that they chose to only go with one network, AT&T;, it may be the second largest wireless but that doesn't mean it's the best, if they want to make there product a success, then they need to take a page out what the other networks learned, one cell phone multiple networks for people to choose from, I know as a tech geek I would of like to of had one, but why would I want to spend a ton of money to another carrier when I am already paying so much for the network I already have.
Very unhappy with product
I wanted to love this phone and if I had not missed the return deadline I would have taken it back. The main reason I don't like is that the phone does not support the most basic apps, such a my bank and Delta airline...I live in the south and for that reason alone I hate this phone. I am going back to the I Phone as soon as I can! Especially now that they have the bigger screen! I would love to keep but I cannot get an answer as to why these basic apps will not work on the Fire. BTW I called delta and Suntrust and they stated it is not them it is Amazon! Bad customer service attached to phone also.
This is my review:<br/><br/>Its a flop. Nothing special or exciting in this. Dynamic perspective is a wallpaper u use on homescreen. But we cant keep on staring at homescreen all the time. so its just a one screen.<br/><br/>Apps: Failed to support bank of America, Citi bank , Vonage apps, my regular and frequent apps. This has disappointed me a lot.<br/><br/>camera: compared to iphone and fire, Fire grabs attention. When fire to HTc/Samsung/LG: failed to withstand .<br/><br/>Battery: I dont have comments for charging yet, coz i need a day or more to check . But when phone is in charge, back panel is too warm/hot.<br/><br/>When it failed to support apps frequently used by customers, I'd say it cant be a hit or atleast a normal phone.
Not that good actually.
Buyers beware. ATT was not helpful when trying to purchase this phone. Did not contact us to let us know there was a problem with purchase. Two of these phones were purchased, along with $300 fee for new activation, driving the cost to over $700. Then get the first Bill, and hello hidden charges!! And knowing that my guy and I are stuck with these phones for two years! Truly disappointing, Amazon and ATT. Anytime there is a problem we are told to go to the other for help. Not reassuring that we made good purchases at all!!
Amazon's Fire Phone cloud data storage, in contrast to Apple's iCloud (run to 100% on renewable energy), is run on unsustainable polluting energy such as coal, gas and nuclear power.<br/><br/>Didn't Light My Fire ... I think it’s completely unnecessary that many of the Fire's key features, like unlimited cloud photo storage, are supported by Amazon's data centers that are powered by coal and other dirty energy. If Amazon matched competitors like Apple by powering their operations with clean and renewable energy, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.
Amazingly bad phone. I am a huge amazon fan but completely hate this phone that has given my husband so many issues. To add insult to injury, if you bought it through ATT, nothing you can do to return or exchange it. I will likely never buy an amazon device (kindle etc) again but would continue to shop at Amazon.com<br/><br/>On my way to cancel the ATT contract - worst customer service in the world (right after comcast and time warner)
I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to use clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.
It’s time to put out the Fire! It makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud is not a strong selling point, especially when competitors like Apple are using 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon can commit to using modern energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.
I hate this phone. I liked it initially. Then I hated it.<br/><br/>It's well polished, like most things Amazon. First impression: slick hardware, nice interface.<br/><br/>But as time passed, like 24 hours, I started to freak. This is the smart phone for idiots. Just a few examples: they removed the back button and almost every settings section. Because, you know, being in the driver's seat may lead to feelings of inadequacy and paranoia.<br/><br/>If you want polish, get an iPhone. If you want innovation, get a real Android. If you want to consume Amazon content, get a Fire tablet. This is a pointless device.
The last straw. I just wrote a thorough review of why I think think the Amazon fire phone is a fail, just to have the phone freeze up. I had to restart losing most of my review. I was in fear of this happening so approximately one-third of the way through I copied my review so this is what I have left of my review.<br/>Amazon Fire Phone, 64GB...<br/>Amazon<br/>Rating posted.<br/>Write a review<br/><br/>Amazon Fire Phone, 64GB...<br/>Amazon<br/>Rating posted.<br/>Write a review<br/>Yep just as I suspected nothing!

I went and looked at this phone in the AT&T; store. The interface is very archaic and confusing. The whole premise of the phone (this gimmick of dynamic perspective) just doesn't do it for me. I tried to like this phone but ended up going with an iPhone 6 Plus.<br/><br/>I really hope Amazon makes another attempt at a smartphone, but next time it should actually bring something new to the table. If they released a phone with week long battery life or a really great camera they'd have a better chance of making an impact in such a saturated market.
I love amazon, but seriously its the dumbest smartphone out there, it needs to have google play store. The amazon apps store has next to none third party apps, you cant download anything on it, only like bs apps you have to pay for or pay to use, i am trying to figure out how i can return it. Don't get it, the phone has high specs which is what sold me at first, but after receiving the phone i am highly disappointed!

I'm definitely not a fan of this phone... can't delete contacts all at once, phone switches off speaker phone by itself, no notifications on certain things, I'm going back to iPhone... the one good thing about it was that the company has given me my money back on the phone as a Amazon gift card on my account, and  the 1yr Amazon prime membership is great but the phone has a lot of glitches that needs to be improved for sure...

Amazon’s Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary. Storing our photos, music and messages shouldn’t mean we are forced to damage the health of our climate and communities. Apple, Facebook, and Google have figured out how to store our photos and music with renewable energy, and so can Amazon. These reviews will show Amazon that it’s time to move to modern energy sources and make a “smarter phone” supported by clean, renewable energy.
Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. I am upset that one of the Fire’s key features, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, comes with a hidden and harmful cost. Unlike Apple and Google who have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s data centers are powered by DIRTY ENERGY like coal and gas. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY!

Not Energy efficient...
i cant find the ask questions section so i would ask this. If you get this without the contract the fcc said you can switch after the contract has been fulfilled. I believe at&t; signed onto this voluntary agreement. Here is a copy of this agreement https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-324664A2.pdf how hard is this to do has someone tried yet??

I read that your cloud storage uses coal and fossil fuels instead of renewables. It is infuriating that your low prices are made possible by polluting our world. And all to make money. You are alienating me. Low prices are not worth my polluting the atmosphere and damaging the life of my grandchildren.  Martha Cray<br/><br/>SHAPE UP
Didn't Light My Fire ... I think it's completely unnecessary that many of the Fire's key features, like unlimited cloud photo storage, are supported by Amazon's data centers that are powered by coal and other dirty energy. If Amazon matched competitors like Apple by powering their operations with clean and renewable energy, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.
The Fire could be MUCH better. I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.
Why the Fire is really a misfire. I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.
Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. I am upset that one of the Fire’s key features, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, comes with a hidden and harmful cost. Unlike Apple and Google who have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s data centers are powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary.
It needs to be ported to other carriers. limiting it to AT&T; is just plain insane. Hopefully they come out in the next version. a version for each of the pay as you go carriers. AT&T; and Verizon offer unlimited plans but then turn around months later and throttle their unlimited costumers. With amazon content directly tied to the phone you will hit these limits.

Burn Coal!!!!!!!!!!
I love the phone
Amazon’s Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary. Storing our photos, music and messages shouldn’t mean we are forced to damage the health of our climate and communities. Apple, Facebook, and Google have figured out how to store our photos and music with renewable energy, and so can Amazon. 
Worst phone ever
Even if this was the best phone to come out for the next ten years Amazon should be ashamed of themselves by pricing it at 650 and then lowering the price only 6 months later to 199. I feel like Amazon has gouged me and therefore I will discontinue all uses of there service.  I for one will be taking my business elsewhere without a proper refund.
Looks like a nice phone that I would use, BUT no AT&T; native service here in Maine.  The best choice here in Maine is Verizon.  Also, this phone needs to include the Google ecosystem... I "live" on gmail and love google navigate and maps... I will order this when its available on Verizon and supports Google apps.
Horrible phone.
Probably my least favorite thing about this phone was switching all my data and apps. NONE of my favorite apps work on this phone except for Instagram. I'm definitely going to be switching this phone out. The battery drains too quickly as a result of its unnecessary cameras as well. Definitely doesn't light my fire.
The Phone is TOOOOOO expensive!!! One of my friends purchased the Fire Phone and although it does have some interesting features, it is not worth $600 hard earned dollars.  Not the best bang for your buck which is what I and other like myself are looking for these days.  Sorry Amazon....
I would have bought it just to play with it, but after reading all the reviews, positive and negative, I think I'll just go back to sleep and keep my iPhone 4S for another few iterations. Or, until I go to work for someonw who gives me a phone or their choosing. Hopefully, it won't be a Fire.
Unlike Apple and Google, which have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s data centers are powered by dirty energy (e.g., coal and gas). Don't consider the Fire phone and its unnecessary reliancee on dirty energy until Amazon cleans up its act.
I love my Fire phone - so easy to use.  I just dont like having to deal with at&t; - so far I have been in the store 3Xs and they cant give me any info on this phone - they keep telling me they dont have the softwear for it yet???  What a company.

Awesome phone
Dirty energy
This phone did not measure up to the Samsung Galaxy. I'm sorry but I needed so much more flexibility than it could offer. I sent a note along with the phone regarding the complications and upgrades that need to be added.
I was planning getting one of these, but then I discovered how the "unlimited data storage" was powered by dirty coal & not renewable power like Apple & Google.  Guess I will buy a Samsung instead.
Very disappointed in this phone.  I really wanted to like it but the longer I have it the more I regret it.  I wish I still had the opportunity to send it back because I would.
No comment
I'm happy!
Im not too happy. Many of my options were not set up & making use difficult. I wasn't assisted to arrange these options that I had on my old phone to be set on this new one. Thank you.
The energy that powers the production, distribution, and design of this phone is rapidly destroying any chance for humans or any other creatures to survive on this planet.
This phone is geared toward kids but uses way to much data and caused overage charges on my bill. Never had this problem with my iphone. I would not buy this phone again.
Nice device, but no info on how much energy it consumes in the cloud, or where that energy comes from. Hidden costs that we all have to pay whether we buy the product or not.
Not good.
Amazon's data centers are powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. The Fire's reliance on dirty energy isn't cutting edge, and it's completely unnecessary.
Unlike Apple’s iCloud which is powered by 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power.
I sent it back. I never opened it because once I read what AT&T; was going to charge I simply returned it.  Too bad.  They need to have another carrier option.
Worst phone, over heats, no youtube, no actual enjoyable apps, don't waste the time or money on this failure of a phone, I learned the hard way
Is missing Google play applications as the kindle and every Amazon device. Amazon and advice, make your phones full android compatible and you shall succeed.
No more languages​​, only English and Spanish, the built-in app too messy, you can not buy app, free is not OK, THE CEO is a sucker, do not lose strange!
The utter FILTH behind the production of this atrocity shows a basic contempt for the concept of maintaining life on planet Earth.
Didn't like this phone at all. Having a Galaxy prior to this, I was used to the larger size. This one is way too small for my taste. I sent it back.
Just no.
I am a die hard amazon customer and a prime member. I have so far purchased 3 kindle fire hd devices (one for myself and rest for other members of my family). After my non-pleasing experience in those amazon gadgets, I skipped the fire hdx generation of tablets and now it came to evaluating their flagship smartphone 'Fire phone'. First thing first, I have not myself purchased this phone yet and am not planning to purchase it in the near future until users gain more hands on experience on the device. However, I have spent quite sometime playing with one of my colleague's fire phone and moreover I visited the AT&T; branch to make another look to one of those devices. This hands on experience, combined with a detailed web search on specifications have helped me write this review which can only be an initial impression of this device.<br/><br/>Price range: This is the most shocking aspect of this smartphone for me. I was expecting that amazon would rather make a phone with less than $400 price tag ,something similar to nexus 5 of google perhaps. This was due to my general experience on amazon's price policy. Kindle generation tablets were sold at more affordable prices and aimed the customers who do not want to spend a fortune for a device that would be outdated in a year or so. Besides, Jeff Bezos repeatedly declared that amazon as a company values selling apps from their market place rather than selling devices.<br/><br/>With the exact wording, in the announcement of kindle fire hd devices in september 2012: 'We want to make money when people use our devices, not when they buy our devices'.<br/><br/>That claim had been a decision maker for me when buying my kindle tablets. But now, two years later, amazon enters the smartphone arena with one of the highest price tags in the field. I know they offer a free prime membership included in the price but that does not make a lot of sense for most of the smartphone customers. Only someone who routinely uses their subscribe and save program or orders 2-3 times a week from amazon or values watching some prime movies that could easily be found elsewhere for free would be attracted to this additional spice up deal. Other than that people would not find it as a game changer at all. Looking at the price tag, I can say that either amazon changed their policy about pricing their products, or they are extremely confident about the superiority of this device. Therefore I will have to compare this phone with iphone 5 or samsung galaxy s5 (the giants of the arena) and try to find an answer to the question that millions are asking now: 'Why would I pay $650 for an Amazon phone?)<br/><br/>Technical specs: Samsung galaxy S5 comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 Quad-Core with a clock speed of 2.5 ghz. It has 2 gb ram and the minimum storage of 16 gb which can be extended to 64 gb with external micro SD card slot. Iphone 5 comes with a dual core 1.3 ghz apple swift processor and 1gb ram. It does not come with an option of micro SD card to extend memory. Finally amazon fire phone comes with Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 Quad-Core with a clock speed of 2.2 ghz which is slightly inferior compared to samsung galaxy s5. In my limited experience on both devices, during routine tasks I saw no difference, as expected but they might be functioning slightly different while being challenged with demanding apps, which I did not have a chance to try. It comes with 2gb ram but unfortunately amazon fire phone can not accommodate an external storage card and you are locked in to the 32gb (cheaper model) storage capacity of the device. Amazon tries to sweeten this by offering free cloud storage to every app or book or whatever that is bought from their marketplace. Yet, this does not change the fact that you will need to use the physical storage for every photo you take, every movie you record and all other files you bring in. So in terms of technical specs: the winner is Samsung galaxy S5 while amazon looks like a good runner up.<br/><br/>Camera: Samsung Galaxy S5 comes with a 15mp rear and 2mp front facing camera while iphone 5 is 8mp and 1.2 mp respectively. On the other hand amazon fire phone is equipped with 13mp rear and 2.1 mp front facing camera. They all can do 1080p full HD video recording but only Samsung Galaxy S5 has an additional capability of ultra hd 4k recording which looks like a great advantage at first but rather a myth in practicality. I have read several reviews comparing the quality of fire phone imaged with DSLRs and they made me laugh a lot. I agree fire phone and all these other high tech devices can get crisp images even at challenging conditions like low light etc, but comparing a smart phone with a DSLR is not even funny. I own 3 DSLRs (one full frame Canon EOS 5d mark II and two 1.6 crop factor : EOS 7D and 500D) Anyone who is into the world of photography would know that sensor size matters way more than pixels. With a tiny sensor size like seen in smartphones, increasing pixel density would actually work opposite to the general belief so rather than increasing image quality they lose details and it is almost impossible to generate depth of field with a smartphone camera. These camera specs offer a handy solution to daily needs but you should never expect to get a DSLR quality image no matter what from any smartphone. So my verdict in this category is a tie between Samsung Galaxy and firephone yet some of you may declare samsung as the king of this hill too...<br/><br/>Call Quality: There is not much to say about this since all modern smartphones offer pretty decent connectivity and call quality. I have made a few calls through firephone and it is great like the others. However, I think it is not very vice to offer fire phone through AT-T only. I am sure many people would not want to change their company and that decision would put them off from buying this device. May be later amazon extends the range to other vendors at least to verizon, which would surely increase the number of potential buyers.<br/><br/>Sound quality: If I have to list only one thing I like about amazon devices that would be their booming sound quality. Although I found my kindles as bad investments and under-performers, I have always admired their sound. Fire phone is no different. It can offer a great listening experience. But the other devices are pretty decent too..<br/><br/>Dimensions and weight: Samsung galaxy s5 is 5.59 x 2.85 x .32 inches and weighs 5.1 ounces. Iphone 5 is 4.87 x 2.31 x 0.30 inches and weighs 3.95 ounces. Finally amazon fire phone is 5.5 x 2.6 x 0.35 inches and weighs 5.64 ounces. So it ranks as the heaviest and the thickest among all. It is slightly shorter than samsung galaxy but considering the significant display size difference, I believe it is longer than it should be too. So I can not say that amazon's design is a state of art one and some people who are after slimmer designs may find this phone a little bulky to carry in their pockets.<br/><br/>Display quality and screen: Amazon lags behind the samsung galaxy with its 4.7 inch diagonal screen size (5.1 inches for samsung) but is better than apples standard 4 inch iphone displays. In terms of the screen resolution (measured by pixel per inch of display) amazon's new contender does not match its rivals. Its 315 ppi resolution lags behind iphone 5's 326ppi and gets a crushing defeat under the 432 ppi of samsung galaxy s5. They all offer scratch resistant and sensitive touch screens so they are all the same in that aspect.<br/><br/>Battery: Amazon fire phone comes with a non removable battery with 2400 mAh capacity. Iphone has a much weaker battery (1300mAh and not removable as well). On the other hand samsung has 2800mAh removable battery. I have experienced samsung galaxies getting pretty hot to touch which was a personal minus for those devices from my side but other than that a removable battery always prevails over the non-removable one which kind of means battery dies=phone dies in my book.<br/><br/>Value of amazon experience: If you are a die hard amazon customer like myself with a lot to watch from prime video archive or have already purchased lots of apps from their marketplace another amazon device would be a good addition to your fleet. With the new firefly technology and live assistance (may day) options you feel stronger backing of amazon behind your purchase. Amazon's customer service is the king in the field too. Even if your device fails after the warranty, I strongly believe that amazon would not hesitate replacing the phone. I have seen no company with better customer service than them, which may be a good reason to buy their device compared to 'computer says no' type of approach in many other companies.<br/><br/>Browsing: Android devices including amazon and samsung, unfortunately lack flash support in their default browser (chrome and silk). Apple and microsoft phones are able to run flash videos and besides, the silk browser has the honor of being the worst browser I have ever used in any platform. Crashing almost every time even leading to a total freezing, in addition to slow browsing time was all I have seen from it in my kindle fire hd devices. Chrome is considerably smoother in browsing but still in both devices you would need a helping hand like dolphin browser which would overcome the flash issue and offer a rather smoother browsing experience.<br/><br/>Extras: I have to say that the eye tracking system and all the fancy scrolling with tilting stuff do not look that much of a game changer for me. On the other hand it can connect ot 802.11.ac 5hz network which means a lot more to me. All devices come with extra fancy features so I am not going to go in detail that much. However, just to give an example, I value the waterproof capability of samsung galaxy s5 over the eye tracking system of amazon.<br/><br/>My conclusion: After a limited hands on experience and the deep comparison of the specs, I do not think I have found enough reasoning to push me towards a firephone. It is a decent phone with up to date specs, but it is still a risk to pay that much to a brand with no mobile phone expertise in the past. According to a report from Forbes magazine only 11.8% of US population over 18 who are planing to buy a smartphone said they are considering firephone as an option while the percentages are 40.8% for samsung galaxy and 45% for iphone and more surprisingly even prime members do not seem to have accepted the hefty price tag with only 21.8% putting amazon firephone as a prospective smartphone for themselves. My kindle fires worked fine for a couple of months before they started declining in their performance and finally being a nightmare within less than a year. We had to replace one for twice due to underperformance as well as charging and heating issues. The other one has become a toy for my son while I moved to nexus 7. This experience also puts me on hold towards a new amazon device.<br/><br/>Based on my pleasant initial hands on experience, I could rate this device 5 stars if the price was within $400-450 range. But so far, in this price range, buying a samsung galaxy looks like a better value for money. I will keep an eye on the longer term performance of this device (from my colleague who owns it) and look for a price decrease which is likely, considering the other amazon devices. Then may be in a few months, I will reconsider my decision towards this device
Environmental impact of this device said to be horrendous. Amazon needs to be open with its customers about its environmental footprint.
Amazon needs to switch to clean energy before there is no planet to sell phones on!
Amazon 5-Stars; AT&T; 1-Star.<br/>Pair up with another service and it's a lock.
this is my first cell phone so I don*t have much to say but I noticed the battery needs to be charged  constantly even if unused.
Awesome
I have been trying to set up new phone but can't because phone asks me for a password and I made no password to open it what do I do
Misfire! I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud. 
This company and this new phone should be powered by clean energy so my 6 year old son has a chance at a decent climate future!!!
There are several important apps that I cannot download.  When I search for them, they don't even show up.
Really sorry you decided to use dirty energy to power this new Fire Phone. Disappointed in you.
battery life not that good. phone gets very hot in a short time. i liked my windows phone way better
Amazon’s cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power.
Amazon has the resources to store data using renewables but chooses not to.
it has a lot of problems, the calendar does not work on my network. plus more draw backs. a lot of bugs.
The energy source for this phone is not deemed to be environmentally friendly!
too big and too hard to figure out,plus a lot of the functions d'ont work as advertised
ABSOLUTELY NOT WORTH THE MONEY.........I WISH I'D GONE WITH APPLE!
Amazon doesn't use modern energy sources, therefore, it totally sucks.
Powered by your failing planet. Buy a phone from a company that backs renewable fuels.
Disappointed in phone. Wish it had goggle apps.i will b kind and leave it at 2 stars.
Cool!
Didn't Light My Fire ... It's unnecessary that many of the Fire's key features, like unlimited cloud photo storage, are supported by Amazon's data centers that are powered by coal and other dirty energy. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon.
I don,t get phone reception at my location from AT&T; is there some way to get it
As a long-time Amazon customer, I am disappointed to learn that many features of the Fire are powered by dirty energy.  I was among the 400,000 who marched in the streets of NYC to demand meaningful action to turn the tide of climate change. While our politicians twiddle their thumbs and rake in mountains of money from the fossil fuel industry, I would hope that forward thinking companies would take the lead in transitioning to clean, renewable energy. Apple has done this, and it doesn't seem to be hurting their bottom line. I am in the market for a phone, and have made my decision - I will buy an iphone.
I would buy it in a heart beat,,,if I could contract with Verizon.
It's run by dirty energy and for that reason I am not pleased with it.
Get rid of dirty energy.
Amazon fire is not what I expected it dose not meet my expectations.
There's a lot about this phone I don't like. Too many to list.
The biggest mistake you made was limiting your contract service to 1 provider.  You should have learned from Apple.  They would have probably had a bigger smartphone foot hold had they not done just that in the first place.  I so wanted to love this phone and as I ended up buying 2 smartphones this summer for my kids back to school this was looking to be my choice.  Then the announcement came that is was AT&T; only.  WTH?  Your a Washington based company and you didn't pick the other Washington based company (T-mobile) if you were going for a single provider.  I was not will to pay in full for 2 phone to use with my chosen carrier.  I would have loved to get this but in the end my kids picked a different smart phone.  :(
It’s time to put out the Fire! It makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud is not a strong selling point, especially when competitors like Apple are using 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon can commit to using modern energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.
I would like a new phone. I can't do anything on here. I want a new one
Price is way to high for having nothing on it.
I'll be sticking to my iPhone -- even though iCloud storage is limited, I can use it with a clear conscience as it is powered by 100% renewable energy! Amazon refuses to commit to sustainable solutions and runs its cloud data centers on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear. It's irresponsible and stupid to continue to rely on these fuels which are destroying our planet. If Amazon wants smartphone customers to take the Fire seriously, it needs to move to modern, renewable energy as its would-be competitors have done.
Unable to get a lot of apps that I needed for work and home.
Why couldn't you match your competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.  I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to clean engergy.
Do yourself a favor go buy a flip phone Circa 2000 before you buy this phone. You"ll get better apps that way. It's like getting an arm cut off losing google maps, google music and even the apps still available like my fitness pals for example, are versions we had three years ago. Why are they different heck if I know. Fine Amazon you want to use your apps then improve on the one's we've learned to rely on. Your maps app is stupid. Why would you take out the option for a different route or the ability to avoid highways. I"m now stuck checking it all out home and PRINTING it out like I did when I had a flip phone. You could correct this horrible travesty of a phone. So be smart and do it. As it is right now, I'm dumping this phone as soon as I can. DO NOT BUY. And Amazon I will never trust one of your products again.
it has a nice camera but I went back to my iphone 4s.
OVERPRICED, OVERSIZED, OVERATED...Returned right away
It is not the size I was told. It is smaller than I wanted
im waiting for the iphone 6 to become available.im currently w/ metro pcs with galaxy note 3 ,i bought overseas.when,i learned that the price for this phone dropped to .99 cents,i came here to read recent reviews.i would have taken the bait ,if it is not with att.i dumped them @ yrs ago ,after being with them for nearly a decade.im not going back to att .they're very deceitful and will never go back to them again ,come hell or high water.pls amazon,set this phone free.let verizon establish business w/ you.i should have signed up now ,if only not for att.
Unable to use the phone as i purchased without service plan, it still comes with AT&T; lock. Called Amazon to unlock it, they want me to call AT&T.; Called AT&T; they want me to call amazon as they don't know how to unlock a phone without their phone number. Called amazon back they don't know what to do...Can someone at amazon figure out and let me know the process to unlock the phone.<br/><br/>Update :I researched online and found other customers facing same issue. I am big fan of amazon but just shocked that they are still selling without service plan option - why? it is not an option just take that option out please..<br/><br/>Once i receive an update i will re-review the phone
The Fire could be MUCH better.I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.

Because it can only use energy generated by coal fired plants I have to rate this as one star only. Had it been usable with renewable energy sources, it would have been rated for higher. A real shame for Amazon.
As usual..ATT are a problem.It says my zip is non existent.I once had an iPhone that didn't work for a year and they would not let me out of my contract or refund my $1200 for the year.When the contract expired they said they would have let m e out..but no refund..DONT buy anything cellular from ATT service.
Just no this product is very hard to use

The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary.

I would have most likely picked this up if it was available for Sprint but AT&T; NO! It would be much better it if there were several versions available - compatible with Sprint, Verizon...etc and if they were sold at a decent price without contract.

If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.
It’s time to put out the Fire! It makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud is not a strong selling point, especially when competitors like Apple are using 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon can commit to using modern energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.
Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. I am upset that one of the Fire’s key features, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, comes with a hidden and harmful cost. Unlike Apple and Google who have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s data centers are powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary.
I would give this item a higher rating if their cloud storage system used green energy - but it doesn't. Apple's storage system relies only on clean, renewable sources of energy. The "Fire Phone" system is powered by coal and gas. Storing your photos and other data shouldn't entail polluting the atmosphere unnecessarily. Amazon's "cloud storage system" generates a different kind of cloud - one that threatens a viable future for generations to come.

A fail on many levels. This was the w orst purchase I have made in a long time. I own a kindle fire hdx and have poved it from the start, but this phone is a swing and miss. I am unable to set up my email account or calendar without making major changes to my account. Amazons need to have everything in house and not use android or other ios is voing to be its downfall. If this phone used android or google operating system the phone would be decent. A SWING AND MISS.
Why AT&T;? Used it for a month. Wanted to throw it against the wall. Great phone! Love Amazon! The provider killed the phone experience. I gave it away as a gift! If it ran on Maybe Verizon. I would of been all in! Service was ridiculous.
Why the Fire is really a misfire. I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.

Didn't Light My Fire ...

What do I think of the Fire? Well whilst it has some of the common functionality we see in other phones, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.

Amazons first phone that has unlimited I cloud storage however what they don't mention is thaUnlike Apple who uses 100% renewable energy to maomaintain the storage Amazon does not and supports there storage by using coal, nuclear power and other means that pollute the environment. With the climate changing every day Amazon needs to do the same and not pollute our world using dirty energy.
Awful! just Awful! DO NOT BUY
How does the Fire pretend to be cutting edge when its key feature, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, is powered by outdated, dirty forms of energy like coal and gas. If other tech companies like Apple and Google can commit to powering their data centers with 100% renewable energy — so can Amazon.<br/>This phone takes  two steps backwards.<br/>Time to step up and take stock of your footprint. Then let's talk about cutting edge.
I had this phone for a week and I couldn't wait to get rid of it, this phone is horrible and pricey, dont waste your money. The biggest con of this phone is the lack of network flexibility, it should have been sold unlocked , AT&T; is the worst.

Yes I love dirty energy. I powered my own cloud server using used motor oil, whale fat, cooking grease pork lard.<br/><br/>Get a life people. your review has nothing to do with the functionality of the phone.
The Fire phone uses a cloud data storage, whose data centers run on coal and nuclear energy. In my opinion, this phone is no step towards a climate-friendly future. And it surely is not produced with fair conditions for the workers or with real interest in good materials (poison-free).
Only AT&T.; Huge negative.<br/>No Google apps available. (e.g.youtube, gmail) Huge negative.<br/>Beside those 2 negatives and the price, it seems like a cool phone.
I am completely underwhelmed by Amazon’s first attempt at a smartphone. The Fire is certainly not cutting edge when its key feature, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, is powered by outdated, dirty forms of energy like coal and gas.

Navigation on this phone is the pits!  No back button....still trying to figure that one out. Seriously, this is the most stupidest thing on this phone!  The camera isn't that great. Which was the main selling point that AT&T; made to me. The home screen is annoying, showing the last things or messages that you have done or received.  Doesn't seem to be a way to get rid of that! As soon as I can I'm getting rid of it!
Amazon’s data centers are powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary, in fact very harmful to our world and it future!
Did you know that Amazon uses dirty energy like coal and gas to power their cloud, which is their key feature in photo storage, unlike Apple, which uses 100% clean renewable energy to power its cloud! This day and age, a big company like Amazon should do much better.  Very disappointed in you, Amazon! I will not support the Fire until you use better environmental practices.

Terrible! Talk about being a hostage to amazon!!!  I can't even use my Starbuck's Card app on this thing.  What a joke and now am stuck with this POS as the 14 day return policy is up...

You use dirty energy (coal, gas[fracking] and nuclear power) to power Amazon's cloud data centers;  our world cannot afford such short-sightedness.  Switch to clean power, and I'll reconsider your product.
If you have any need of *anything* that uses the Google API, then avoid this phone like the plague. If I had known that I wouldn't be able to get things like One Bus Away or the PlayStation app to work on this phone, I wouldn't have ordered it. The OS isn't particularly intuitive, not being able to set my own custom notification sounds or ringtones is another major bad for this OS. The voice recognition just randomly craps out and I have to power cycle the phone to get it working again, and the web browser leaves a lot to be desired. The hardware seems fine, but the bells and whistles they add do not even remotely make up for the fact that the OS is horribly designed. For what I was looking for (and thought I was getting) this phone isn't even worth it when they are giving it away. I pray that someone in the mod community manages to hack Android 4.4 onto this phone. If not, then this will become a horrible backup MP3 player as soon as I can afford a phone with a properly useful OS.
Decent smart phone but it not comparable to the Galaxy line or iphone. Runs very slow and gets very hot when in use. This phone weighs A LOT. Probably 3 times my iPhone does. I will not be buying another phone from Amazon and I'm very disappointed with how Amazon designed this.
I agree with a previous review. Amazon has the resources to store data using renewables but chooses not to. Not exactly cutting edge.
I CANT DOWNLOAD OR USE CERTAIN DAY TO DAY PROGRAMAS LIKE WHAT'S UP.  IT TAKES ME TO SO MANY DIFFERENT APPS AND RUN AROUND JUST TO DOWNLOAD WHAT'S UP.  YOU HAVE TO BE ALMOST AN ENGINEER TO DO IT.  NOT FRIENDLY WITH THIS COMMON APP.
The cloud data for the Fire runs on dirty energy, coal, gas and nuclear power.  Apple's iCloud data runs on 100% renewable energy!
Only thing I liked was the size. After 3 weeks I gave it to my grandson. Operates more like a tablet than a phone. 24 hour support was fast and ineffective.
The only question worth asking is what is compelling about the Amazon Fire Phone? Ask any owner and they will tell you the same thing, "nothing really."  If you enjoy countless gimmicky features, being up-sold and locked into a proprietary Android platform this phone is for you. If you want a better battery life, better quality phone,  and android Google services on your phone look elsewhere.
Absolutely the worst phone I have ever owned. Amazon is no help with the problems that this phone has. If you are smart you will not get this phone.
First phone I've considered trading in my Windows8 phone for, except I would never go with AT&T; as a carrier, period. When this phone is available on T Mobil I might give it a spin.
phone came with defective headphone jack.  It took over two thirds of my alloted data from ATT just setting it up.  Button for volume too close to button to take photos.  3D only on home screen-very gadgety
Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. I am upset that one of the Fire’s key features, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, comes with a hidden and harmful cost.

Dirty...
Worst Phone Ever.
Just like all other amazon kindle it lacks a suite of services that Nexus provides like gmail, drive, google services. There are no alternative services provided by amazon as google does of that good quality.
I love this phone but will buy this when the price goes down to $100 without contract.
It's unnecessary that many of the Fire's key features, like unlimited cloud photo storage, are supported by Amazon's data centers that are powered by coal and other dirty energy. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon.<br/>AND<br/>Its a phone that will be outdated in a year and brings nothing new to portable devices. As consumers you can use your hard earned money as voice against companies like amazon.<br/>AND<br/>Amazon is delaying shipments of books, or removing preorder buttons for certain Hachette books: A ruthless tactic in price negotiations and creating monopolies. More people are getting screwed than in ‘Fifty Shades of Grey

Dear Amazon. Change to renewable energy and quit with coal, gas and atomic power - now! Do it like Microsoft and Apple and become a Leader in new, renewable energy. I dont buy stuff anymore at amazon until you commit to renewable energy.
Dirty energy.
I've owned many phones and some smart phones. I've owned all iphones pre-iphone5, and a galaxy s4. This amazon fire phone is the most frustrating phone I've ever used. I shouldn't have to go into anymore detail than that. If you like being frustrated, get this phone.
Hard to believe that Amazon is so behind Apple and Google as to run their data centers that constitute their "cloud" using dirty energy (coal and gas).  That's a deal killer for me. Apple and Google use 100% clean, renewable energy. Amazon, get with it!!
This phone is a poor example of corporate responsibility.Amazon should support clean energy. It has a big obligation to all the millions of people that regularly buy from its website. I am turning to alternative sources for products I regularly buy from Amazon.
Why the Fire is really a misfire. I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.
I am an avid Amazon customer.  Anything I want to purchase, I always check out Amazon first, especially because of my prime membership. My husband and I both have two Kindles, and I really wanted to purchase this Amazon Fire Phone.  Then I realized I would have to go with AT&T; and give up my Verizon.  No Way Jose!  Quite often I find that non-Verizon customers are unable to get any service, while I have never had that problem with my Verizon.<br/><br/>Amazon/Jeff..........if you offer contracts with Verizon, and I bet your sales will triple.
amazon, it looks like all you need to do for 5 stars is add the google play store, haha.... to limited version of android, its like a iphone, amazing specs though
Amazon’s cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power.
Phone broke less than a week after purchase. Plus amazon wouldn't replace it for me.
The sound on the phone is very poor,  I can't hear half of what is being said. And, everyone complains they can't hear me. Plus it came with out a guide book to operate it. So, who knows what it can do since there is no book.
If the system accepted no stars, that's what this Fire Phone would deserve.  It is reliably reported to be powered by dirty energy -- not by renewables. For heaven's sake, why would you do that?  Apt name, though.
would vote no stars if possible:  for using non-sustainable materials and practices - and cloud data centers run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power.

This is the best phone I ever had. I like it because you can see the date and time on the lock screen.
looking to get one does it have conference video didn't see it in the add. Like to video conference when I can.  I like it but would like to here more about the video conference calling.
Great phone
Maybe they should start with cleaning up their act and go green before they try their hand at phones.
I cannot get service where I live with AT&T;, I've called about it several times. I purchased the phone with you and HAD to use AT&T; as my server. Does it have a sims card from AT&T;??
Very disappointed to find out Amazon is not using reusable energy!!!! I was seriously thinking about buying this phone, but I WILL NOT CONTRIBUTE TO OUR PLANETS DIRTY AIR CRISIS!!!! We all need to do our part to keep the air we breath clean and keep our planet healthy so my children and theirs can enjoy this planet for years to come!!! I have been a huge Amazon fan for a long time, but I will switch to a different company like Apple, if you don't start using clean energy!!!!!
Environmentally unsound, I won't own one for this reason.

Although this offer is really tempting, the two year contract with ATT, their unreliable service and unwillingness to work with the customers are precisely the reasons that I terminated our association with ATT. If this phone was offered at a reasonable price across all carriers, (including our current Consumer Cellular) you may have better luck trying to sell it. At $600.00+ for an off carrier phone is not really affordable for most of us and although $449.00 is a lower price, it is still cost prohibitive for persons on a  fixed income. I am a 60 year old VET with some disabilities and my wife is getting there as well. We do not need 32g of what ever because we text very little as it is, so an extended data plan and whatever is just a plain waste of money.. That is another reason that we are with CC. Because theirs is a flexible plan that can be modified as WE need to.
I have never had a smart phone,so this is taking some time foe me to learn how to find and use everything.

awesome...
Whenever a company tries to eliminate consumer choices by signing exclusivity deal such as this AT&T; crap, the result will always be failure, otherwise it wouldn't have been a $0.99 phone. They should've learned something from the Facebook phone that ended up in the trash of history. You lost my respect Amazon.
Open this up to ALL Android apps. Please!?! Battery life poor. I will sell for $0.99 or best offer.

Leet me know when it is on Verizon , I'll buy 4that day!!!<br/>Great set of apps<br/>Good pricing<br/>Good looking<br/>Right size for me<br/>Do I need say more<br/><br/>Mike C
Looks like a really great phone. We have been on AT&T; and would not go back, even for this deal.<br/>If this phone ever makes it's way to metro, we'll be in line for that.
So here it is, finally a phone that raises the bar for all other phones (non-apple).  Amazon hit a home run with the innovative features building upon their quest for world domination.  For that I give them 5 stars!  That is the good news.  The bad news is I have experienced more bugs on this phone than any of the 37 devices I own and use for work, hence the 2 star review score.  Amazon, it is obvious that you have money, try spending some on some outsourced QA testing.  You cannot live inside a box and test with internal employees singing "everything is awesome".  The only way you will discover and be able to accurately address these issues is with in the wild testing.  You have countless users of your services, each user will have multiple configurations as well as other apps that trigger buggy behaviors that you will NEVER discover inside the walls of the Great Amazon Empire.  Think outside the bun, it worked for Taco Bell.  Do this and I can easily give your new phone a 4 star rating.  The 5th star will come if you eliminate the annoying "flick/tilt" features to view menus etc..  Great idea, but I am thinking it looked a lot better on the drawing board.
It looks like a great phone.  I would love to have it but ATT as the only carrier is a deal breaker :(  The coverage is very bad in my area and soon I will be moving just 15 minutes away in an area where there is no coverage at all!!  It would have been really nice if Amazon had offered this phone with other carriers instead of limiting it to just ATT customers.  Would be awesome if it came with a plan similar to net10 but it doesn't so basically the phone is pretty much useless with a service provider with such limited coverage.
User unfriendly-Returned. hard to navigate, no clear directions included and no match for a Samsung---thumbs down
i can  not  use  it  outside  USA  plus  it is  lock  you  can  not  open  .......

I've been off contract a couple years now and, last year, I tried picking up a similar deal with a different phone, and it was a disaster - I sent it back and went back to my old flip-phone and stayed with my existing Verizon plan. IF THIS DEAL were offered  with Verizon, I would have jumped on it - if I had not read some of the actual phone reviews that basically acknowledge the "nice try," but fall short of accolades for the equipment. So, when the phone is improved AND offered for 99 cents with a Verizon contract, I'll be there. Until then I'll just plug along with my old flip phone, sans contract.
I love all these new people who "Love" this phone.  Wait until you actually want apps that you use and they are unavailable.  My major chain drug store doesn't have an app that works with the phone.  They have an iPhone app, and an Android app.  Just not an app that works on the Fire Phone.  My car manufacturer doesn't have an app that works with the phone.  They have an iPhone app, and an Android app.  Just not one that works with the Fire phone.  My favorite is this...I used to use PayPal with a card reader at my business.  Accepting credit cards was easy.  Well, PayPal doesn't work with Fire Phone, so I had to switch to Amazon's Local Register.  Amazon has a Local Register app that works with an iPhone. They even have a Local Register App that works with Android.  But guess what they don't have?  You got it!  An app that works with their own phone!  If I want to take a credit card at my business, all I have to do is bring my 3rd Generation Kindle to my place of work.  Or better still, I could use my old iPhone hooked up to the internet through wireless and I can get my pharmacy, my auto, and PayPal.  Why do I have this phone?  I will say for Amazon, I like the camera.  After 6 months with the phone, I'm tired of jumping through hoops trying to use it.
Unlimited photo storage in cloud relies on dirty energy.
Many of Fire's key features, like unlimited cloud photo storage, are supported by Amazon's data centers that are powered by coal and other dirty energy.<br/><br/>If Amazon matched competitors like Apple by powering their operations with clean and renewable energy, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.
The Fire could be MUCH better in terms of energy efficiency when providing a service like unlimited photo storage. Amazon's competitors power their cloud with 100% clean, renewable energy, and Amazon should follow suit. Storing photos, music and messages should not be linked to climate change.
Why the Fire is really a misfire. I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.
I would LOVE to own this phone. However ... I hate ATT and their extortion prices, and their two year contract is just BS. I've used ATT for five years because I was locked into iPhone. Never again. High prices, lousy customer service, locked phone, locked contract, and they don't care anything about their customers. Never again!<br/><br/>On the other hand the phone looks awesome. Unlock it so I can use any carrier and I'll buy it. But never thru ATT.
I would love to try the Fire Phone.  Get it on something other than AT&T; and I'm there!
Misfire! I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.
It’s time to put out the Fire! It makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud is not a strong selling point, especially when competitors like Apple are using 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon can commit to using modern energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.
C'mon, Jeff - stop hiding your energy consumption details! As the folks from Greenpeace want me to say, "Why the Fire is really a misfire. I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud."<br/><br/>And, is it made with slave labor, like the Foxconn factory in China where iPhones are made?
I bought the phone without contract in order to use it with another carrier but dah!! it's locked to at&t; and only amazon resolution is to return the phone!! they didnt care at all.!!
at&t; is the worst carrier ever. I would never buy a phone tied to at&t;
The Fire could be MUCH better.I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.

Horrible. Do not buy this.
Please follow the lead of Apple, Facebook and Google and use renewable energy to produce this phone.
Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. I am upset that one of the Fire’s key features, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, comes with a hidden and harmful cost. Unlike Apple and Google who have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s data centers are powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary.

No renewal energy source for your data centers. Using dirty fuels for power.  No support from me

Ok i have read quite a few reviews. My thing is this..i have had att uverse, for two years. Then i purschased a phone for my teenager son for christmas, THROUGH ATT,ADDED ON TO MY CABLE SERVICE...att didnt dissapoint me at all with my cable service and internet service..i perfer att UVERSE over comcast any day because my price stayed the same for two years..when i purschased my sons iphone 4 my bill went up a little , but i would get award cards from att so that pleased me...So now i really want this phone ,but im a google freak,  and i use google maps for NAVIGATION CAUSE I LIVE IN ATLANTA and i dont know how to get around without googling. ..im a prime member and a att pleased customer...but i need and love my google play games.,,so the price drop has really made me want to buy the phone, but if i cant have google apps, ill just stick with boost mobile(40)dollars a month and stick with my LG phone...Other than that ..Amazon the offer sounds great but we smartphone lovers,, LOVE OUR GOOGLE APPS ,SO PLEASE RECONSIDER ADDING GOOGLE APPS. Between having google apps AND AMAZON THAT WOULD BE A FANTASTIC PHONE AND I WOULD GLADLY PURCHASE THE FIRE PHONE
Dirty Coal powers this phone's ICloud ap. Don't buy it
"cloud" data centers run on dirty fossil and nuclear energy, endangering the planet.

Buyer Beware! The first issue was turned over to development team, I have never been called that issue fixed. Today bluetooth issue turned over to development team, when I asked to be kept informed, rep stated 'I dont want to do that' - buyer beware!!!
Amazon’s cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power.
Nice phone with great hardware specs.  Problem is, no access to Google Play Store, and no Google Apps.  This is a deal breaker.  People don't care so much about great specs and slick features, they care about what their phone will do for them.  Approximately 250,000 apps on Amazon, approximately 1.2 million on Play Store.  Bust.
Run by Dirty energy.
No smartphone that uses dirty coal powered energy for unlimited cloud storage deserves more than a one star rating.  Follow your competitor's example and use renewable energy sources to power your cloud storage, and your rating will go up.

Amazon needs to up their game on supplying products based in renewable energy!!
It's a fun phone and easy to use.
Not run on clean energy!
I love my Fire phone!!!!
I was thinking about my first smart phone....really thought it would be through you..but I wouldn't if its bad for the planet. I am disappointed.

The phone is heavy and the camera is difficult to use
Amazon's cloud center run on energy from coal, gas and nuclear power.
Let me save you from the major roasts. This phone is Garbo like you won't get any girls with this phone. I bought this phone and someone called it one of those cheapy bucket firefly phones, everyone started to laugh. Even the teacher was laughing. After the terrible experience I had to endure I took the Amazon Fire Phone and had it ran over with a Food4Less bigrig. At that moment I thought all of the roasting was done... But to my surprise it wasn't.<br/>For a birthday gift my parents got me an other Amazon Fire Phone. My life got demolished all of the roasting was too intense for me, I just couldn't stand it anymore, so after I post this I'm going to jump off a cement making factory.<br/>So in conclusion the phone wasn't that bad, has a good CPU and camera would buy again.
Can't get music without buying them.
Runs on non-renewable, dirty energy.

Good
Use renewable energy at your data centers! Shame on you, Amazon.
BIG REVIEW!!! Listen Amazon!!! Marketing for this phone is not up to consumer expectancy. In a world where apple and google run the market share... This can be a success but needs more marketing than anything else. what VALUE does this add to my experience that i do not already have?!@??

The phone met my low expectation.  Rating is my judgement compared with alternative Android smartphones and how poor Amazon's executive management performed in bringing this inferior product to market. Have had experienced with Amazon's modified Android OS since the first Amazon Fire  was launched which I rooted and upgraded to Android 4.2 after the warranty expired.  Thus, I can use Google Play and additional apps on it.  The cons of Amazon's first-generation Fire phone to include AT&T; as a service provider have been well documented.  Purchased since Amazon paid me $98.01 (additional year of Prime - $0.99) off their hands, it has a very good camera, and it performs the functions I need satisfactorily.
Pretty whimpy, not what I expected especially for the money
it don't good at all......have to wait and cuts off....
The Fire runs on dirty energy:  gas, coal, and nuclear.
Why is Amazon still using dirty fossil fuel energy..  Come into the 21st century with renewables like many other sites.

Amazon..stop using dirty energy!!
Amazon prides itself on customer satisfaction, but I'm definitely not satisfied with the Fire. I can't support a device that needlessly stores all my music, photos, and videos in data centers powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. If other tech giants like Apple and Google can commit to powering their data centers with clean, renewable energy - so can Amazon. Get your act together, Amazon--we all know you don't have to use energy that harms the entire planet and everyone who lives on it, and leaves the real cost of this phone and its storage to the next generations, not to mention those already suffering from the effects of the use of these energies.
I want to buy this phone.. I love all the features.. it looks FANTASTIC... except for the AT&T; thing... nope.. sorry Amazon..  give it to me on Verizon for the same 99 cents deal and I will buy it, and love it and tell everyone about it..  but AT&T; sucks
so bad, i expect to receive a unlock phone as it show on the website with the full price that i bought...but now what i got is a lock phone with the full......i recommend for who want to but with out service plan if you dont have a at&t; sim please dont buy it....
Let me start by saying I have been an Amazon fan for years. Amazon has outstanding customer service. Sadly, however, ATT has terrible customer service. I have heard complaints from family and friends for years about ATT's customer service. For the years that the iPhone was teamed up with ATT I wanted an iPhone but passed because of this. However,  being such a fan of Amazon I broke my vow of not using ATT and got the fire phone promoted by Amazon with ATT. Though I really like the phone I regret getting it because I have already first hand experienced ATT's lake of care and appreciation for their customers. They can be down right rude.
Please think about poering your cloud with renewable energy instead of dirty energy (coal,gas,nuclear) and I might conseder purchasing one. Thank you.
A valiant effort for a first generation mobile phone but fails to convince conversion from iOS or Android. The highly publicized dynamic display is useless, and quite frankly annoying. The WiFi antenna never seemed to work properly during the two weeks I attempted using the phone as my everyday device. It's just not a great device!!!<br/><br/>PROS<br/>Screen size<br/>Headphones<br/><br/>CONS<br/>Everything else

I support Greenpeace's campaign in favor of clean energy by posting the review they recommend:<br/><br/>"Where there’s smoke, there’s fire.

Seeing as Amazon dodges taxes in the UK, surely they could afford to put some of that extra cash towards using clean energy to power their Cloud and other servers instead of fossil fuels?
Calling this just a phone is like calling Batman just a superhero or Jesus just a savior.  While I've had other phones, this one has absolutely changed my life and made me a complete person. Just when you thought that the world had enough smart phones, Amazon completely filled a huge void that absolutely needed filling by this wondrous marvel.  My life was empty until now but WOW, thank you Amazon!  I am now free to realize my potential and along the way call some friends too.  AWESOME!
Needs many improvements
The phone itself is just fine and I like pretty much verything about it.  The one blaring problem is ATT, why oh why do they not have an unlimited data package?  They charge and arm and a leg for data usage, so although my phone can do a bunch of awesome things, I can't use any of them without constantly going over the data limit.  So it's pretty pointless.
The Fire deserves a 1-star review because if Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy then Amazon can too.  One shouldn't have to chose between storing photos, music and messages and the survival of the human race on Planet Earth.

I like the phone. There are a few missing features.<br/><br/>Voice control for directions<br/>No SD card slot<br/>It doesn't have a back button. It show up on the screen when the page opens.<br/>When your on FB messages there isn't a back button. You got to slide screen up and hit timeline.<br/>Can't transfer data from previous phone. The retail  store Cellbrite machine  doesn't have software for FIRE yet..

Cloud run on dirty energy!
I am VERY DISAPPOINTED by Amazon’s first attempt at a smartphone. The Fire is certainly not cutting edge when its key feature, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, is powered by outdated, dirty forms of energy like coal and gas. If other tech companies like Apple and Google can commit to powering their data centers with 100% renewable energy — so can Amazon. GET ON BOARD WITH REVEWABLE ENERGY!
Maybe is an awesome equipment but amazon seems to me didn't think about users abroad US, i got the mobile with a NON AT&T; plan assuming the phone could work with any mobile carrier but is not like that.. instead AT&T; has an exclusive agreement with amazon and all the phones are locked up.. On top of it once i apply for returning the mobile... there is no returning policy applicable for this phone only replacement... As a result i lost 750 USD on a cell phone that i wont be able to use.<br/><br/>Big Fail for Amazon that didn't think on overseas customers at launching season.<br/><br/>I do not recommend this items for users abroad US.
It might be a good phone but I won't buy it until Amazon goes GREEN WITH IT'S ENERGY USE!  YOU SELL EVERYTHING ELSE...SELL SAVING THE PLANET TO YOUR OWN COMPANY!

Too bad Amazon couldn't make it easy to operate this phone.  Come up with a simple, straightforward service plan and then you have something to get excited about.  I'll keep searching.

Had higher expectations! The Fire’s key feature, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, is supported by dirty energy like coal and gas. Amazon could easily commit to powering their data centers with 100% clean, renewable energy like Apple and Google, but they don’t. Until Amazon chooses to embrace better environmental practices, I refuse to support the Fire.

The Amazon Fire phone looks amazing. And I love Amazon's products.<br/>I own an Amazon Kindle Fire which is the best pad on the planet. Better than the Apple or Samsung pads.<br/>But I refuse to do business with AT&T.; Let me know when the phone is available for Sprint customers and I will consider it. Until then, I will stick with my Samsung Galaxy 4 which is pretty good.
I think it’s completely unnecessary that many of the Fire's key features, like unlimited cloud photo storage, are supported by Amazon's data centers that are powered by coal and other dirty energy. If Amazon matched competitors like Apple by powering their operations with clean and renewable energy, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.
While I would be interested enough to consider an Amazon Fire Phone, it has many drawbacks.  First, you can only get it through AT&T.;  I hate AT&T.;  Their service is no better than anyone else's, but, you pay much more for it.  Second, you can't change the battery yourself.  You have to send it in somewhere.  Talk about inconvenient.  Not to mention, they can charge you an extra fee for that too.  I saw on the news this morning that the sales of the Fire phone have been so bad, they had to reduce the price dramatically.  Here's a thought Amazon, WHY NOT LET OTHER CARRIERS SELL IT AND LET US HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE OUR OWN BATTERIES?!  Otherwise, it would appear that the Fire phone is going to have a realtively short life.
iPhone Users Don't Buy...if you have an iPhone and like all the things it does, sets a calendar event by touching a date in a text or email, making a phone call by simply touching a phone number, seeing your text message on the lock screen, seeing who your missed call was from on the lock screen and the list goes on and on..these are a few of the things YOU can do on the iPhone but CAN NOT do on the Fire Phone.<br/><br/> Me and my husband just got these phones last week and we will be taking them back!  I will stick with my old 4s until a new iPhone comes out.  It stinks that we have to pay a $35 restock fee per phone, but it will be worth it to have our iPhone back.<br/><br/>Wish I would have read the reviews first!
Not worth it in the least! Not enough room to list all the problems.
Sounds great except AT&T.;  I have had a range of phones with AT&T; in different markets (Seattle, DC, Boston) over the last 20 years.  Same with Verizon and T-Mobile.  The reception, and particularly internet bandwidth, with AT&T; never lived up to their advertising, and their customer support amounts to "tough luck".<br/><br/>Where is the micro-SD option?  Play right from Apple--$100  for additional 32GB storage.  You can find class 10 64 GB cards for $15.<br/><br/>One year warranty?!?<br/><br/>Amazon can also afford to provide full phone backup, not just select files.  5GB is stingy (better than iCloud or Dropbox, but even Microsoft gives you more for free).<br/><br/>I really want to ditch my iPhone 5 (esp. after iOS 'upgrade' that refuses to charge with non-Apple/licensed cables), and this is the first full featured Android phone with a size that fits in a pocket.<br/><br/>I am hopeful that Amazon will keep the size down with a future phone that has the SD expansion.  I would even but the unlocked phone outright  in spite of other flaws if this was the case.
It’s time to put out the Fire! It makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud is not a strong selling point, especially when competitors like Apple are using 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon can commit to using modern energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.

Ditch the fossil fuels that power you your data centers and support your cloud storage, as Apple has done. No Fire for me until you clean up.
for it's unlimited storage feature.<br/><br/>If I could give it negative stars, I would.  Amazon is powering its storage feature facilities with coal and gas, not renewable energy.  I detest Apple and Google, but at least they are using sustainable energy at their storage facilities.  SHAME ON YOU AMAZON!
Where there's smoke, there's fire. I am upset that one of the Fire's key features, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, comes with a hidden and harmful cost. Unlike Apple and Google who have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, Amazon's data centers are powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. The Fire's reliance on dirty energy isn't cutting edge, and it's completely unnecessary.

I chose not to upgrade to a Fire because of the energy sources used to power Amazon's cloud -- it is long past time for Amazon to switch to renewables -- the cost of solar and wind is now comparable or cheaper than coal, and both are definitely cleaner than natural gas.
Phone was not smooth in operation. Hard to set up,external speakers were Tinney sounding. It was a waste of my time to order it.
I just learned that Amazon needlessly stores all music, photos, and videos for the Fire in data centers powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. If other tech giants like Apple and Google can commit to powering their data centers with clean, renewable energy, why doesn't Amazon???
Amazon’s cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power.
Why the Fire is really a misfire. I am very disappointed that as Amazon's first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn't that "smart." Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. "One Star" from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.

Quite frustrating to realise that Fire's cloud photo storage is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. One would think that Amazon would honour the name of their company by being more environmentally-aware, right?
This one star is just for presentation the phone is a total waste of money especially it is advertised as unlocked and AT&T; locks the entire system not recommended for use outside the US

I am disappointed with Amazon's Smart Phone "Fire".  The unlimited photo storage is supported by "dirty energy" like coal and gas.  Amazon could use clean renewable energy like Apple and Google.  Until they do I will not support Amazon's "Fire."
Runs on "dirty" energy......there is NO NEED for that in this day and age!<br/><br/>The Fire could be MUCH better.I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage.

I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.
Beware - the Fire is powered by outdated, dirty forms of energy like coal and gas. This is NOT cutting edge technology! If other tech companies like Apple and Google can commit to powering their data centers with 100% renewable energy — so can Amazon.
Don't use dirty coal!

Until the "unlimited cloud storage" this device comes with is powered by renewable, clean sources of energy (as is the case with Apple, Facebook, and Google), it will only get one star from me.
Can't support a phone that's created by a company that won't discuss it's use of dirty, planet-warming fuel.

I don't like that the Fire’s unlimited photo storage in the cloud uses data centers powered by dirty energy like coal and gas, whereas Apple and Google have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy is completely unnecessary.
Well first wan
Moved up to this from a Galaxy SIII. regretting my decision. A 3 year old device is more fully featured than this trash. John Legere was right. I'm moving to T-Mobile!

Excellent! I had some reservations but really like Amazon so I gave the new fire phone a try and WOW was I impressed, great device with all the things I love about Amazon. This is the phone I had hoped for.
For many years I had to use ATT service (always of the "good ole" ground line phones) but I grew to detest the many ways the monthly bills were padded up with artificial charges. When it was possible to escape to another service I pounced on the chance to change. Amazon is losing out with what appears to be an excellent phone  by packaging it with ATT,

i was promised a kindle fire hdx for $.99 if I bought the amazon fire phone, but it was fraud I am telling everyone I know fraud
It has multiple software problems. It's not ready for public sale. I sent it back!

I returned this phone in under 24 hours. Undoubtedly the worst phone I've ever used. Boring, blah and not user friendly
AMAZON IS NOT SUPPORTING CLEAN ENERGY!!!<br/>ANY COMPANY THAT DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE PLANET WE LIVE ON DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE 1STAR!!!<br/>THE PLANET IS WELL-DONE NOW!!! STOP COOKING IT MORE!!!

I don't have a Fire Phone. My wife and I own 3 Kindles between us. I like the Fire phone, but I also like Verizon as my carrier. Till the Fire arrives to Verizon, I won't be owning one.
The problem with this phone is that the immense electricity requirements of Amazon's Cloud Storage uses mainly dirty fossil fuel generated electricity unlike Apple's Cloud Storage that uses 100% renewable energy. I'll stick with Apple until Amazon fixed this glaring problem.
I was looking for a solid Android phone with strong hardware and a customizable interface. This was none of those.
Can't believe you're OK with using dirty energy (which we've been fighting!) for fueling this!!  Please get with the good guys, Jeff, and change your ways!
Unlike Apple’s iCloud which is powered by 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power.
Looks like a very nice piece of tech. - all the right wistles/bell  . . .  A.T.&T.;  =  Deal Killer.  They lost my biz. yrs. ago and will not see it<br/>again until there is not one other option for me.  Too Bad -  You sold me, otherwise.
DON'T GET Fire phone:  Lacks in simple phone functions like speed dial.  You can mark your contacts as favorites, but that's all you can do.<br/>So far lots of the apps provided for free by other phones and free from the developers, you have to PAY on this phone (like Night Owl Security cam, GoPro control).  Amazon Prime is "free", but with the CHARGES that you will have on apps that are usually free you will pay for it in 1 year.  The biggest item is the Dynamic perspective gets old fast as most of the free apps are for 10 y/o kids (pet  monkey) and the others... well you have to PAY for them.  I have made several purchases on Amazon, but had no need for the the firefly function as if you are smart you will review other sales online from other suppliers before making a purchase.<br/><br/>Bottom line:  You pay for free apps, phone is NOT SMART, what makes the phone unique is useless.
To many problems connection to towers,wavey picture,,no google app. When these and other problems others have had I would buy another (2) two.
I would never buy a phone that is powered by dirty energy: this is my statement to Amazon to encourage and demand that you use 100% renewable energy. I do not think we should sacrifice our environment to store data. Thank you.
Why would Amazon use unclean energy to store data? If Apple can do it, Amazon has the resources to store data without relying on coal or gas.
Gave it 1 star because I can't do zero stars<br/>The only thing I can think of that is worse than the fire phone is amazon "customer service" I always get routed to a call center in India whose idea of being helpful is a comment like sorry about your luck.... screen goes black and phone becomes unresponsive.... it turns of without warning... this phone belongs in a landfill... amazon should rename it the amazon garbage phone... with the bull s*** I have gone through with this phone for 17 days now and the lack of service I've gotten amazon has lost a customer
I hate it
Be green!
Amazon’s cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power
This phone is horrible ! Won't charge so I sent it back, got another one same problem . Customer service SUCKS !!!! WORST EVER
I want able to get all my apps
It's not as great as Amazon makes it. It sucks
still learning what is on it.
doesn't use renewable energy
Hate the idea of dirty coal powered cloud storage. Unlike Google.
This phone sucks..not even worth the 99 cents I paid for it. All this is is another version of a stupid iPhone..
Well I'm glad I decided to read the reviews before buying. Shame, Shame on you Samsung for putting out a pcs of junk and shame on amazon for releasing before testing first as it's not like you to get behind a pcs. of junk. I see that you have dropped price down to .99 cents I assume to unload them and after reading the reviews I think free would be too much for a 2 year contract with the phone from hell to say nothing about AT&T; as the carrier. Sorry Amazon I think your stuck with a bunch of phones from hell and the worst carrier out there...
Nice device but definitely a "No Buy" because the incredible Fire price drop to 99 cents comes with the hidden cost of its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power Amazon's cloud infrastructure. Compare this to Apple's 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon really wants to compete and be an industry leader, it's time they joined the 21st century by committing to use modern energy sources.
It's unnecessary that many of the Fire's key features, like unlimited cloud photo storage, are supported by data centers that are powered by coal & other dirty energy. If competitors like Apple can power their data centers with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon.

Horrible!
Upset that your smart phone is so dumb!<br/>Cannot believe it is using DIRTY energy!!!<br/>Come on Amazon, what are you doing?<br/>It's past time to commit to CLEAN energy!!!<br/>I have loved this company but was appalled recently to learn about your refusal to go CLEAN...<br/>I had no idea.  I expected better :(
Can't afford it don't want contract,

This phone is produced and supported by dirty, not clean, energy.  It's not the best phone ever as well.
I don't have the phone.  Primarily because of AT&T;'s exorbitant fees.<br/>So I won't try it.<br/>If Amazon teamed up with Republic Wireless, I might try it.<br/>But it gets 5 stars from me to counter the thousands of fake 1 stars put here by environmental fascists.
It's cloud is dirty, powered by coal.
Still trying to figure it out
I bought this because it was from Amazon. What could be wrong? I was wrong.
not at all what I was expecting, sadly I'm not very happy with the Fire OS.
This phone is a big let down

Amazon.com carries a branding name that does not deserve. Deserving it means not only to be BIG (like the Amazon) but also being conscious of the ecological issues affecting our world (the Amazon and everywhere.) Yes, the Fire could be MUCH better.  Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy and I give you five stars! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages. But if I have to choose then I will choose Apple, because they are doing more for the environment.
It not that exciting as I thought. I can barely download any thing

I cannot understand how people have come to allow technology to take over their lives. This "stuff you cannot live without" has created obsessive compulsive behavior in America.  People with their eyes glued to tiny screens, walking down the streets of major cities; lured to distraction while driving their cars,while sitting in public places etc.No time to converse face to face with friends neighbors, no facial expressions to indicate and reflect comprehension and moods.. Sad. Very sad.
I am a 8 year Verizon customer and a die hard Amazon customer... even have Kindle Fire HDX. But Jeff screwed this up big time with an exclusivity relationship with AT&T.; Sorry Jeff... love you buddy but this was a complete loss for us VZW customers.

Dirty Energy needs to be disengaged from the powering of the cloud for Amazon.  Apple's cloud is powered by 100% renewable energy.  Now is the time to put your money where your mouth is @Jeff Bezos.

Not the newest technology, because the newest technology would be associated with green energy. It's electronic, that's good, maybe even energy efficient, but Amazon's company and its services are associated with using coal and other fossil fuels more than other companies. Amazon needs to step up and have their headquarters, warehouses, factories that made this phone, and any other buildings, and all of their online services powered by green energy.
Shame on you for not going green. We can't afford to use up our fossil fuels. I use your site all the time but you're making it difficult for me to continue to do so.

Uses dirty energy
Fire Sale Phone, rather.  This is a toy to play with in kindergarten.  Get a pachinko machine instead; at least you'll have fun using it.
Why the Fire is really a misfire. I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.

Didn't Light My Fire ... I think it’s completely unnecessary that many of the Fire's key features, like unlimited cloud photo storage, are supported by Amazon's data centers that are powered by coal and other dirty energy. If Amazon matched competitors like Apple by powering their operations with clean and renewable energy, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.

I am a dinosaur.  My first (ha ha) cell phone came in a bag and weighed 8 pounds.  My wife got me a real cell phone a few years ago and I have been happy.  I am everything Amazon and a Prime member.My wife found a great deal on the Amazon Fire Phone, until (shades of Ma Bell) we found it came with AT&T; only.  Good-bye Fire, hello IPhone.  WHY DIDN'T YOU POLL YOUR LOYAL CUSTOMERS?
I understand that Amazon powers it's cloud data centre's on fossil fuels with high C02 emissions, unlike the Apple i Cloud which uses renewable energy. Time to look at the whole production process and make some changes.

Had higher expectations! The Fire’s key feature, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, is supported by dirty energy like coal and gas. Amazon could easily commit to powering their data centers with 100% clean, renewable energy like Apple and Google, but they don’t. Until Amazon chooses to embrace better environmental practices, I refuse to support the Fire.

The first comment I ever read about the Fire was from The Verge following its announcement, and this is an exact quote, "This thing is going to crash so hard."<br/><br/>That wasn't even my comment - but it completely summed up my reaction on seeing the specs, the stupid 3D gimmick, the obvious attempt in Firefly at roping the user into the Amazon ecosystem, the gall to price it at the high end of the market. I mean, not even mentioning the carrier lock or the Amazon Appstore, which I actually didn't care that much about. Mostly, for me it was their wasting countless hours of human development capital, a deep well of consumer goodwill, Earth's finite mineral resources, and even the opportunity to bring to market some kind of solution to any problem, and they ending up putting out a turd of device that doesn't improve the state of the world, or even make it more fun, in any way.<br/><br/>Fire phone, you were just a turd out there. You couldn't kick and you couldn't run. You were just a turd.
I did not purchase this because I'm a Verizon Wireless customer, and after seeing the underhanded tactics AT&T; has been using lately, I'm not switching. Amazon, please make a version for Verizon.
I hate it it wants gigs an drains battery like crazy I would rather have my old slide phone than this
This phone sucks. I don't like it!
It’s time to put out the Fire! It makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud is not a strong selling point, especially when competitors like Apple are using 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon can commit to using modern energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.
I don't like it ' android is better!
The Fire could be MUCH better. I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.

As above love the phone wedding confusion lost charger and case I will pay for them gladly!
My 10 year old daughter loves it.
Firstly, UPS did not deliver my Fire phone even though their tracking status said delivered. When I called them they were ignorant and said order an replacement. I am prime member and UPS delivers to my house every week. Did UPS steal or was it a scam by AMAZON? Anyways, after a 24 hour wait and almost 3 hours spent on the phone, amazon did mail via Fedex a replacement device after 4 days.<br/><br/>Secondly, I paid full contract price, almost $700 being a loyal amazon fan. I am no more one and will most likely cancel my membership and return the phone.<br/><br/>Lastly, Actual phone review: If you are a Iphone user, don't get it. This thing is a copy from Iphone that went bad. I give 2 stars to amazon for trying by nothing new and fresh as I was hoping for.<br/><br/>No notification banner for text or email? Are you kidding me? How did you miss that amazon?<br/><br/>Its a basic smartphone with nice display and that's were this things end. Feels uncomfortably in hand but keypad is solid.<br/>Camera is very basic and firefly is annoying.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Don't get it if you are an advanced Smartphone user.

I am completely underwhelmed by Amazon’s first attempt at a smartphone. The Fire is certainly not cutting edge when its key feature, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, is powered by outdated, dirty forms of energy like coal and gas. If other tech companies like Apple and Google can commit to powering their data centers with 100% renewable energy — so can Amazon.<br/><br/>The world turns, and we must play god whether we like it or not!

Amazon use your business sense ..... AT&T; didnt you learn anything from APPLE ...... AT&T; sucks big time .. you are limiting yourself to just one sucky network ..... poor choice
How can I support a device that needlessly stores all files in data centers powered by dirty energy like coal and gas? If other tech giants like Apple and Google can power their data centers with clean, renewable energy - so can Amazon.
Excellent. Could'nt be better
I really don't like the commercial for the fire phone it make adults look stupid and why would I buy a phone for my kid if he/she is going to make me look like an ass. That what I get out of the commercial for the fire phone. I was looking forward in get one by look at it but after I saw the commercials for it decided not too.
Amazon, please wake up and be a leader by dumping dirty energy. You have the power to make the world a better place--use it.

I tried my friend's Amazon’s Fire but will NEVER purchase one until amazon stops relying unnecessarily on dirty energy. Storing our photos, music and messages shouldn’t mean we are forced to damage the health of our climate and communities. Apple, Facebook, and Google have figured out how to store our photos and music with renewable energy, and so can Amazon.

I don't understand why my Fire can't use clean power, like Apple does, to store my data.

I haven't bought the phone yet but I could use a new phone.  After reading the reviews, I came up with two opinions.  One, I am suspicious of reviews that go on and on and on.  Some of those people may be telling the truth but some of them may not have Amazon's best interest in mind.  Two, when I got to the iphone people not liking the phone and their opinions, I really get suspicious on whether they ever even saw an Amazon phone.  iphone people have to be out of their minds to spend a fortune on Apple equipment.  So I don't give much stock in their opinion.  So I haven't decided yet and will keep studying the Amazon phone to see if it beats my Samsung S4.
With a name like Amazon this company should have green ideals.

Was going to definitely get but since does not support google apps it's now a no go. Come on amazon!

This phone is a good idea for a little younger and then you will be able to be a t travel to the world of you who have not seen since the first to comment on you to do so in the world of s west coast of the first to comment you on the most popular has to be a little bit further than you can comment on a little bit of my life in the first place in using a new one that I am looking forward to be able to seeing you have a good thing to do with a little more than you can finch

I am very disappointed to learn Amazon is not being powered responsibly as is Google.  Why not?  Money/profit chosen over the earth's<br/>resources just doesn't add up.  Please rethink your decision.  This review is not about the Amazon Fire Phone.  It is<br/>about Amazon.com in general.  Thank you.

Ridiculous! $600+ for a no-contract phone with specs from 2013. Apps are limited and it is locked down to AT&T.; Why is it relevant that I mention AT&T;? Because it DIRECTLY affects the functionality of this phone. A PHONE ( you know, the one you make calls on) is only as good as the voice/data service you receive with your carrier. Unless, of course, you plan on using WiFi all the time and not make calls. Such exclusive deals do hurt customers and in the end will hurt the business. So yes it is fair to rate the phone based on the carrier.<br/><br/>If you're upgrading from a phone that's 2+ years old AND are tied to the Amazon ecosystem then go ahead.<br/><br/>Final note to the trolls. Read the reviews. If THAT many people are giving 1 or 2 stars to this phone because of AT&T..; then MAYBE just MAYBE it is fair to rate phones based on carrier.

Amazons cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power.
Why the Fire? The recently released Fire phone’s major boast is its unlimited cloud data storage ... but there’s a BIG catch. Unlike Apple’s iCloud which is powered by 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power.
first time I've reviewed. I love amazon, and fire products, etc. but I cannot believe the offers on the fire phone! to only go with att. absolutely not! and the cost comes out way over the $700 supposed price tag. Not unless you it is offered with Verizon or another, any other, provider!!! sorry amazon.
Not cool on the coal.

I am sorry that I didn't read the reviews before. I thought I was getting an android phone BUT I can't get any of my apps including chrome, gmail, hangouts...common! No wonder no one is buying it. I had faith in amazon, but it let me down...
Works great has good features just missing some apps that I need

No support system. cannot be repaired! I cracked the face on mine and they told me that my only option is to purchase a new phone. Buy a phone from a company that cares about the customer. Run as fast as you can away from this one!!!!

Until Amazon chooses to embrace better environmental practices, I refuse to support the Fire.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, former climate change denier AT&T; also supports dirty energy policies but as a current customer I cannot switch my provider as I have no choice but to remain with them due to the relatively low cost I pay.  If there was another company I could be with, and pay less than $55/month for my phone/Internet connection without loss of income, I will have to begrudgingly remain with AT&T.;

Uses dirty energy to power its cloud storage. Stop using Mother Earth's excrement as your energy source.
I did not buy this phone.  Why?  Because your cloud servers are run on dirty energy.  No excuse.

It was too complicated for me to use .I am 82 and unfortunately not proficient with this device
There is no way I would consider using a phone that blocks me from the Google Store. And this phone is based on the Android platform. What are the people at Amazon thinking????
Didn't Light My Fire ... It's unnecessary that many of the Fire's key features, like unlimited cloud photo storage, are supported by Amazon's data centers that are powered by coal and other dirty energy. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon.
Why did you have to get in bed wiht AT&T;?
If the unlimited cloud storage were run on green renewable fuels I would provide more stars but until then RETHINK YOUR FOOTPRINT MR. BEEZOS!
We live in a time and age where we know better, and we know better than to use dirty non renewable energy. Amazon, better clean up your act!
This Smarthphone works in Colombia south America?  amazon movies dont work here!
The Fire could be MUCH better.<br/>I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do MUCH better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage.<br/>If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon.<br/>Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy!<br/>I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.<br/>Green up, Amazon!
It’s time to put out the Fire! It makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud is not a strong selling point, especially when competitors like Apple are using 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon can commit to using modern energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.

WOULD NOT WANT IT FOR MYSELF  AND WOULD NOT GIVE AS A GIFT  CLEAN UP YOUR ACT
need to be more eco friendly
Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. I am upset that one of the Fire’s key features, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, comes with a hidden and harmful cost.

Amazon releases dirty air into the atmosphere from its cloud.  I don't know how Amazon can live with itself-I can't live in its dirty confines. Dirty air is responsible for keeping me within my home an unable to leave the house. We have to have 8 clean air filters as it is. I have a friend who lives in the downtown Denver area in a tall condo. She can't come down below the 14th story of her condo. Therefore, she is, like me, alone in her gilded cage. What the hell is wrong with you, Amazon? Why are you allowing your customers to die horribly in order to sell something else?<br/>I resent your presence in this world.
Awful
dirty

My friend has this phone and it's really great! The firefly feature is the best part and beats the competitors' phones by far. Plus, this phone works great with the accessories at earhipster.com

Why the Fire is really a misfire. I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.
Amazon prides itself on customer satisfaction, but I’m definitely not satisfied with the Fire. I can’t support a device that needlessly stores all my music, photos, and videos in data centers powered by dirty energy like coal and gas.

Booooo, Amazon! Get with it! CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY!
Amazon exploits its workers and treats them terribly.

Had it four days, charger wont charge.  Tried other chargers still won't charge.  Not real happy with this product right now.
Are you serious????

Can't recommend this phone because one of the Fire’s key features, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, comes with a hidden and harmful cost.

The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary. When Amazon commits to switching to renewables to power our future, then I would consider this phone worthy of comparative shopping and deserving of a real review.
While at the AT&T; store, I played with one of these awful phones.  This is by far the worst phone I have ever tried.  The interface was a joke.  The cameras were even a bigger joke.  I tried the 3D like feature and it was so bad.  One person looked at this feature and felt sick.  Put it this way, right next to Amazon phone was a booth that had iPhone 6 and 6+, there were around 30 folks, taking turn looking at Apple phone and only 2 were at the Amazon's booth.
I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire is ANYTHING but smart! Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud. You would think that with all the people that support Amazon with our dollars spent, they could commit to caring about our planet and its resources. Shame on you, Amazon!

It took us a long time to get out of the EXPENSIVE 2 and 3 year contract requirements of AT&T; and Verizon.  This just looks like a back-door way of getting people stuck in that nightmare again.  No Thanks!  I love my Buy-As-You-Go service, which has always provided better service than either AT&T; or Verizon.  Beware of the hidden costs AT&T; will hit you with.
No dirty coal.

Wish I could like this but so unfortunate that Amazon's cloud storage is not up to standard using dirty energy sources that deplete our planet's environment. Using this phone is just not worth it when there are cleaner alternatives.
Not Green enough!
Cloud storage should run with 100% renewable energy

They refuse to post their energy usage and its the worst phone ever!!!
Had higher expectations! The Fire’s key feature, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, is supported by dirty energy like coal and gas. Amazon could easily commit to powering their data centers with 100% clean, renewable energy like Apple and Google, but they don’t. Until Amazon chooses to embrace better environmental practices, I refuse to support the Fire.<br/><br/>yeah, it's a c&p; review, but using dirty energy is worse!!
This phone is not very good. I hate that many apps I loved on the samsung S4 are not allowed on the fire phone...if Att&t; would let me switch I would in a heartbeat and if Amazon would credit my account for the cost of this phone I am now STUCK with, I would consider changing this bad review.
I was seriously considering this  product until I received the word that your Cloud data centers are powered by dirty energy.  It's time to clean up your act, Amazon!  I'm buying an Apple iCloud instead.
This phone's cloud is supported by polluting and inefficient forms of electricity like coal and gas. Until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud, they will continue receiving terrible reviews!!!!!!<br/> DO NOT BUY!!!!

Can't even get the apps I want. Every time I call to see if I can get a app, they tell me, they don't have it yet. But google has it. Fire phone does not.  3/4 of the time this phone is in searching mode looking for AT&T; signal.  This phone cost me $199..00 and I had to wait because I ordered it.  NOW...... You can get it for only .99 CENTS!!!!!  That's because no one wants it.. BECAUSE ITS *****!!
The cloud is powered by dirty coal, unlike Apple's cloud!<br/><br/>Don
Well, I was looking at an unlocked Fire phone to use with a Sim Card. The Phone is not unlocked for $449, but still tied to ATT. this is stated clearly in the full price section. So I would pay full price but still be tied to a carrier? No Thanks. I'm sorry this isn't a review of the product I purchased, but after seeing that restricting and considering this device, I have to post a review.
goood

I AM EXTREEMLY SAD & ANGRY THAT I CANT USE MY GMAIL ACCOUNT, WHICH IS ANDROID.
What a piece of junk? Worst battery life ever seen on any smartphone. Had to charge 4 times in day. Nothing nice to say about phone. It gets really hot as well. I prefer better battery life than dynamic perspective gimmick. On top of that I didn't found it useful.
Shame on you!!!! When are you going to contribute to our Children's Enviroment? We will leave it to them and they should not clean up your messes for NEW products in the name of Profit!

Amazon is not doing its part to protect our natural resources, their environmental policies rate the lowest. Apple and Google are committed to using 100% renewable energy while Amazon tosses aside the importance of protecting and preserving our resources which include clean air, water and soil. Amazon needs to commit to preserving the earth and our resources before continuing to pollute.

Except for the #1 that is on the message envelope that says i have 1 msg and i dont the phone is all good..
The Cloud is unsustainable. I will not use a product that pollutes the air or water. Apple iPhone is Better
SHAME ON AMAZON!! This corporation has more than sufficient funding to participate in clean, renewable energy usage.  This swell new phone does NOT rely on clean energy, just dirty, killing coal.<br/>Maybe one star, maybe none.
If I pay full price for a phone there's no way it should come locked to any service. I should be able to go to any provider I want. Thumbs down for that feature.
Amazon's reliance on dirty energy isn't cutting edge it is OUT!  Outdated!  Outsmarted!  Just out!  Getting on board with clean, 100% renewable energy.  Be hip and forward thinking not stuck in the dirty oil past!!!

Very disturbed to learn that the FIre relies on  dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud.  Given that Apple uses 100% clean, renewable energy, the lower price at such a cost to the environment is not a selling point.  I hope Amazon will switch to using clean modern energy sources.<br/>Concerned Consumer
It sucks do not waste your money I tried selling it after I tried using it and i only got 25.00 for it I'm warning right now do not get it

the cloud storage is powered by energy that is not sustainable unlike other companies like apple!
Even at 99¢ Amazon’s Fire is too expensive: Its reliance on dirty energy such as coal and gas to power its cloud for unlimited photo storage is a hidden cost that makes it a bad buy. If Fire relied on modern energy sources such as Apple’s doing with their 100% clean, renewable energy, that would be a different story altogether.
It runs on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power.
I would have gotten one, but I won't/don't use at&t.; I'm stuck getting the Nexus 6 when it's released. Amazon's loss is moto's gain. Good job guys! Way to marginalize anyone not using at&t;!

This is no where near iPhone. It appears to be a copy paste of iPhone but not easy to use and not worth for money compared to iPhone and android phones.
I was thinking about buying one of these phones but att's new pay by the month plan is such a rip off.  I tried this phone in the store and it did nothing!  What a disappointment.  Guess ill go with a htc go phone for now so i dont get ripped off by att. if Amazon wants to sell a phone for such a outrageous price then make a outrageous phone.  This was is pure disaster!  Wish i didnt have to give it any stars!
Since the phone's cloud is powered with fossil fuel energy instead of renewable energy (like the iPhone) it deserves no more than 1 star.

I was with AT&T; for over 15 yrs, I paid $355.00 to come out of their contract. For so, so many months of over charging, countless hours, so many calls I made to their retention deptmt, no one KNEW their job, Never a contract again w/ AT&T;
The Fire could be MUCH better.I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.
Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. I am upset that one of the Fire’s key features, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, comes with a hidden and harmful cost. Unlike Apple and Google who have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s data centers are powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary.
Amazing uses dirty energy!
Like the features but extremely disappointed that the Fire cannot accept Imessages.  Most of my contacts have iphones and can only message me if they convert to regular text initially.  Major deal breaker for me and considering returning it based on this issue.<br/>Very short battery life too.
Misfire!

I can give you all you need to know about this phone in several sentences. If you only use your phone for is texting, calling, and eReading you should buy this phone. If you care at all about an effective software interface or apps in either the Apple Store or Google play store DO NOT buy this phone.
After I sold my one and only daughter to an Italian mafia down the street I was able to buy this great phone off contract, and let me say, it's totally worth it! I don't even miss her- but more about the FIRE Phone. This beastly baby comes with AVERAGE specs, I mean whoa, slow down Amazon, I can't take all this awesomeness. The best part of that is that it's wayyyy overpriced for features that, when you think about it, can be done on almost any android phone with a software update from Google. But who gives a damn, right? My girlfriend even wants to kick me out now, huh, guess who's jealous of my badass phone. Who needs a bed when this bad boy is warm enough to lay on all through the cold nights! Thanks Amazon!
What a shame.  Even coming late to the party, they are Amazon with a HUGE well-deserved fan base, and they truly had an opportunity to do what Google did with their Nexus but  they blew it. By hog-tying folks into a locked service plan commitment with only one provider AND modifying the operating system so much it forces you (not invites, forces) you to stay in their world, AND not making the unlocked version more reasonably priced, Amazon missed the mark on this. While Apple has a unique product to do something like that, Amazon doesn't.  I have a funny feeling you're going to see these go the way of the dodo bird, even after suddenly dropping the price to .99
This is so unfortunate. The Amazon Cloud is fueled by "dirty energy". I am not impressed with this at all.

Didn't Light My Fire.... its unnecessary that many of the Fire's key features, like unlimited cloud storage, are supported by Amazon's data centers that are powered by coal and other dirty energy. If competitors like Apple, Google, Facebook, etc. can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon.
Not powered by renewable energy. Do not buy.
It’s time to put out the Fire! It makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud is not a strong selling point, especially when competitors like Apple are using 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon can commit to using modern energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.

I'm in the market for a new phone, and would consider this one, but have been disappointed to read that Amazon's cloud is powered by polluting forms of energy that cause climate change, like coal and gas. Given that so many other tech companies are moving toward renewable energy, I can't understand why Amazon would let itself fall to the back of the pack like this. Seems like another iPhone for me (with a wind/solar-powered iCloud) until Amazon gets its act together.
I hate at&t; .. I would buy it if not At&t; please get another provider and more apps.

Shame on you for using fossil fuels.  You are a big part of the global problem
I support clean renewable energy.

Too bad Mr. Bezos is not a leader in fueling his companies with green energy. LP
very nice phone i returned it because no one could sync my contacts, photos, or calendar.<br/>truly disappointed.<br/>also the mayday feature only worked once.
You know why.

Terrible Phone not worth the price even for $199, only good if you wanna give this to your grandparents but for yourself it not worth it. There no Google apps such as youtube
The phone sucks too many glitches
Clean Energy please!!

Wow there is really no better phone then the fire phone iean it's dynamic perspective is simply amazing great graphics and for the fire it's the details that count fire fly wow great app searches for over 100,000,000 millions of items camera is great did I mention it has unlimited data..... yep it is the greatest phone also for the May day button wow I think it's even better then the kindle fire HDX 8.9 great graphics it runs smoothly I especially love that the dynamic perspective has also other purposes and I also love that it's an A&T; exclusive awesome phone I'd think it's a bran New technology.  And btw I think Amazon's "competition" should step it up if they don't want to be bought by amazon.  I love amazon I have the kindle tablet the fire phone and the fire tv and I love that amazon are very original and Cate about each customer not a million customers well that's my review enjoy!!!#
Cloud should be powered by 100% renewable energy, not dirty fuel sources.
Doesn't come with the Google Play store. This is a horrible Android phone. Going with the Samsung Galaxy Note 4.
I am a long time user of Amazon and AT&T.;  I would love to upgrade my  phone to the new Fire phone but I am not going to give AT&T;  40 addition dollars to flip a switch to change phones.  Sorry, this is not a product review but needed to state my disappointment out loud.  Better to be a new user than old faithful!
I have to say, this is the worst phone on the market.  It was a good try.  In addition the limitations of apps and inability to get rid of the AT&T; app preloaded on the phone hinder the enjoyment.  Also, due to Amazon's insistence to utilize dirty energy in their production and operations....  You can be sure that you added significantly to climate change if you support Amazon and their products.  You will have a hand in the deaths of millions.

It's not the phone that is so bad but the fact that Amazon's cloud is not the big clean white fluffy kind. Nope, Amazon's cloud  is the big black dirty kind that is made of the polluted air from non-renewable energy that powers the Amazon cloud. Clean up your cloud and the phone would be even better.

This phone is not worth the listed price of $450 if a Fire HD 6 Tablet can be purchased from Amazon for $99. Add wireless to the 6" tablet and sell it for $149.99. If Chinese and Indian manufacturers can make much better smartphones and sell at $100, it just shows that margins for smartphones are astronomical. Amazon should sell this Fire Phone unlocked at $149.99 and make it available across all networks including T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon. Follow and learn from the leader - "Apple" The offer of $0 down payment from AT&T; is a strategic suicide as subscribers will still have to pay the monthly cost which translates to more than $450 over two years. No one is going to fall for a gimmick. It does not make economic sense if you are a laggard. Consumers will pay anything to get an iPhone 6 but not for a Fire Phone.

Played with UI features at a store.  Kinda interesting ... for about 30 seconds.  Crippled, fake Android.  There are a number of free Android phones, not to mention iPhone 5c, that are free and way more useful.

This does not use renewable energy sources and will cause more pollution than other smart phones.
I love amazon, I already have two kindles fire, I would like to have the phone, but where I live, we don't have AT&T; services.  If it was an unlocked phone that I could use with the service provider where I live It will be super.

Not eco friendly
If Apple can make a smartphone whose cloud services run on clean, renewable energy, so can Amazon. If to use these products means we have to forfeit a livable climate, then these products suck.

Would like to purchase but am so done with AT T  and contracts in general. I feel that Amazon has sold us down the river by associating with AT T and sent back a Fire HDX for that reason.  I am tired of being forced to interact with companies that have terrible service to use the products that I prefer.  Why did Amazon do that?  They have such wonderful tablets and service. Drop AT T and see how much happier their customers are then!
there are some things  I don t like about it.

It's time to commit to Clean Energy Amazon!!
I really wish it wasn't a At&T; exclusive. I'm a long time Sprint user(over 10 years) and I'm up for a renewal and really wish I could have purchased this phone through Amazon.
Too high price for this kind of phone. :-(
Found out a major bug. If you want to use a SIRI-like voice assistant app, forget it. The fire Phone android hybrid OS doesn't recognize anything beyond google search for voice recognition.  Buyer beware!
Won't let you call local stores.  Wants you to use Amazon
Buy an iphone instead of Fire until Amazon is willing to come clean about their environmental impact and commit to working towards sustainability and clean energy.

Runs on dirty energy, unlike Apple's.
You need to use renewable energy for your cloud services.
I don't like the fact that Amazon data centers are supported by dirty energy such as coal! The features on this phone including the "cloud photo storage"depend on energy from your data center. Please go green and use clean energy! I am an Amazon customer.

Since I'm an AT&T; cell customer already and need a smart phone I thought I'd look into the Fire what with it's unlimited cloud storage. Then I found out that Amazon's cloud servers are powered by dirty energy like coal, gas and nukes. If Apple, Google, and Facebook can use 100% renewable energy for their server farms so can Amazon. When Amazon comes "clean" I'll reconsider the Fire.
"Amazon’s cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power."  Clean up your act Amazon, literally.

I am completely underwhelmed by Amazon’s first attempt at a smartphone.  The Fire is certainly not cutting edge when its key feature, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, is powered by outdated, dirty forms of energy like coal and gas.  If other tech companies like Apple and Google can commit to powering their data centers with 100% renewable energy, why can't Amazon?
Uses dirty energy to store data in it's cloud.  That's so 20th century.
This relies on non-renewable resources and harms our planet, unlike other major retailers.

Amazon prides itself on customer satisfaction, but I’m definitely not satisfied with the Fire.

Amazon's cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power unlike the competitors. Storing our photos, music and messages shouldn't mean we are forced to damage the health of our climate and communities. Apple, Facebook, and Google have figured out how to store our photos and music with renewable energy, and so can Amazon. #Greenpeace
Had higher expectations! The Fire’s key feature, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, is supported by dirty energy like coal and gas. Amazon could easily commit to powering their data centers with 100% clean, renewable energy like Apple and Google, but they don’t. Until Amazon chooses to embrace better environmental practices, I refuse to support the Fire.
Not working outside US.

The problem I have with this phone is that it is on only one carrier. This will be the downfall for this phone when diehard Amazon customers like me cant use the phone. I am on Verizon and like my carrier but with this on AT&T; only I am stuck with my normal selection. If you notice that the IPhone was not restricted and did well. It probably would not have done as well being restricted to one carrier.
This phone is manufactured using coal and other "dirty energy". I would like to purchase it if it was using clean energy like others in the industry.

I've been using this phone for about a week after I first wrote this review. This phone is impressive in many ways, but still disporting in some. I bought this phone with no service plan, which I thought was "no service plan", but the trues is "no service plan YET", u have to go get an ATT account for this phone. When I went to ATT store for information, they told me that only apply in America. If you travel to other countries, it will auto unlock the phone. There is nowhere stated that no service plan is still ATT only, and the auto unlocking when going abroad. ATT only in US is still suck for me. The speaker on the phone is not as good as I thought it would be. There is the ear piercing thunder sounding at maximum volume. The headphone that came within the box was good though. I like the design which made it easier to store, and the sound quality was great. Since I haven't transfer to ATT, I install this wechat via apk and tried to text with my friend on wechat. The battery goes away so fast. It cost me 2% every 3 to 4 mins. The phone was very hot when I was using it on the first day, and I have no idea why was that. It was all good after that first day. Although it does get hot very fast when you play games. When I hit the top bottom, and then hit it right after to turn the phone on, it will stock at grey background for a sec before the luck screen shows up. I dont know if it means the cpu is not actually that fast.(Well, it won't happen if I use iPhone) The camera is really good. I love the pictures it took. I do not know how to describe it, but it's much better than iPhone. The firefly really makes life easier, it was amazing what it can scans. I dont feel to buy anything on the computer anymore, just firefly it.<br/><br/>What I like:<br/>1. The headphone came along was great.<br/>2. the camera is perfect.<br/>3. The firefly is amazing.<br/><br/>What I Dont like:<br/>1. ATT only = suck (Although its only for ppl within US, says ATT)<br/>2. Speaker is bad, has the thundering sound at MAX sound level<br/>3. Battery dies fast<br/>5. Not sure if its really that fast.

The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary.
Come forward about your energy consumption. Alternatives to dirty energy are most definitely in your price range, unless you already have them.
I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.

I would love to get this new phone. It looks amazing. However it is only available for AT&T.; That was a bad move for amazon. I want the phone but AT&T; service is not good. They should make the phone available for other carriers like Verizon and sprint as well.
Unlimited cloud storage, powered by unlimited dirty energy!  Commit to 100% Renewable Energy for AWS!
Nice Camera, good sound, nice 3d effects. Other than that,  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
Dirty energy is not ok.
I was considering purchasing this phone but I haven't been in a contract for some years and do not wish to go into another lock in. I have AT&T; internet but do not want to pay an enormous amount for monthly service as I have Boost Mobile and currently pay $40/mo with their decreasing monthly payment plan (started at $55/mo (smartphone plan), every 6 mos paying on time they lower it by $5).<br/><br/>If they offered this phone on Boost Mobile network, I would probably buy one for myself, daughter, and niece. The phone should be offered on more networks at a reasonable price and would probably fly off the shelves and have people on waiting lists.

good afternoon I want to know if this phone is unlocked and can be used if outside the United States specifically in Venezuela .. Thanks
looks like a iphone 5 copy cat
Dirty, slow, inefficient
I miss my iPhone :-(

Revolutionary! Sign me up.
Waste of money.
dirty energy source
This phone runs on dirty energy like coal, gas, and nuclear power.
It’s time to put out the Fire! It makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud is not a strong selling point, especially when competitors like Apple are using 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon can commit to using modern energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.
One Star because you restricted the to AT&T.; I will never use AT&T; there will never get your phone. Sorry your lost for restricting me

Maybe if Amazon didn't exclusively discount the price for only AT&T; then I'd consider it buying it. The coverage for AT&T; where I live is horrible so this phone is worthless for me.

ANY NEW PRODUCTS SHOULD NOT USE DIRTY ENERGY!!!!!  I WILL NOT BUY THIS, OR ANY NEW PRODUCT THAT USES DIRTY ENERGY TO PRODUCE THE PRODUCT OR STORE DATA!!!!

I expected more from Amazon.  Amazon's Fire Phone is powered by coal and other dirty energy sources.  I will have to rethink my use of Amazon.

Didn't Light My Fire
If they every give us the option for Verizon, then I will get it, not with AT&T.;  Terrible service in my area.  Also the battery life has to be much better than it currently has.  I would not want it for FREE as long as AT&T; is the provider.  Give us the  option of Verizon as you do on the Kindle Fire, then just maybe I will take it for the $0.99.
Husband's new phone.  He has a tough time learning new things.  I want to help but the best I can do it go to tutorials.
Looks like a fancy phone that works well with the content I purchase regularly on my kindle paperwhite but I can't believe that a company known for its innovation in service providing is using dirty coal power to power its servers/cloud. I would much rather pay additional cents for all the stuff I buy off amazon than help drive extinction, pollution, respiratory disease, and mountain top destruction through coal power. Its ironic that Amazon is in the last millennium in terms of energy usage...
No friendly fire here.....
Doesn't light my fire, Amazon uses dirty coal energy for it cloud storage. Go apple or android instead.

Sorry, I'd like to try this phone, but I don't use AT&T.;
If Amazon wants to offer its customers a modern phone, it should start by powering its operations with renewable forms of electricity like the wind and solar power currently being employed by its competitors.

How can you say this is a best seller when Guardian says only 35,000 total phones were sold to date?<br/><br/>Here is the link:<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>Amazon has sold no more than 35,000 Fire phones, data suggests<br/>Amazon doesn’t give sales data for its devices, but figures from comScore and Chitika suggest only modest sales so far<br/><br/>Amazon’s Fire Phone was launched in July, after many teaser videos and an expansive unveiling by chief executive Jeff Bezos, who showed off features like its 3D-effect maps and multiple front-facing cameras.<br/><br/>But since then, how many Amazon Fire Phones have actually been sold? How many are in use?<br/><br/>There were many interesting anomalies in the launch of the Fire Phone. The $200 price tag for a 32GB version on an AT&T; contract – the same price range as the iPhone 5S or Samsung GS5 – was a surprise to those who thought that the Kindle and Kindle Fire tablets showed Amazon as a low-end disruptor, selling hardware at cost and profiting on the content.<br/><br/>Amazon gave the Fire Phone pride of place on its US web site, and also had a deal to sell through AT&T;, the biggest US carrier - though reviews were lukewarm.<br/><br/>Amazon famously never gives sales figures for any of the devices it sells, preferring to let its financial results do the talking. Analysts can make estimates of how many devices have been sold, based on their information from sales channels and any guidance the company might give. But it’s not as definitive as, say, the smartphone sales that Apple or BlackBerry include in their financial figures. (They are now the only two companies which give specific values for device sales in their financial results; Apple goes farther by giving the revenue from those sales too.)<br/><br/>But we can have a stab at estimating how many Fire Phones are in use, based on data from Chitika, which runs an ad network.<br/><br/>According to a release from Chitika, looking at activity on its ad network in the 20 days after the Fire Phone’s release, the Fire Phone accounted for 0.02% of activity - although a more precise figure, in another graph, shows it as around 0.015%.<br/><br/>Chitika data on Amazon Fire Phone use<br/>Chitika’s graph showing ad impressions in North America for the Amazon Fire Phone (compared with the Motorola Droid Ultra) in the days following its release. The Fire Phone has about 0.15% of impressions. Photograph: Chitika<br/>OK - but how many phones might that be?<br/><br/>Using data from ComScore, which provides monthly data on US smartphone users, we can get close to a figure.<br/><br/>The most recent data from ComScore covers the three months to the end of June 2014: at that time, there were 173m smartphones in use in the US, it said.<br/><br/>That figure is rising by between 1m and 2m a month - so two months later, by mid-August, when the Chitika data was collected, we could estimate that there are between 175m and 177m smartphones in use in the US.<br/><br/>We also have to assume that Amazon’s Fire Phone will show up on Chitika’s network as often as any other phone - so that their web use is comparable (ie one iPhone in use will show up on Chitika’s network as much as one Samsung or LG or HTC or Amazon Fire phone). We’ll look harder at that later.<br/><br/>Based on the ComScore data:<br/>• 0.015% of 175m = 26,250 Fire phones in use<br/>• 0.015% of 177m = 26,550 Fire phones in use<br/><br/>Split the difference, and it’s reasonable take 26,400 as a median value.<br/><br/>Indexing: the over and the under<br/><br/>But what if Fire Phones “under-index” on Chitika’s system - that is, they don’t show up on its ad networks as much as other devices, because their users are (for example) all spending time on Amazon buying things, rather than browsing the parts of the web that Chitika supplies ads for?<br/><br/>To explain “under-indexing”, imagine there are 100 owners of device A, and 100 owners of device B, and 100 of device C. If owners of A and C use their devices online an equal amount of time, but device B owners spend only half their time online, a system that measures web impressions will report that there are half as many owners of device B. One would say that device B “under-indexes”. Alternatively, if you have equal numbers of A, B and C, but device A owners spend twice as much time online as B or C, then device A “over-indexes”.<br/><br/>A Chitika release in August seems to suggest, for example, that the iPhone over-indexes: it had 52.3% of Chitika web traffic, though iPhones are about 40% of smartphones in use in the US.<br/><br/>Android devices (including Fire Phone, which uses a forked version of Android) do under-index - though not much. The same Chitika survey that shows the iPhone over-indexing gives Samsung a 22.8% web use share, and HTC a 3.1% share . Correction: Chitika’s US data in August shows Samsung with 26.4% of web usage, and HTC with 3.0% of web usage.<br/><br/>That compares to ComScore’s data, which shows that Samsung smartphones are 28.6% of the installed base, and HTC are 4.8%. (BlackBerry devices under-index on Chitika, making up 0.5% of browsing, but having 2.4% of the installed base.)<br/><br/>On that basis, you could argue that if the Amazon Fire Phone under-indexes, it probably isn’t by much; you could multiply the number by 25%, based on the average of the Samsung and HTC figures. That takes you up to about 33,000 devices.<br/><br/>Therefore even allowing for margins of error, it seems unlikely - based on Chitika’s data and the ComScore data - that there were more than about 35,000 Fire Phones in use after those 20 days.<br/><br/>Amazon had not responded to a request for comment on the calculation by the time of publication.<br/><br/>Lots of caveats apply: this is a calculation based on two non-congruent sets of samples, though both are large enough to be robust.<br/><br/>So is 35,000 phones good or bad? Bezos said that Amazon was in it for the long run and that it intends to be patient. Chitika comments that “While Amazon certainly is looking to make the Fire Phone a hit, current conditions show this being more realistic as a long-term goal rather than a short term one.”<br/><br/>Observers felt that Amazon had to get into e-commerce through phones because it risked being disrupted itself as more shopping - even the physical sort - moved to apps.<br/><br/>So far, though, the Fire Phone looks more like a curiosity than a barnstormer.<br/><br/>Correction: the calculation for under/over-indexing originally used the UK dataset from Chitika but compared it with the US installed base.
The phone is nice. Not sure which is the problem. The phone or the phone service. Bummed that I have a hard time using Google. Facebook freezes up a lot.
Sucks battery life is crap wish I wouldn't have got one
There are a few things that went HORRIBLY wrong with this phone... I believe the first of it's many downfalls was deciding to carrier lock it by not allowing it access to many more bands and choosing AT&T; as the carrier... The next downfall was the INSANE pricing on/off contract... The fact that you can get a Nexus 5 off contract for half the price unlocked, you have to an idiot to lock yourself in to way fewer carrier options with a subpar phone in comparison... I had really high hopes for this phone thinking that Amazon could bring in some additional competition into the wireless field... I was wrong :-/
Some cool things but still far behind high end phones
The Fire could be MUCH better. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.
As long as you use DIRTY energy sources for your data center, I won't even CONSIDER the Fire Phone.  Actually, it's aptly named considering it uses COAL fire for support.  UGH!!!
Did Not like this phone at all!
It's unnecessary that many of the Fire's key features, like unlimited cloud photo storage, are supported by Amazon's data centers that are powered by coal and other dirty energy. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Amazon should be the leader for innovative means of reducing their carbon foot print, instead of adding to it.
its a fantastic idea that this phone has unlimited cloud storage space, HOWEVER, the fact that I recently learned that the company uses dirty energy to power their cloud service (coal, gas, nuclear power), it changed my opinion drastically. In a world where the environment and our climate is greatly threatened by our consumerism, we should be taking every step at doing the most sustainable and environmentally moral thing. climate change and the environment should be at the forefront of our concerns. Had the company decided to use a renewable source of energy to power their cloud i would have easily given this product 5 stars.<br/><br/>we have a greater responsibility to this planet and to ourselves than we do to profits. Money and financial gains are man made, they can be undone and redone again. this earth must come to hold more value than our profits. we must take the harder route and do everything in our power to promote environmental sustainability, in everything we do and every product we sell.<br/><br/>amazon, you a LEADER in this consumer driven world, people and other companies look to you because you have power and influence. The course that your company takes must reflect larger more complex ideals other than profits and money.<br/><br/>Make history or be vilified by it.
Didn't light my fire... What's the point of so many features and many things on cloud that use dirty energy which would end up harming my future. When everyone else can do it, so can you Amazon! Switch to clean energy, switch to 100% renewables.

Amazon, say no to dirty energy!
Cloud storage should be run with 100% renewable energy. This device does not meet this criteria, not even close, it is therefore going to contribute to massive increases in global warming and pollution through the burning of fossil fuels.<br/>For the sake of our planet and our children I would not recommend this gadget! Shame on you Amazon, shame on you for being so irreverently irresponsible. Shape up and right your wrongs or you will continue to lose customer support. For anyone reading this, Apple uses renewable energy to run their cloud storage, go support them and DO NOT SUPPORT AMAZON.
Stop using oil and gas to power your phones.
Switch your cloud center to clean energy.

A friend showed me his new Fire Phone. I have not decided yet.  I love Amazon and this seems to be an improvement over stock Android. However, the dearth of apps and the battery life are probably deal killers for me.  There is not enough of a differentiator over iPhone. I think to be competitive with the Apple ecosystem, they are going to need to drop the price by 50% and get a few more decent apps.  Maybe next iteration.  It's a great first attempt, but just doesn't stand out in my opinion.  If anyone can get it right, it's Bezos, so I'm not writing this off.  I will wait for gen 2.
I've bought two amazon fire phone from www.amazon.com, I've paid the full amount of the deivice to be used outside the U.S.<br/><br/>but when I change at&t; sim card to replace with another carrier sim I get an msg saying " Enter Network PIN code".<br/><br/>I don't hold at&t; account nor live in USA, So I can't get the code.<br/><br/>Who can help me?
Worst phone yet don't buy it here it's a waste of your money buy it at a store like bestbuy,staples,...

Dirty phone - after some comparison research I cannot support a company that has no concern for our environment.
Just reading about how the Fire will use Amazon's data centers for cloud storage is enough for me to not want to buy or use this phone.  You see, Amazon's data centers use coal and other dirty energy as fuel, whereas companies such as Apple use clean, renewable energy.  As someone who is a loyal Amazon customer, I don't like writing a bad review for one of Amazon's own amazing gadgets, but in this case, I felt I had to speak out, because I am also committed to reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and improving the quality of our environment.  If Amazon switched to clean energy, I'd be more likely to buy it.  And I would certainly give Amazon a much higher rating.
Poor
I am completely underwhelmed by Amazon’s first attempt at a smartphone. The Fire is certainly not cutting edge when its key feature, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, is powered by outdated, dirty forms of energy like coal and gas. If other tech companies like Apple and Google can commit to powering their data centers with 100% renewable energy — so can Amazon.

This phone has unlimited data storage on Amazon's big dirty cloud computer that uses tons of non-renewable energy.  Unlike Apple and Google, whose data centers use clean renewable energy for their cloud data storage.  Come on Amazon, get with the program and help us save the climate and our planet! We can no longer afford to use dirty fossil fuel powered energy!

So disappointed your cloud storage is dirty! Match your competitors and go green!
Not one thing about the customer. Proprietary Android mess of an OS that only uses Amazon's store. Hardware specs on par with a 250.00 mid range phone. Premium 500.00 price tag. Tied to AT&T;, the worst carrier in the USA with massive dropped calls, poor customer service, and constant dropped calls anytime you're more than 5 miles out of a major city. OS spends most of it's screen estate to advertise at you, videos have ads and more. It is a free phone experience with a mid range hardware handset and premium price tag. Do yourself a favor, get a different phone. ANY phone.

This Fire is fueled by fossil energy.  0% renewable.  100% unsustainable.  Go to Apple or Google.
The resources and energy used o manufacture and manage this phone is irresponsible.
This would be a huge mistake to buy this phone when there are so many better choices ... For cheaper! Get the nexus 5 or one plus.  Nexus "6" should be coming out soon too in October.
Amazon isn't hearing us
I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.
I would really be interested in the phone, AT&T; as a service provider is a non starter for me.  I know this isn't really a review, but just wanted to voice my gripe
Misfire!

Amazon's energy policies make the cloud storage feature of this phone unacceptable.

As a loyal Amazon customer I am hoping you will make the right decision to be part of the solution! and discontinue your practices that exacerbate the  problem!
Really wanted to purchase three of these phones, but because it is limited to AT&T; Service Agreement only, Will not be doing so.  What a shame.  Perhaps in the future a better plan will be available.

Amazon is a multi billion dollar business so do the right thing and take the lead on clean energy. Thanks.
a power hog
Misfire! I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.
It’s time to put out the Fire! It makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud is not a strong selling point, especially when competitors like Apple are using 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon can commit to using modern energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.
I am somewhat interested in the Amazon phone. But the sales pitch says that I can pay two hundred dollars and that covers TWO YEARS. What comes after? What other possible costs are there? This seems like a very limited device for that kind of price. OH...and I've already seen Amazon's idea of Apps for the kindle; what a horrid waste land. Not even my grandchildren can find any interest there. RCR

Powered by dirty fuel. If smaller companies with less money can use clean power why can't Amazon?
Amazon's cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power.  You can do better.
Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. I am upset that one of the Fire’s key features, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, comes with a hidden and harmful cost. Unlike Apple and Google who have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s data centers are powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary.
I love it
The #1 reason I didn't buy this phone? AT&T.;<br/><br/>Give me Verizon and I will consider it, otherwise I'll stick with my Droid.
I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review basically because Greenpeace told me that Amazon is not powering its cloud with 100% renewable energy, unlike its competitors (e.g., Apple). Also, I hate Amazon because of its exploitative labor practices. Here's hoping my review makes Jeff Bezos weep tears of frustrated greed.

I don't like it at all
Won't buy from you because your cloud is not fueled by renewable energy.
Cloud storage is great but running the data centers that store the data on dirty oil coal and gas is inexcusable.  Apple uses 100% renewable energy to power their data centers, its time Amazon does too
It's time for Amazon to invest in clean energy for its company. Google, Facebook, and many others have committed to renewable energy. Amazon you are behind the times, and you are an embarrassment.
The Fire could be MUCH better.I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage.

Come clean on what powers cloud storage.
The radiation is harmful!<br/>Don't use this phone!

I am very upset to learn than Amazon's first smartphone is connected to a sourcce of polluting power.  The main feature--unlimited cloud photo storage--is supported by forms of electricity like coal and gas.  As an Amazon customer, I feel disappointed that Amazon has not stepped up to the plate like competitors such as Apple, who have committed to clean and renewable energy to power their cloud. I would hope you would rethink this and make changes.

I would really like to buy an Amazon Fire Phone but I have no desire to use AT&T; or pay $100+ per month form a phone plan.
EXTREMELY expensive monthly plans...
Probably a good phone but the key drawing feature of unlimited cloud storage is based on servers powered by dirty energy which is the root cause of the climate change crisis and adversely affects both we and our offspring...no amount of cloud storage is worth the trade off of a ruined environment...

Amazon could easily commit to powering their data centers with 100% clean, renewable energy like Apple and Google, but they don’t.

I can't get behind the Fire Phone. Its unlimited cloud photo storage is powered by coal and other dirty energy, when Amazon could easily make the switch to renewable energy. Your customers are waiting, Amazon!

No Google, you have got to be kidding. Hey Amazon, wake up. I love Amazon Prime etc but this phone is a joke. Open up to other carriers and make a superior phone that just isn't afraid of sharing content. Oh brother, how disappointed...
I'm a fan of Amazon and Kindle. I have a Fire HDX and absolutely love it. But the Fire Phone just can't compete with Apple or Samsung. Why try???? Unless they get a bigger App Store, Fire Phone will fail. Case in point, the phone has been out for 11 days at the time of this review and my local AT&T; store hasn't sold a single Fire Phone.

Use clean energy please. You have the power, money, profits to change. Enough greed. Use your corporate profits to do the right thing, set an example and well, DO WHAT WE WANT AND WHAT IS BEST FOR ALL, NOT ONLY THE 1%. We<br/> are onto this game....
No google maps and no gmail!!!! Really!!!<br/>User Interface looks totally different from other android phones.

i'm thinking about this phone?????? fixing to start a new busisness for my wife, i wonder if she can put one of those simple-pay device's on it. we are waiting on our web hosting service on the 13th, i also need to know if i can program our new busisness numbers to the amazon fire, we will have a 800 number and a local number. so many details, questions, idea's, ummmmmm

Would love to buy this phone but not when locked in with AT&T.; If and when you are available to Verizon customers I suppose I have to stick with my Galaxy S3.
I would buy an Amazon Fire Phone in a New York minute if I didn't have to use AT&T.;  I am finally AT&T; free and I want to stay that way.  I have been using T-Mobile for 10 years and I am very happy with T-Mobile.  Apple made the same mistake when the iPhone was introduced.  AT&T; kept me from even considering an iPhone.
you had a chance but lost me at AT&T;,  a shame you have what appears to be a good phone and then proprietized it. Sorry you had tp copy Apple's distribution plan but even they opened up to all networks..hint, hint.  Call me when i can have a different carrier.

This phone has a lot of good feature that I don't need, gestures that I don't use, and it does the very same thing as my old $30 smart phone (of course Fire Phone does it faster). The price is ridiculously high.

Not interested in this smartphone. Especially it's "Cloud" component.
OK, I don't have this phone and won't although I'd love to but until I'm not locked to AT&T;, I won't touch it. I'm single and get more bang for my buck from Virgin Mobile without any long term commitment, a no brainer. Bad move Amazon.<br/>This from a dedicated Amazon lover. I've never posted a review without owning the product but am breaking my rule so Amazon will see this.
I am completely underwhelmed by Amazon’s first attempt at a smartphone. The Fire is certainly not cutting edge when its key feature, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, is powered by outdated, dirty forms of energy like coal and gas. If other tech companies like Apple and Google can commit to powering their data centers with 100% renewable energy — so can Amazon.

I can say how much it sucks that they only contracted it to the worst carrier out there... I had at&t; back when iPhone came out, I would have no reception. So I went to complain at the local store, the manager there told me: "Well on your contract you signed, if you read it you would know that at&t; doesn't guarantee service. Next time it happens though txt me the time and location and I will see what we can do." So when my phone is not working tell her... Well regardless of how dumb that was I did, for two months with out result. I went back in to complain to her and she just said well I'm sorry can't do anything. Doesn't fix that my phone had no service for hours with out knowing how my family needed me (note I had at the moment one special needs child). I paid to drop at&t; for two phone lines and ran to the next TMobile and paid whatever just to get something that works. So the idea of needing to get at&t; to get the fire phone... I would rather wait until they put it with a company that cares about their costumers and actually has service that works + with the reviews I'm see'ing of the phone it may be best to wait for their next upgrade of fire II or something.
until this phone is clean and green i think jeff and amazon are very mean.
Need to add additional carriers
Use renewable energy to power the cloud! Apple is using 100% renewable energy! I am against apple products but the fact that Amazon uses coal and gas to power the cloud is making me want to buy an iPhone instead. Please fix. If you do this Amazon will be superior. It will be costly at first, but you will save millions after converting.

Amazon can do much better. Competitors like Apple power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, and so can Amazon. Support your smart phone by using clean, renewable energy! Our global future is at stake and we have a choice.

You can buy the HTC One M8 for the same price as this unlocked, this phone doesn't offer any apps and is just a gimmick for the get-go.
Why the Fire is really a misfire. I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.

Bought the full price unlooked phone only to discover that it only work in ATT, very misleading I dont know if it was on purpose.... I am surprised a company like Amazon will be so slopy with the launching of such a big product....dropping the ball here.
Please use renewable energy to fuel up the cloud.
Amazon and its fire phone support dirty energy.
Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. I am upset that one of the Fire’s key features, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, comes with a hidden and harmful cost. Unlike Apple and Google who have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s data centers are powered by dirty energy like coal and gas.

Didn't Light My Fire ... I think it’s completely unnecessary that many of the Fire's key features, like unlimited cloud photo storage, are supported by Amazon's data centers that are powered by coal and other dirty energy. If Amazon matched competitors like Apple by powering their operations with clean and renewable energy, then maybe I could give a higher review.
I hear it's run on dirty non sustainable energy which would put me off buying it.
Amazon’s cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power.  Buy Apple instead.

Amazon advertises unlimited photo storage in the cloud for it's product 'Fire' but this comes with a hidden cost. The Fire's reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud is unacceptable - especially when competitors like Apple are using 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon can commit to using modern clean energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.  We need to support a GLOBAL effort to reduce our carbon - that includes Amazon.
I am disappointed that Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire, just isn't “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported with electricity produced by the ancient, polluting fossil fuels coal and gas. Why isn't Amazon committing to match competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud???  How backward can Jeff Bezos be?!
Limiting the phone to one technology and one carrier is a weakness that makes this phone a 2nd rate attempt to enter the cell phone business.  To be a serious entry in the wireless business, Amazon must offer this to  the subscribers of every US carrier regardless of size and technology.  AT&T; is not a quality carrier in many US markets.
The Fire could be MUCH better.I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.
Let me know what you all think and If AT&T; is worth it in the Colorado Springs-Pueblo Co area? This is a neat idea but I think what would be even better if it were with all cell carriers. If Amazon did this so you can choose any-all carriers would  definitely be the best way.
Cloud storage is run on dirty energy like gas, nuclear, and coal. Polluting our environment for something that is constantly running. One star from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy like solar and wind to power their cloud.
It’s time to put out the Fire! It makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud is not a strong selling point, especially when competitors like Apple are using 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon can commit to using modern energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.
Terrible phone.
Not a wise purchase AT ALL!

I do not have one of these FANTASTIC phones saw one the other day is amazing I want one but don't have the money right now, I do buy from Amazon a lot and will continue but maybe I can soon buy one of the greatest phones ever.

Amazon needs to use clean energy sources

Would really like to buy one of these but there is no way I would sign up for a phone on AT & T. Really do not like those guys, have had service in the past and its expensive and not good. Good start Amazon, but I'll come back when you have a better choice of carriers!
As long as dirty fuel is responsible for data storage at Amazon, unlike Apple's 100% renewable (now Apple just has to clean up their unethical profit margins and Chinese labor stigma), I'm giving Amazon a black eye.  It's time to come clean with the public and express their game plan for cleaning up their act.  The climate won't wait,  time is about out.
I would love to get this phone but AT&T; only is a deal breaker. If I could use it on Verizon I would get one this year.
Lousy.  Freaking lousy.
i have done hundreds of purchase on amazon and this one is probably the worst one.<br/>this item is very weird and i never use it in fact. not even connected it to AT&T.;<br/>can you refund me ?<br/>thank you<br/>olivier leclercq
I am completely underwhelmed by Amazon’s first attempt at a smartphone. The Fire is certainly not cutting edge when its key feature, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, is powered by outdated, dirty forms of energy like coal and gas. If other tech companies like Apple and Google can commit to powering their data centers with 100% renewable energy — so can Amazon.
Purchase this phone if you want to contribute to the continued decline of the stability of Earth's atmosphere. It is supported by Amazon's continued use of dirty energy like coal. The atmosphere we have is a very rare cosmic phenomenon and it should be treated that way, not cavalierly pilfered for profit, as those that are selling this phone are doing right now.
I can't support a product that is produced with so little concern for the environment.

Save your money
Ugh, it uses dirty energy to power the cloud. That's very 1990s of them.
"In addition to the environmental benefits inherently associated with running applications in the cloud, AWS has a long-term commitment to achieve 100% renewable energy usage for our global infrastructure footprint."<br/><br/>Wish you had done this earlier
Amazon should consider using renewable energy for its cloud service!
Lame, cannot install android apps, cannot install iOS apps. Can only install amazon apps. Only thing this phone has going for it is amazon prime, but you can get that without it, either get a droid or get an iPhone, don't go in between and get stuck with crap.

If this phone was on any network other than AT&T;, and had the Google Play store, I'd have bought it in a heartbeat.

Dont care about chasing after the next big extortion disguised as a smart phone.and spending all this time on these reviews like you were writing about an intimate experience.yeah smart phones are fun and usefull.but,dont let your personal sense of value ride on if u got the next big money trap.god when it all comes down too it.it is just a phone.snap out of it.god!i give my speech 5 stars.lol

I have not purchased this phone, but if Amazon is using "dirty energy" in its' cloud data centers....WHILE touting its' unlimited storage, that is ludicrous. I won't be purchasing this item. Amazon needs to use renewable energy like Apple, Google and Facebook. I am disappointed about Amazon's choice when environmental issues aren't of utmost consideration.

Not sure about this phone at this time.
Well, after reading several reviews, (most of which are negative), I choose to stay with my IPhone 5s.  My boyfriend has a 4 year old LG Alley from Verizon and certain functions keep breaking but he refuses to buy a new one or even upgrade until next October.  Like a lot of men, he is very stubborn and will be sorry when his phone breaks down altogether.  I have had the Droid Razor and a bunch of other non-contract cell phones but so far the best two phones out there today are the IPhone 5s and the Samsung Galaxy 5 which I just bought for my daughter when her old Samsung phone finally broke.  Cell phones are not made to last more than a few years (at most) so I choose to get the best cell phone I possibly can for both business and personal use!  I have read a lot about this new Amazon Fire Phone and thought about trying it out BUT number one, I hate AT&T; and number 2, I don't need an extra cell phone.  There are so many companies trying to saturate the market with new and different kinds of cell phones and just about everywhere we go and in most cities, there are mom and pop stores opening up a new cell phone store.  Way too much competition and the sad part is, if you get a contract, you end up with all kinds of charges that you don't understand and it takes forever to get customer service to do anything about it.  Just like cable TV service; what you want, you really cant get or afford.  No thanks Amazon!

Apple and google are committed to powering their data centers with 100 percent renewable energy.<br/><br/>Amazon uses outdated, dirty forms of energy like coal, gas and nuclear to power their data centers
Made for steaming..... AT&T; not good for streaming, over charge for Data use,, so this for is useless...
This phone is a huge energy drain, using an air-conditioned cloud for data storage, and fueling that by a mix of dirty fossil fuels. Check out Apple phones, instead, whose cloud is all solar-powered.
The so called free cloud service is powered with coal, oil and gas. "cloud" is itself very wasteful when SD cards and onboard storage can be used. You get all of that radiation, so I don't like this phone.

I don't own this, I'll flat out admit that right now.  I won't either; not so long as it's tied to AT&T.;<br/><br/>I won't do any business with AT&T; ever again if I can help it.
The Fire’s unlimited photo storage in the cloud, is supported by dirty energy like coal and gas. Amazon sould commit to powering their data centers with 100% clean, renewable energy like Apple and Google.

Being powered by dirty energy (cloud storage) as opposed to clean renewable energy by apple. wake up amazon, is anyone there?
""DISCLAIMER""  I DO NOT OWN THIS PHONE but....<br/>I am an Amazon Prime customer with a Kindle FireHD ( I DO LOVE IT!!)  currently and even with the 99.00 Prime bump,it seems way over priced on BOTH sides of the transaction.<br/>I'm very interested in purchasing the Fire. It seems like a great phone for an Amazon oriented person (tho like the Kindle, they are easy to root for Android apps) but it doesnt seem worth it overall. If you accept the 0 down plan, you pay the full 699.00 list price which is ridiculous! Even at the 199.00 price its difficult to justify the purchase at this point. As I'm sure Amazon has learned, the REAL issue comes with ATT.What a ripoff on service!  I started to fill out the screen up the point of seeing the offered ATT price plans. $60 for 300mb??? per MONTH??? NEVER!!<br/>When they lose the exclusive, and competition knocks that monthly price down to about 45.00 with unlimited T/T/D. I will buy one.<br/> ATT is the worst and biggest ripoff out there!! I'll be patient and wait for the price drops on both sides of this phone purchase.<br/>Until then sign me in as "VERY RELUCTANT CUSTOMER"
Not because the phone is so crap, but because Amazon is not being responsible to the environment.
I think most people are turned off by the commercial that make adults look like idiots! Yet another commercial that want you to think you are dumb and you should do what kids do...

I would consider buying the Fire if the i-cloud storage wasn't powered by dirty energy. Come on Amazon, you can do better.

Do not buy this
you all need to go the route of Apple and use power sources that are renewable, not powered by dirty energy<br/>with these new products Amazon should be investing in the planet's future, not just its bottom line
All I had to see was AT&T; and that was the end of that. As long as they are providing the "service" the phone will not be able to live up to its potential - simply put they are the WORST company to have any business with especially cellular services regardless of how great the phone is (and I'm sure its good). Good luck.
I thought I would throw my 2 cents in. ....great phone. My friend bought it and I got to play around with it. However, I think Amazon's issue is they are limiting their client base by only offering the fire phone to AT&T; customers. There are a lot better carriers (VERIZON &T-MOBILE;) out there with millions of customers. I really wanted this phone but I will not switch to AT&T; to get it. So when my phone comes up for an up grade next month, it's a new galaxy for me.

After reading everyone's review......I have decided NOT to purchase the Fire phone by Amazon.  Bummer !!!  After all....it is their first smartphone....so hopefully with time, it will improve.Otherwise, I LOVE AMAZON.com !!!
Great.
not environmentally sound. you need to change your energy source to save our planet. Come on Amazon, get on the heal the earth program!
Amazon prides itself on customer satisfaction, but I’m definitely not satisfied with the Fire. I can’t support a device that needlessly stores all my music, photos, and videos in data centers powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. If other tech giants like Apple and Google can commit to powering their data centers with clean, renewable energy - so can Amazon.

Boycott "Fire" products until they make them compatible with google apps. Amazon lacks the apps and those that are availble are usually not as good as the Android version.

Amazon could easily commit to powering their data centers with 100% clean, renewable energy like Apple and Google, but they don’t.

Not a smart buy.
Misfire! I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.
Dirty energy? No thanks!
I would love to be able to give this product an actual review but considering I cannot even purchase it due to the AT&T; service provider restriction I am forced to give it a 1 star. And to me that is rather unfortunate considering how much I love and support my other Fire products (Kindle and TV) and how often I use Amazon for my other purchases. One day when the Fire Phone is supported by other service providers I may come back here and be able to provide a real review but for now I am just a disgruntled customer that is scratching their head over such a restrictive move.
Because this phone is made using outdated, environmentally unsound fuels, I  certainly will not consider using it or endorsing it.  You can do better!  USE SAFE ENVIRONMENTALLY FUELS!
As part of the agreement with Google under the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), any manufactured devices running Android, or a variation of, are required to publicly release their source code. As of today, Amazon has not done so.<br/><br/>Until the source code is released, the Fire Phone is being illegally distributed.<br/><br/>Other than the source code issue (which I agree does not affect most customers, but what's right is right) the phone itself operates well. Dynamic Perspective and the "3D" display (which is only a lockscreen) is a gimmick and a joke.<br/><br/>Overall, there are much better devices for your money. (See HTC M8, Galaxy S5, Nexus 5)
I disapprove of your dirty energy
I am upset that one of the Fire’s key features, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, comes with a hidden and harmful cost. Unlike Apple and Google who have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s data centers are powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary.
Who would actually buy this silly flop of a phone with useless gimmick and hobbled 'android' app store. Especially on a two year contract. If you buy just for the shopping then you need to reexamine you mental health.
The Fire could be MUCH better.I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.
It is absolutely appalling that Fire’s key features, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, comes with a DISASTEROUS cost. Unlike Apple and Google who have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s data centers are powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. This environmentally dirty policy is UNACCEPTABLE!!!
Didn't Light My Fire ... I think it’s completely unnecessary that many of the Fire's key features, like unlimited cloud photo storage, are supported by Amazon's data centers that are powered by coal and other dirty energy. If Amazon matched competitors like Apple by powering their operations with clean and renewable energy, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.
One star because I am so disappointed in Amazon for using dirty energy sources for the popular photo download feature.  Apple and others use renewable energy sources.  I travelled and marched with 400,000 passionate climate protesters in NYC last week.  Americans are figuring this out.  So change your energy source, if you want us to consider buying and fairly rating this phone.
I played with one of these phones that a friend has and wow.... It's like a feature phone from the 90's. Being sold based on a gimmick that doesn't work (the faux 3D screen), the phone's best feature, Firefly, hardly works and should be a standalone app. This phone is a huge misstep for Amazon, and I think they know it.

Environmentally poisonous --coal powered.  Very disappointed.
Unless you are hard core into Prime,  this phone is a joke. Overpriced, locked to AT&T;,  locked out of the  PlayStore.  Ther are far better phones with more capabilites and at much lower cost.

It’s time to put out the Fire! It makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud is not a strong selling point, especially when competitors like Apple are using 100% clean, renewable energy.

This phone runs on dirty energy.
Green cloud storage would make it acceptable.
Amazon’s cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power.

It seems they aren't willing to sacrifice a few pennies to protect our world. Greed at it's worst. I will be boycotting them until they do. I hope those who read this will too.

I think it is overpriced.  I was quite interested when the news that it was to be released.  I was expecting something in the $100 range.  Disappointed.

Get on the energy conservation and world preservation bandwagon!!!!

I knew that it will be a terrible phone.  I like Amazon in general but now they have started to squeeze their loyal customers and now this gimmicky and terrible phone to lure and fool their customers more.  I checked this phone from a friend who recently bought it and was embarrassed several time when he tried to show it off.  I feel sorry for the guy, needless to say in 3 days he returned it.  Amazon pls. stop making phones and focus on your core business and beware of competitors who are rapidly closing up on your lead.

This phone support coal energy.  The "cloud" on which your information is stored is not solar or wind powered; it is powered with dirty energy.  I was very disappointed to find this.  Do not purchase unless you do not wish to keep our planet livable.
I would not buy this.

Only through the AT&T; network. No thanks.
If Amazon wants to make a phone it should be in the budget phone market. However I would still want the 3 times cheaper Moto G over this crap.<br/><br/>It's a shame Amazon makes you give at least one star.<br/><br/>Use your money wisely and buy a nexus.<br/><br/>Bottom line is there's much better things to buy for much less money.
Uses dirty energy to power icloud
While I don't own this phone, I wouldn't want to since all Amazon devices rely so heavily on AWS, their cloud, which comes with a hidden and harmful cost. Unlike Apple and Google who have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, Amazon's data centers are powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. The Fire's reliance on dirty energy isn't cutting edge, and it's completely unnecessary.
This product is extremely overpriced for what it does. This doesn't have access to any of Google's services that make an Android phone awesome. Why would somebody spend their hard earned money on this?

I don't own this but, $649!?!?!?!? I hope it wipes your arse for you for that amount.plus the app store is  crap. When can we have a real alternative to iPhone and Android?

Amazon prides itself on customer satisfaction, but I’m definitely not satisfied with the Fire. I can’t support a device that needlessly stores all my music, photos, and videos in data centers powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. If other tech giants like Apple and Google can commit to powering their data centers with clean, renewable energy - so can Amazon.
Didn't Light My Fire ... I think it’s completely unnecessary that many of the Fire's key features, like unlimited cloud photo storage, are supported by Amazon's data centers that are powered by coal and other dirty energy. If Amazon matched competitors like Apple by powering their operations with clean and renewable energy, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.
With all of the technology available and the research platforms to draw from, the Fire should be far more environmentally friendly.  There is absolutely no reason, other than Amazon's revenue focus, to produce a phone that compromises valuable natural resources instead of being efficient.
Too conclusive  too many avvertisement
bad environmental energy power supplies the amazon fire phone cloud: dirty coal. if amazon switched  to renewable energy sources (and they can) they could have a winner in their hands: until then, both thumbs down. shame on amazon.
please end your current ad campaign featuring the two horrible hipster douche bags kids.  I change the channel as soon as I see them, and I could not possible purchase a product shilled by two horrible narcissists in training.
I understand your cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power.  Clean energy performance and safe environmental impact are a must.  Make your phones become supported by clean, renewable energy.
Good job amazon- only offering it to AT&T; subscribers, a real slap in the face to a loyal Prime subscriber who would never do business with a company like AT&T.; Don't expect me to renew my prime acct. next year.
environmentally horrible!
boo
Please use clean energy to make you products don't pollute the planet God can't be happy if we do
This phone is not produced in an ecologically responsible manner, like the iPhone. So I won't even look at it or consider it.

I'm not interested in doing business with a company with absolutely no ethics at all.
Amazon needs to fix it's energy policies
I have reconsidered my decision to purchase the Amazon Fire Phone due to the following reason: The Fire is certainly not cutting edge when its key feature, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, is powered by outdated, dirty forms of energy like coal and gas. If other tech companies like Apple and Google can commit to powering their data centers with 100% renewable energy — so can Amazon. In summary: My decision to buy the Fire Phone is on ice until Amazon can commit to power its data center with 100% renewable energy!
Can Amazon monopolize anything else?  Fortunately, I don't see a huge demand for these phones given that the market is fairly saturated.  The major decision in most new smartphone purchases is iPhone or Android?  And the Fire is not ranked in the top 10...unless your primary requirement is to stream TV/movies very well!  I simply think Amazon should stick to its strengths!!!  Kindles are great, but Amazon's foray into phones was a mistake.
Hi tech needs to be powered by something other than coal fired steam propelled generated electricity.  Make a commitment to go solar and wind to power the cloud.

Stay away from it until it is offered by a carrier other than AT&T;
Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. I am upset that one of the Fire’s key features, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, comes with a hidden and harmful cost. Unlike Apple and Google who have committed to powering their operations with 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s data centers are powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary.
Does not use clean energy

Too bad it is only available on AT&T---their; service is terrible in my area----totally unfair for users of other service providers
Stop trying to be everything to everybody and focus on one what your good at.  Those tv ads for the fire phone certainly didn't help sell any  any did they?  Have you built this phone for kids?
I wish I could have gone lower. This phone has caused my family 100-200$ the operating system takes up gigabytes and it charges you for it 15$ per gigabyte
Bloated Android, the phone is another tool mainly to advertise for Amazon. To each his own, this is just yet  another Android phone, nothing spectacular.<br/><br/>P.S.: A user "Just wondering" apparently has a bit too much time on his hand to lurk through Amazon reviews and go against those who do not like the phone. He must love his Amazon phone, lol.
Might be the best phone ever made, but I couldn't buy it and feel good about myself or the product.  In a time when the entire population of the world is facing one of the most dangerous problems we have faced in our time, I cannot buy a product from a company that is not doing its best to help correct the problem of global warming.  At a time when other major corporations are converting or have already converted to safe, non polluting, renewable energy sources, Amazon has continued to use dirty, polluting, non-renewable energy sources such as coal, oil and natural gas.  Until Amazon shows that it is willing to help the world and it's people, I cannot give a rating of more than 1 star for any Amazon product.
The Fire could be MUCH better.I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.

It's  powered by dirty energy:  nuclear, coal, gas/oil.
Why the Fire is really a misfire. I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.
I have always been an amazon buyer and prime member but where I live there is no AT&T; service so I could not even try this product.
It must be named "Fire" after the fossil fuels Amazon burns to power the cloud. Amazon, take a page from Apple and Google, and commit to running your data centers with 100% clean, renewable energy.
Powdered by dirty energy.
i am a avid and long time user of the kindle and considered switching from my smasung "phablet" to the kindle fire, but no way until the cloud is supported by 100% - that's 100% - clean energy, the more renewable the better. . . no "clean coal", no gas from fracking. . .<br/><br/>GET WITH IT!
Too heavy and<br/>not compatible with my car

I would certainly love to have this phone but not with AT& T. I had very bad experience with their service and dropped calls and would rather wait till T Mobile or sprint start offering the phone.
It is a cheap piece of plastic.  Don't waste your money... I should have kept my iPhone.  :(
Cloud storage should be run with 100% renewable energy. This device does not meet this criteria, not even close, it is therefore going to contribute to massive increases in global warming and pollution through the burning of fossil fuels.<br/>For the sake of our planet and our children I would not recommend this gadget!

Don't know how good the phone is but it doesn't matter. The Fire could be the greatest phone ever and it would still would not be worth having to use ATT for a service provider! I'd rather not have a phone at all than have to use ATT. How bone head is this this - it ranks right up there with Costco only accepting AMEX, which is universally regarded as the worst credit card company.
supports dirty energy.
Didn't Light My Fire ...

Amazon needs to power it's cloud storage server farms with clean, renewable energy.
Never buy a compter with the same name as the srore you bought it from. Works jusr as well for smart phones.

Amazon’s cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power. Shame. Unlike Apple’s iCloud which is powered by 100% renewable energy.  Go green, go Apple.
Definitely disturbing... can we start a list here of which (significant!) apps we've found so far do not work with the Fire Phone?
Fire phone? Who the heck makes this? Dont matter. AT&T; sucks.
A phone whose cloud is powered with coal, nuclear power. No thanks! Power  the phone's cloud with renewable energy and I'll change my  Rating.

Their Cloud service is NOT Environmentally Friendly!
Uses dirty energy (nuke, coal, etc.) for cloud storage.  Clean up your act, Amazon.
I have investigated your FIRE cellphone - but have decided on a Google androit instead: Amazon uses dirty energy for their cloud storage - Google does not! I am an Amazon customer but feel strongly: It is time to clean up your act, Amazon!

Didn't test it yet but from what I read so far I definitly want to give it a try
The cloud servers that store all of your pictures, music and messages run on dirty energy, generated from the burning of coal and gas, and nuclear power.

Even though this sounds like a great deal, I am unable to receive AT&T; where I live, so the purchase is moot. If it was usable on other cellular carriers, I would most likely get it if the price wasn't to high.
I chose not to purchase this phone. I went into the AT&T; store and tested it out. I tried out some basic apps and when it couldn't load the built in maps app I put it down and walked away. I was hoping for something impressive. On the upside the games built for it look promising.
Well, this is rather awkward: the Amazon Fire Phone has rung in with fossil fuels set aflame. Amazon, do justice for the forests you're named after and make the planet-worthy transition to renewable green energy to cover your services.
holy crap look at that price! crazy
This phone is geared to amazon fanatic and and leaves no room for anybody nobody else.
Unlike Yahoo and Google, your data storage uses dirty energy

unlimited cloud data storage ... but there’s a BIG catch - unlike Apple’s iCloud which is powered by 100% renewable energy, Amazon’s cloud data centers are run on dirty energy like coal, gas and nuclear power. Nuclear!
There is only one thing to say here. Amazon has to be very stupid, or they really have balls to put this phone at the same level as an iPhone. C'mon people, the only way you can like this is if you come from a 1990 mobile device, and even like that, you get an IPHONE for the same price!!! Seriously Amazon?<br/><br/>There is no comparison between this an ANY smartphone out there. None whatsoever. Everything about it is SO wrong. Not an intuitive system. Almost no apps, and the ones they have don't work good. Most of the time the "back" button gets lost. The Dynamic Perspective looks childish, cheap. So Basic. Seriously. I feel compeled to write this review because its unbelievable how can a company thinks this phone can go against an iPhone or an Android.
I am a Prime member and won't consider this phone because ATT service is horrible. We live in Denver and all our ATT phones continually dropped our signals. When I complained, I was told that they were building towers. I pay for service in the present, not future. After using ATT for years, we went to Verizon and have had no problems with poor quality connections or dropped calls. Even now when I try to talk to my sister who lives outside of DC I still have trouble understanding her as the service ebbs and flows...she is an ATT customer!! I will never go back to ATT!

I wouldn't even try this phone as it's an AT&T; exclusive! AT&T; is the worst company I have ever dealt with and their service sucks anyway! Whereas T-Mobile has been the best I have ever dealt with, but even they are trying my patience these days. Still, I will never have a phone that is with AT&T;! Keep trying. Amazon has almost taken over the world anyway, so they should have their own phone company as well!

Sorry, It gets one star just because its exclusive to ATT. Sorry amazon, there is 2 GSM carriers, not one. Will try out ONCE its on tmobile. Thats why this phones going to become like the facebook phone. Failure.
I was intrigued by this phone until I seen it uses AT&T; as a carrier. I'd stop using a cell phone before dealing with that worthless company. EVERYONE I know hates AT&T;, at least here in Iowa. Sketchy reception; lousy customer service; random overcharges,... that's what you'll get with AT&T.;<br/>Couldn't give it to me for free.

Too expensive
Wow soooo many negative feedback.
It’s time to put out the Fire! It makes sense why the price of the Fire has dropped to 99 cents, when its key feature - unlimited photo storage in the cloud - comes with a hidden cost. The Fire’s reliance on dirty energy like coal and gas to power its cloud is not a strong selling point, especially when competitors like Apple are using 100% clean, renewable energy. If Amazon can commit to using modern energy sources, then maybe I could consider giving the Fire a higher review.
Amazon prides itself on customer satisfaction, but I’m definitely not satisfied with the Fire. I can’t support a device that needlessly stores all my music, photos, and videos in data centers powered by dirty energy like coal and gas. If other tech giants like Apple and Google can commit to powering their data centers with clean, renewable energy - so can Amazon.
I would walk on water to get this phone ...BUT I HATE AT&T;!!!!!!!
I don't want to use a product that is so clearly run on dirty fuels and hurt the environment. I support companies that strive to stay away from fossil fuels and run on clean ones instead.The Fire Phone does not fit the latter category at all.
Almost bought two of these phones, one for my wife and one for me but after reading the reviews.....no way.<br/>we looked at reviews from many different sources and found that these phones overheat and have poor battery life, few compatible apps and can only be used on the ATT network.......Amazon is getting worse every year, first with raising the prime membership and now with this poorly designed phone......glad we did'nt make the purchase, because it would have been shipped back like so many others are doing with them now.......Amazon...what is going on over there?
No one buy this phone why cause AT&T; is the worst service ever for it it would have been better with Verizon then again you can't fix stupid seriously and the over $600 price it's outrageous for something that seemed to have so much promise its just sad very disappointed with it!
Unlimited cloud storage is great, unless it's 100% powered by dirty energy. Other big tech companies are using green energy to power their cloud servers and it's time for Amazon to follow suit.
test
First off, I did not buy this phone, I really wanted one and I love amazon and I was even willing to go with at&t; (not my 1st choice in carriers), but 101 1-star reviews (at the date of this review) and the contents of those reviews changed my mind.  I have to say that I am very disappointed since I love my Kindle fire and was really looking forward to getting this phone. (i actually bought 2 kindles, 1 was to replace my sisters ipad, kindle is MUCH better).  I'm hoping this review will help spur amazon to do better with the next Fire phone, I still want one, but as it stands now, this phone is off my list.  Sorry Amazon but the percentage of negative reviews is just too high.
I didn't purchase because I cannot use my phone proveder. I really would like one, though.
I don't appreciate your rewarding my  loyalty as a customer by forcing this ad to me.
Unfortunately I cannot support a product made by Amazon, as their facilities are powered by dirty energy like coal, oil, and natural gas. If other tech giants like Apple and Google can commit to powering their data centers with clean, renewable energy - so can Amazon.
As someone who cares about the environment, it’s discouraging that one of the Fire’s key features, its photo storage, is powered by polluting forms of energy. When I take pictures with the Fire, I want to know they’re being powered by renewable energy (which is true for Apple’s iCloud, for example), not creating pollution. If Amazon powered its operations with clean energy, I could consider giving it a higher review.
Amazon prides itself on customer satisfaction, but I’m definitely not satisfied with the Fire.

I am completely underwhelmed by Amazon’s first attempt at a smartphone. The Fire is certainly not cutting edge when its key feature, unlimited photo storage in the cloud, is powered by outdated, dirty forms of energy like coal and gas. If other tech companies like Apple and Google can commit to powering their data centers with 100% renewable energy — so can Amazon.

Why the Fire is really a misfire. I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.

I Am Sory I Every Bought This Phone. ATT costomer Services SUCKS S*** .  The Phone Bearly Works At All .And I Can Not Get Any Help!!!!!!!!!~<br/>Update 5-20-2015--FIRE Phone Is Right!!! Mine Just Set Fire To My Desk!!!
The Fire could be MUCH better.I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.
Disappointing to learn that the Fire's unlimited photo storage capability is supported by dirty coal and gas energy.  Amazon must commit to powering with clean, renewable energy the same as Apple and Google.  Amazon must commit to better environmental habits.
This is a phone ida gladly paid full price for except its not available on verizon where I cound take advantage of my other unlimited data number .<br/>Also this phone should be at least the same size as the note 3 considering all the video aatching ida been doing on it .
The phone has no qualities it sucks and omg is it heavy

Amazon’s Fire’s reliance on dirty energy isn’t cutting edge, and it’s completely unnecessary. Storing our photos, music and messages shouldn’t mean we are forced to damage the health of our climate and communities. Apple, Facebook, and Google have figured out how to store our photos and music with renewable energy, and so can Amazon.  It’s time to move to modern energy sources and make a “smarter phone” supported by clean, renewable energy.

The commercial is so horrible.  This is the best you can do Amazon?

Worst choice for the environment! Couldn't justify this purchase when I found out how it is produced!
Your cloud system is fueled by dirty coal!
Wow this phone is so uggos and useless it makes me so sad.
this phone sucks don't buy it!!!!
Amazon should power your cloud with clean renewable energy like your competitors. Shame on you.
It only works on Dirty Energy.

Please consider using renewable energy, instead of the 'dirty' energy that you are using to manufacture this product.
Bezos its time to make this phone $10 and get it off the Amazon site.
No good
I would like to be able to give it 5 stars but I can only base my review on reports and wishes. You see Amazon won't allow me to have one of the phones,I don't have AT&T; so I can't have one of the phones. OH well guess my galaxy will do just fine.
This is a copy of wiko rainbow:-)<br/>Why don't pick up this?<br/>5 star:-)

I was seriously considering purchasing this phone, mainly because of the amount of cloud storage available, until I did some research and realized that Amazon unilaterally uses coal and gas to power their data centers. HELLO, WE AREN'T IN 1985 ANYMORE! Get with the modern age, Amazon!!!<br/>Until Amazon uses renewable energy, I'll stick with my iphone. At least with Apple I know I'm not destroying our planet my by storing my photos.

First off. If everybody knew what a "paragraph" was, reviews might be better. 3-4 sentences max.  Try seperating them!<br/><br/>Sounds like rubbish. Some unique ideas. But failure again for Amazon.

Phone specs, os, haredware is clean as a diamond but origins of power source used for data centers is dirty as coal. Shame on amazon for using non renewable powered server farms for Fire OS power systems. When this changes I will buy one.

What a crying shame that Amazon isn't using renewable energy to power their cloud storage. S-o-o-o last century, and s-o-o-o-o unforgivable that this is a totally forgettable non essential product!
Was very excited about this phone. I use amazon all the time and I always give my honest and most truthful reviews, and I had too come on here. This phone is called fire for a reason. While using it one day I noticed smelling something. Looking down my hands were on fire but it was cool! I had super powers!! My amazon phone helped me cook, camp, and light a fire in style for my lady....thank you amazon phone!!! About 3 days in I noticed my hands were gone though so be careful.

Amazon, your methods of production (aka dirty, non-renewable energy) need to change. As a global company you need to focus/promote renewable sources that are sustainable. Not doing so is irresponsible, and in the end detrimental to you own company and the planet. Global warming is the most pressing issue of our time and you need to do your part to help, rather than make a cheaper phone by using fossil fuels

go buy it! #now
Powered by coal and gas.
It is not worth the money. I don't have this phone but I already know from specs and various other sources that battery life is a joke and the dynamic perspective they talk so much about is just a gimmick and major battery killer. Just don't buy this phone

Cut the dirty energy, Amazon! Let's get a greener future together :)
The fact that this device uses dirty energy to support it's cloud is unacceptable in this day and age.
I've been on this earth for 9 years and haven't seen anything like it
I can’t support a phone powered by dirty energy like coal and gas
Why support Amazon's products.  They basically flunked the Electronic Frontier Foundations "Who Has Your Back?" report in regard to protecting consumer privacy.
I bought the wife a kindle fire once. Huge mistake. Complicated, buggy, and not compatible with anything. Period. The thing just isn't worth using.<br/><br/>Why would I waste my money on this phone when Amazon has a history of selling complete junk at prices you'd pay for a quality product?<br/><br/>Just not interested in your little phone. I love buying things through amazon.com but you guys still haven't realized that slapping your name on cheap, imported junk just makes you look amateurish.<br/><br/>Apple has by far dominated the smart phone market and will continue to do so for some time. I just got a galaxy s4 and used it for a month before I traded it for an iPhone 5s. You couldn't pay me to use anything else.
Iphone is 100% better don't waste your money on this when you can have a high quality TRUSTED phone I know it's a new phone but ya know why not get a phone that WILL do everything you want

Terrible
It's not Apple. So who cares. Apple can sell us horse s*** and eventually we'll like it. Know why? Because it's Apple. Stop fighting world...Throw a half bitten apple on that phone and I'll buy it otherwise it's just horse s***, and not Apple horse s*** but JUST horse s***. Par exemple! Apple is selling a watch that tells your heartbeat. Really? Horse s***! But its Apple's Horse s***. So who caresssssss!
Amazon should utilize more renewable energy to power its data centers. Until they do so, I won't be buying devices created by Amazon.
I would be interested in this product, but it's hard for me to support companies who do not take their carbon footprint and environmental impact seriously. As cool as this phone may be, it's more important to me to to either not buy a new phone at all or buy a new one from a competitor with better environmental practices. Be a responsible company and make the switch to renewable energy sources.
LOL. This phone. rOFL. LMAO. This phone. 649. lol. This price. Rofl.
I like the IDEA of this phone. But I cannot support a company who won't green up it's cloud. Amazon! Keep being a company I can love by going 100% renewable please!

Stop using dirty energy like coal, Amazon!
Amazon is one of the world's largest and most advanced retailers, using drones for delivery, but they are still relying on the same fossil fuels that Henry Ford used at the turn of the last century!  I expected more from you Amazon.
Would love it if Amazon can live up to its name and move toward green energy
Misfire! I am very disappointed that as Amazon’s first ever smartphone, the Fire really isn’t that “smart.” Its key feature - unlimited cloud photo storage - is supported by ancient, polluting forms of electricity like coal and gas. “One Star” from me until Amazon can commit to matching competitors like Apple in using clean and renewable energy to power their cloud.
The Fire could be MUCH better.I’m giving the Fire a 1-star review because I believe that Amazon can do much better when providing a service like unlimited photo storage. If competitors like Apple can power their cloud with 100% renewable energy, so can Amazon. Make a “smarter” phone supported by clean, renewable energy! I shouldn't have to chose between the health of our climate and communities and storing my photos, music and messages.
Clean up your atv amazon ! Y'all are dirty and your destroying our planet.
i was highly disappointed to hear that amazon's data centers are powered completely on dirty, polluting energy like gas and coal. apple and google have stepped up to use renewable energies. hopefully amazon will step up it's game to a cleaner, healthy alternative.
Shape up, I refuse to use a phone that uses dirty energy. Go sustainable amazon and I will be back to using your services.
To Amazon:<br/>Please use cleaner energy<br/>Thanks,<br/>Greenpeace
Make Amazon go green!!<br/><br/>Amazon was rated a "D" for energy efficiency because they rely heavily on nuclear and coal energy. They have no consideration for the growing electricity footprints they are leave that affects general health and the environment. Give the fire phone a 1 star rating so we can make Amazon go green!
This phone is nasty because it uses dirty energy
No more dirty energy please
I can't support a phone powered by dirty energy like coal and gas."
