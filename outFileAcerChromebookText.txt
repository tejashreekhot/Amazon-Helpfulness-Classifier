I usually don't write reviews yet I feel this deserves my time to write one. I was really excited to buy a chromebook after I spent a good amount of time researching them and watching other reviews on youtube, (something I like to do before I buy something). Just to give a very quick overview of what a chromebook is, which is easy to make simple: They are very light-weight laptops, running off a solid state drive (usually aruond 16gig or 32gig). Chrome OS is the light environment, which I fell in love with. No more of all the crap widows tries to sell. No more viruses, AND you can run Ubuntu or other light Linux dsitros along side Chrome OS with a simple key command to change. It is extremely easy and quick to install Linux, just by searching a tutorial on Youtube it took less than an hour. With Ubuntu running offline I can have access to LibreOffice Writer and all the amazing free applications Linux offers. Okay enough about Linux because I could brag about how much I love that too forever. I just want to add in that I absolutely love the direction Google is going with Chrome OS and how it is presented in the Chromebooks. I am very impressed. For the money spent, these are very well built machines inside and out.<br/>A lot of people reviewed the c720 as feeling a little cheap and I can’t say that about the cb3-111. I was looking at a C720 tonight at the store and it did feel somewhat cheaper feeling compared to this one. The keyboard just feels very nice to type with, has a  nice subtle sound and the whole over feel of the acer in my lap is a wonderful experience. I really think this is the best technology device that I’ve ever bought for the price it is. I do everything on this thing!, (given that I am not a software writer or programer) Everytime I go on the google appstore I find something new that amazes me that I wouldn’t ever imagine I could do with it.<br/>This particular model has only 2 gigs ram, and only 16 gig solid state drive, with expandable sd card reader. I would have liked to have a little more solid state space. I’ve come to accept the low space and gigs of ram. The processor is very good, (the new intel dual i3) which is what I think makes it do what it can do.<br/>PROS: FAST!, Light weight, long battery, (over 8 hours), Nice feeling keyboard and trackpad, Anti-glare screen, and I think it just looks very good and stylish.<br/>CONS: I can’t think of any cons except that you can’t store much on the only 16gig ssd.<br/>FYI: Do not touch the screen, it is a nightmare for fingerprints. Keep clean with special cleaning cloths. Thats it….<br/><br/>Over all it is a really great experience to type on. I wish I had this in high-school. Very nice for research. Comfy to set in lap. Very fun to explore with. I will be buying another one when they come out with the bigger better series. AND I will def be checking out what else Acer has to offer. They are really showing innovation that is impressive.
My macbook pro died this Monday while I was writing an essay. I immediately headed to Best buy to get a Chromebook, thinking that if I got the macbook to work again, I'd just return the Chromebook and keep the 100gb of Google drive.<br/><br/>I'm actually loving this little laptop. It's very solid feeling and looks pretty nice without trying to be a macbook air. The screen is admittedly not the best in terms of viewing angles but for some people I know that's actually a feature.<br/><br/> The fact that it's matte makes it amazing though. I don't think I could go back to a glossy screen.<br/><br/>I installed Linux on it easily enough and thus can swap to a more powerful OS whenever I want to play games for instance ( got hearthstone installed and working well)<br/><br/>The best thing about this laptop though is that it's an absolute battery champion. Today it's lasted me through a 3h class during which I downloaded about 2gb worth of tv shows. After that I hopped on a bus to go to Massachusetts which got into an accident that delayed us 3h. Rolled up into Connecticut for my connection with 30% battery left having watched 2 movies, played a couple of games of hearthstone and browsed for the remainder of the 6 hour bus ride from hell.<br/><br/>I can not recommend this enough. Can't imagine anything being a better value for money. It's managed to not make me miss my 2000$ macbook!
Short Version:<br/>If you're not familiar with the sorts of things ChromeOS can and can't do, you should look into that before buying anything. If you search Google for things like what is a chromebook and ChromeOS limitations, you'll run into some nice articles that go over it.<br/><br/>My feeling is that ChromeOS is designed to do a limited set of things, but it does them well. It allows me to get certain parts of my work done more easily, using a device that has a REALLY long battery life and is small and very light. I love the fact that I can easily grab a Chromebook and move to work in another location when my dog wants to cuddle or I'm overseeing a kid working on a homework assignment, and I don't have to worry about whether the battery will hold up or whatever.<br/><br/>The key thing is making sure that you have a clear idea of what you want to do and whether ChromeOS can do that. If you want to install Steam games or play Minecraft, this is NOT the laptop for you (unless you're comfortable with installing Linux on it, which doesn't apply to the average person). If you want to interact with websites, write blog posts, and take online classes, these are really great to have.<br/><br/>Long version (including comparisons to the C720 Acer released last year):<br/>The size and basic hardware of this Chromebook are pretty much in line with the other options out there that are in a similar price range. If you were to actually look closely at the specs and compare them to what you'd typically find in an OS X or Windows laptop, they'll seem pretty weak. It works out really well, though, because ChromeOS is designed to be a limited operating system that's mostly used to access the web, doing things like visiting websites and watching videos. Since it doesn't have to do things like complicated video editing tasks that someone might want to do on a desktop, it doesn't need high end hardware to get the job done.<br/><br/>The benefit that comes with the hardware that they did choose is that it doesn't require very much power to run. I charged this thing up and then carried it around the house with me doing all of my normal computer tasks (I spend a lot of time online taking classes and doing my professional work) and you can use it for hours, glance at the battery indicator, and feel like you've hardly put a dent in it. The company claims 8.5 hours on a charge, and I think I might've actually been able to go longer than that if I'd really wanted to push it.<br/><br/>I have also used the C720 from the same company (which is one of the more popular Chromebooks out there) and performance-wise the two are honestly pretty similar. I can open a dozen tabs easily on 2GB of RAM without feeling like I'm giving the device trouble or having it slow down on me.<br/><br/>It feels like they boosted the build quality a little going from the C720 to this CB3. The keyboard feels a little nicer under my hands. I still don't love the way their trackpads feel when you actually press them down for a click, but they also accept a quick tap as a click and that feels fine. (I think they assumed most people would tap, so making the track pad click feel perfect may not have been a huge priority.)<br/><br/>The CB3 is also very slightly wider than the C720. It seems to be because they made the bezel a little thicker around the screen. It's also available in white, and I don't think the C720 ever was, so if you hate grey/black laptops, that's a nice bit of variety. The size/shape difference is subtle, and you should still be able to fit it into things like sleeves made for 11" laptops. (The C720 got a lot of 3rd party support for accessories and decals and cases specifically for it, but I don't know if that'll happen for this edition as well.)<br/><br/>They also moved the power and HDMI ports to the back, instead of the side.<br/><br/>For the most part, honestly, I've had the chance to try a few different Chromebooks and the performance doesn't generally vary much if you're just looking to do things like visit social media sites, read the news, watch Netflix, write documents, and that sort of thing. They all use the same ChromeOS, so they all have the same basic features as far as what it's possible to do. If you're using sites with a lot of complicated scripting or something like that, you should worry a little more about the specs, but for the average person just about any Chromebook that's out there is going to do a good job performance-wise.<br/><br/>If you're planning to make it run a more standard form of Linux instead of using only ChromeOS, though, you will want to at least make sure you pay attention to what processor you're getting. There are some pieces of software for Linux that aren't available at all for non-Intel architectures. If you're planning to run something like Ubuntu on your Chromebook, then, it's probably worth going for an Intel Chromebook (and this is one). This only applies to a small sliver of the overall shopping population, though, so don't worry about it if this whole paragraph made no sense to you.<br/><br/>The price/performance ratio you get with Chromebooks is fantastic. I have Windows and Linux going on desktop computers that are much more powerful on paper, and I still spend a fair part of my day using ChromeOS. I even find myself sometimes grabbing a Chromebook to do something even if I'm physically at the desk where the more powerful computers are set up. It's nice to have this environment that's somewhat locked down (you mostly can't install software programs, for example) because that reduces security issues.<br/><br/>ChromeOS does a limited number of things, but it does them very well. If you rely heavily on the Internet to do things that are important to you, this device is well worth what they're charging for it.
I was on the fence on buying a Chromebook, but I needed a decent cheap laptop for college that was good for typing and lightweight to carry around. I didn't want to take a $1000+ Apple to school, and I like Google products, so I bought the CB3-111 model and I love it. For $200, it's perfect for class because of it's compact 11 inch screen and the weight is very light. I read reviews that drawbacks to the Chromebook is that it completely operates on the Chrome OS (a customized Google version of Linux), which means it can only be used on wi-fi. This is not the case. Google has plenty of offline apps as well as a full stock of 3rd party apps in their Chrome Web store. Importantly, Google Docs (which is Google's document software similar to Windows Word or Apple's Pages) can be used offline, you have to sync it to the computer to become offline operable  (takes under a minute to do). You can also download music, word documents, pdfs, etc, and for torrent fans, JSTorrent is a great app to download torrent files, but don't do anything illegal!<br/><br/>The cloud based system is also good. While you can still download files, it's good to run everything through the cloud. You can access it anywhere, like Library computers, or your computer at home. The 100gb Google Drive space is also a nice bonus, since I was able to put tons of files in it. I downloaded a few files, but overall, I'm now using all cloud based apps.<br/><br/>Acer to Chromebook users, including myself, seems to be the leading Chromebook makers. I can see why, it's powerful in a budget. First, if you're going to buy any Chromebook, make sure to get a Intel chip. Chromebooks, like many Samsung or HP CB, have ARM-based chips (Samsung brand) - ARM chips will SIGNIFICANTLY limit your Chromebook. This CB3 model has a Intel Celeron Chip, Bay Trail model. While Bay Trail, in my opinion, is better suited for Chromebooks, if you're looking for speed, this chip is slightly slower than the Celeron 2995U chip, but honestly, I don't notice the difference. Chromebooks aren't built to be heavy machines to be using Photoshop or video games. It's fast and I never had it lag on me.<br/><br/>I've had this Chromebook for a month and I have no regrets purchasing this. Just be aware, the only drawback to ANY Chromebook is if you're going to print anything, make sure to have a Google Ready Printer, because it does NOT support USB printers (since it doesn't run printer drives). Google states they are working on it, but I don't see it being a major installment in the near future, so make sure you have a supporting printer.<br/><br/>For College students, this is a great device and Chromebooks are awesome and convenient. For the price, it's definitely worth the investment.
I originally bought this chromebook as a secondary device that was lightweight and easy to take back and forth to school.  It fulfills that extremely well, and also has surprised me in some aspects that make this device much more impressive. Anyone concerned about productivity on this device has some valid concerns, but I'll explain how to alleviate almost everything. I'll also try to compare this as much as possible to the Acer c720, since some people seemed to be torn between both of them as they both have similar specs and price points.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Lightweight<br/>-Low Powered, Fast CPU<br/>-Long Battery Life<br/>-Solid State Hard Drive<br/>-Great Build Quality<br/>-Good App selection<br/>-Versatility and Portability<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-No traditional computer programs available<br/>-Not a traditional OS<br/>-Only wireless printing available<br/>-Will not be able to play 3D games, such as minecraft (even on Ubuntu)<br/><br/>Here's a dissected review on points I think are important.<br/><br/>BUILD QUALITY<br/>The build quality is very good for a cheap computer.  The laptop feels very well put together.  The keyboard has a good "snap" to it and has really good resistance, doesn't feel cheap at all.  The trackpad is nice and big, and doesn't interfere at all while typing.  It isn't nearly as good as the touchpad on a Macbook for instance, but it certainly doesn't disappoint.  The white color definitely adds a sense of style that the Acer c720 doesn't have.  It's also thinner than the c720 and weighs less.  It's a very sturdy, well put together device.<br/><br/>BATTERY LIFE<br/>The battery life on this chromebook is probably the best you're going to get.  It uses a 2.16 GHZ "bay trail" celeron processor with the atom architecture, which was actually initially designed for use in mobile devices such as cell phones. In my opinion, the coolest thing about this processor is it doesn't get too hot.  This chromebook doesn't even need to use a fan because the processor simply doesn't get hot no matter how hard you push it.  The lack of a fan and the power needed to run the processor is less than the Acer c720, meaning the battery life will be higher.  While using it, I get about 10-12 hours of battery life while browsing or word processing. If I'm watching videos or playing a game, or doing more media intensive things, I'll get around 8-10 hours. Fantastic experience, my Macbook Pro can't compete against that.<br/><br/>DISPLAY<br/>Let's be honest, this display is not very good.  However, for a cheap screen I think it's decent.  The viewing angles are poor and it's not always easy to see the entire screen. When watching a dark movie or TV show it's overly apparent how hard it is to get the screen angle just right.  This isn't really a deal-breaker for me because at less than $200 I wasn't really concerned about the screen quality.  It has an HDMI output though and a pretty good graphics processor, it will display things in HD quality when connected to a television or computer monitor and play videos and other media extremely well. The c720 has a similar display.<br/><br/>PROCESSING POWER<br/>The processing power is very good for the price point.  As stated earlier, it uses a 2.16 Ghz "bay-trail" celeron processor, which is plenty of power to do everything you can with chrome OS.  However, the specs on the CPU are somewhat confusing.  In simple terms, the Acer c720 has a clock speed of 1.4 Ghz, but it uses a "haswell" celeron processor.  This processor was originally made for desktop computers while the bay-trail processor was originally made for mobile devices.  The haswell processor in the Acer c720 is faster than the bay-trail processor in the Acer CB3-111.  You will be able to notice this when loading large, graphically intensive files or webpages.  I also notice it when typing into the address bar in the web browser, the processor simply can't keep up with the keystrokes.  The processor in the c720 comes at a price though, it needs a fan to cool it because it can get hot, which adds a little more weight and size to the device and it uses more power to operate the fan.<br/><br/>This may be a deal breaker to some people, but I'm impressed with the smaller size and a little extra battery life the CB3-111 provides over the raw processing power of the c720.  The CB3-111 is still a very fast chromebook, it just isn't as fast in some scenarios as the c720.<br/><br/>However, the graphics processor in the CB3-111 is pretty impressive.  It plays videos on YouTube and Netflix flawlessly.  No hiccups, no long load times, very fast and efficient experience.<br/><br/>SOUND<br/>Decent.  Speakers sound crisp and clean, but are relatively quiet. If sound is important to you, look into purchasing a good bluetooth speaker.  It's a worthwhile investment.<br/><br/>OPERATING SYSTEM<br/>All chromebooks use chrome OS, a modified version of linux built by google.  It's so simple anyone can use it, and that's probably its greatest strength.<br/><br/>If anyone wants to know what chrome OS is, download chrome browser and try to use your computer only using that browser.  You can go to the web-store and add any app you want and run it.  This is exactly what chrome OS is, an operating system built to run the chrome browser only, with a simple file manager to manage downloadable files until you upload is to Google drive or another cloud service.  It isn't made to hold a large amount of files and programs on the hard drive, which is actually a very good thing if you want to keep the computer fast.  There is nothing you have to do to keep the computer optimized, it will always be optimized from the moment you receive it.<br/><br/>Only gripe I have with chrome OS is it doesn't do everything I need it to do.  For example, although google docs is good enough to work in class for taking notes, it simply can't do everything Microsoft Word can. Additionally, even if you save a Google Doc file in a Microsoft word format, it won't always come out looking the same.  It's the exact same problem when opening a Microsoft Word file in the Google Doc format.  It's a little confusing on how to get some things working, and some things you think should be a relatively simple addition aren't included (like adding columns, despite there being a work around to get columns).  Also sometimes I need to use a better word processor so when a teacher uploads my paper after I submit it, it'll look the exact same on their computer as it does in mine.  I feel like this is very important for research papers, or projects that have to look the exact same no matter where you open it.  Google docs isn't quite there yet, but is certainly good enough for about 90% of my processing needs.  Despite this not being good enough for me, it is probably good enough for most people.<br/><br/>ADVANCED STUFF<br/>If you want something more out of your chromebook and are concerned about it just not being enough, you're in luck. This in my opinion simply makes it the best computer you can buy.<br/><br/>This is an intel based chromebook, so Ubuntu or another linux operating system of your choice runs extremely well on it and has full app compatibility.  It's faster than chrome OS in most tasks, and has a much more traditional OS layout that matches a more Windows or OSX interface.  However, using linux is not that intuitive to use.  You'd have to be prepared to learn a whole new operating system, which takes some getting used to because of its use of the command line.  It's very useful to be able to switch between environments very quickly to accomplish tasks I can't necessarily accomplish with chrome OS. It's also nice being able to use a wired printer.<br/><br/>If you're a tech savvy individual, it might be worth it to you to give a Linux platform a shot.  Libreoffice is a free, full office productivity suite that's extremely similar to Microsoft Office and is updated constantly.  GIMP is an image editor that is considered a free, full alternative to Photoshop. Just plug in external storage to the USB drive and you're good to go, edit photos and documents to your hearts content.  There are tools available that can run both OS's simultaneously, so you can switch back and forth whenever you want just by pushing a few keys.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/>This is an extremely good device for under $200.  It has a lot of versatility and portability that make it a good buy in any scenario you're going to use it in.  I'm very satisfied with my purchase.<br/><br/>If you're on the fence between the CB3-111 and c720, it boils down to two things, battery life and performance:<br/>If performance is more important for you, pick the c720.<br/>If battery life is more important to you, pick the CB3-111.<br/><br/>In my opinion, you'd be very happy with either purchase.
After trying out two high-end Ultrabooks and countless hours of researching Chome OS and comparing it with other "lower" end Windows laptops, I decided to take the plunge - and I am honestly blown away. I have yet to encounter a single site or app that will not play in Chrome OS - including Amazon Prime (which has smooth video playback) and even Pogo (in spite of previous blogs and complaints across the web of incompatibility). Evidently the folks at EA have taken note, as have others, or the next great and upcoming wave to replace bulky, sluggish, battery-draining laptops.<br/><br/>My main draw was looking for a lightweight and portable "laptop" I could use for school, without adding 5 pounds to an already-loaded backpack. Also, the 9.5-10.5 hour battery life seems legit - with 84% (9:44) of batter remaining after nearly three hours of web browsing and Plex movie watching (yes, the Plex app runs flawlessly - even with Subs).<br/><br/>Though I will not argue of the need for a Windows device for software like Photoshop or memory-intensive DAW music production (for which I have a high-end desktop PC), as that is not the need for this Chromebook, I cannot say that I miss the functionality.<br/><br/>I haven't noticed any sluggishness as of yet, though that is not my intent. I am simply using it as I normally use a PC or laptop, and thus far, I am undeniably impressed - especially for a Celeron processor. Also, the keyboard is phenomenal, the touchpad is the best quality and sensitivity I have ever had the pleasure of using, and the bright 720p screen leaves little to be desired (other than the minor viewing angle adjustments here and there). The size is just right - not too big, but just large enough to accommodate the incredibly accurate and comfortable chicklet keyboard.<br/><br/>Though I felt I was taking a gamble plunging into Chrome OS with so many unanswered questions, let me just say one thing - I have found my new laptop (no, not my 2nd, but my primary) and I am sure it will keep me satisfied for many years to come!
I have had this for 3 weeks and no problems so far. I brought it for my 8 yr old. This chromebook is fast, light and easy to use. I got it for $149 and it is worth every penny. I hope there is another lighting deal so I can buy more!
Paid $150 for this thing and it way exceeds my expectations.  Here is the catch.  You have to install crouton and put a flavor of linux on it.  It's not hard, just follow the basic instructions that can be found with a simple google search for chromebook crouton.  Once you have a linux distro running on this a lot of those questions I see that are answered NO, become YES.  Yes, it will run Minecraft.  Yes, it will run a full office suite (Libre Office).  Yes, you can hookup an external CD Rom.  This thing is fantastic!!!! and is everything a Netbook should have been.  Oh yeah, and it also runs ChromeOS, but I am not sure what you would use this for.
This is one fantastic personal computer! A little about me first - I am a long-time user of both Microsoft Windows and Mac OSX. I own desktop and laptop computers for both of those. I own a 24-inch iMac, a Macbook Pro retina and a Macbook Air.<br/>I was looking for something cheap to travel with that had a long battery life, a good keyboard and a reasonable screen - primarily for taking notes, watching movies and listening to music.<br/>I was VERY skeptical about Chromebooks. Like many people, I thought that they had to be tethered to the Internet in order to get anything done. BOY WAS I WRONG :-)<br/>This is a FANTASTIC laptop. Make no mistake - this compares very favorably with my Macbook Air. The keyboard is very good - nice amount of key travel and a nice "clickiness" as other reviewers have mentioned. Key spacing is good and I can get a good typing speed. The trackpad is as good or better than the trackpad on the Macbook Air. Read that again :-)  I really mean that - the glide is good, it is a huge size and tap-to-click works great. The general build quality is AMAZING for the price - in fact at any price. No flex, very light and it feels like it will last a long time. Nice sturdy hinges - the screen doesn't wiggle around like I have seen on some of the cheaper laptops.<br/>Battery life is about 8-9 hours for me with full brightness and doing word processing, watching YouTube videos, etc.<br/>The other nice thing is that this laptop charges from empty to full in just over one hour - that's pretty amazing.<br/><br/>Here are the apps I use:<br/><br/>- Google Docs - do all my writing in this. Works seamlessly offline and online - just keep typing and it syncs back up when it gets online again. Never need to save anything - it does it in real time as it goes along. Safe and secure in the cloud.<br/>- All my browser bookmarks synced to every computer in the house when I login to Chrome - nice!<br/>- Google Sheets - maintain all my household finances in this - works as good as or better than Excel. Never need to save. Works offline just as good as online.<br/>- Spotify - listen to music<br/>- Kindle Cloud Reader - all my Kindle books are available online AND OFFLINE in this. Very nice presentation - better presentation than on a Kindle.<br/>- Writebox - this is a little note-taking application. Stores the data locally, even when you shut it down. Stores as many notefiles as you need locally. Syncs with Google Drive if you need to. Very nice application - lightweight ad FAAAAAAAST<br/>- Google Drive - all my files from all my computers stored both up in the cloud and on the computers. On this Chromebook, I can select which files should be made available offline and I can work on them even when offline. Very nice.  Got ONE TERABYTE of free Google Drive storage for two years when I purchased this Acer Chromebook. That means I really got the Chromebook for FREE! :-)<br/>- Google Maps, Google Calendar, etc, etc - I make good use of a lot of the Google ecosystem.<br/>- Google + Photos - all my photos available here. You do have to be online to use this. 10,000 photos at my fingertips. Nice.<br/>- Google Slides - you can use this online and offline too - as good as or better than PowerPoint for the reasonably simple presentations that I need to work with. Nice.<br/><br/>So...I highly recommend checking out this Chromebook if you need something inexpensive to write on, watch movies and YouTube, work on simple spreadsheets and presentations, do research and entertain yourself on the web, listen to music, etc. I am more than happy - I am ECSTATIC with this laptop - in fact I bought a second one, so I can work uninterrupted for up to 16 hours offline when traveling without needing to find a power outlet! - hahahaaa.<br/><br/>This is, without a doubt, the best money I have ever spent on a piece of technology.
I love this thing. I bought a desktop pc and this Chromebook to replace my one and only computing unit: an aged Acer laptop. It's a joy not waiting for it to boot up like I did with my laptop (about 6 seconds now). No more opening task manager to close unneeded software, no uninstalling more software to make it speed up, etc. My phone is an Android and everything is synced through my Google account, so I get the same notifications on my Chromebook if I don't have my phone near me. Not only is the Chromebook "light" software-wise (Chrome OS is simple to use), it is physically as well. I take it with me to my part-time job at a college for student help and it's wonderful not getting locked screens, or waiting an eternity for a website to load. Wireless is pretty much everywhere, so it's not really a problem using the Cloud for storage. This is a beaut.
I didn't want a Windows or Mac, so I decided to go for the simple Chromebook. At first, I worried that it was going to be too small, but I'm glad I got the 11 instead of the 13 :) It's so light, thin, pretty, and fast! I will be using this for school and of course entertainment. I absolutley love it. My sister who has a Macbook Pro also compliments on this Chromebook. The keyboard is great to type on, plus the sound, screen, and battery is just beyond amazing! The battery charges fast and lasts all day. (In other words, full charging takes about 1 hr. and 40 min. and lasts for about 8 hrs.)  I'm so thankful for this great deal! You won't regret it.
I researched, waited, researched waited, and finally pulled the trigger on the Chromebook 11. Absolutely love it. I am an IT professional. I use a high-powered Dell laptop for work (currently, IT Instructional System Designer), we own an iMac, MacBook Air, Windows laptop, and iPad 2 for personal use. I use the Chromebook more than all our personal computers combined. I love the iPad, but prefer a real keyboard (yes I have an external iPad keyboard as well), and since buying the Chromebook, I can go weeks without using the iPad.<br/><br/>Feature wise, the screen is perfectly fine, clear, decent colors. The keyboard is much better than I expected. Performance wise, I have no complaints. It boots in seconds. I can have 10 web browser tabs open with little or no performance issues. I will say that some sites affect the chromebook in a negative way, but I have not isolated what causes them to run slowly.<br/><br/>The sound is surprisingly good, has just the right ports for USB, HDMI, etc. For $200 this is a steal.<br/><br/>Of course being a traditional user, I would like more local apps, but hey, I use it 98% of the time at home, so that it is not an issue. Regarding apps, I love Google Docs, LucidChart, Chrome, a few more. I can't think of one game I thought was worth keeping. Since a portion of my free time is recording music, it would be great if it did that, but it doesn't and that is fine. I do use it however, to display the music I am playing.<br/><br/>Bottom line, it is a great web device for Google searches, email, Facebook, BleacherReport, and so forth. It is great for folks like me who like Google Docs. And that is about 90% of my personal use for a computer. So again, for $200, it is a no brainer steal!
I had a samsung 303 which I gave to my daughter when her windows laptop died.  I thought I could get by on my relatively new windows laptop work gave me.  I was wrong!  I got frustrated going back to longer start times, random updates, and laggy internet performance, lower battery life, and greater heft of the top of the line Dell business laptop.  So, I found myself buying another Chromebook.  I am a college professor and use the internet 99% of the time for my computing.  I even plug chromebooks in to the projectors in the classroom (both the Samsung 303 and Acer CB3-111 have HDMI out) instead of using the less reliable windows desktop computers that are built into the class.  I can read and edit microsoft office documents (online and offline) and use google docs (google drive) exclusively for my work.  Only thing I can't do is run statistical packages like SPSS on the chromebook.  I use desktop remote through Chrome to run the programs on my office desktop instead.  People who perceive the chromebook to be limiting are wrong...it is in fact liberating!<br/><br/>While the Samsung 303 served me well, the Acer CB3 is a much better chromebook.  The battery lasts at least 2 hours longer.  The screen is brighter with more hi-definition, better colors, and wider viewing angle.  The speakers are louder and sound better than my Samsugn 303 and my Nexus 7 tablet.  Still not hi-fidelity sound.  The processor is faster able to handle more tabs without lags.  Finally, while the Samsung 303 would flex and creak, the build of the acer cb3 is incredibly solid.  Given the same pricepoint (or even if the Samsung was $50 cheaper) I would definitely purchase the Acer cb3 again.  The only way in which the Samsung 303 could be considered better is using the micro sd card as the main memory which allows you to get a lot more storage.  Given I hardly used 4gb of the 32gb I had...the 15 gb of faster storage the cb3 has built in isn't a problem.
Highlights:<br/>~ Compact, lightweight and sleek<br/>~ Fast<br/>~ Great for surfing the web, streaming movies, email and more<br/><br/>  When I first saw Celeron, I thought..."Oh nooooooo, that will be sluggish!" I then read the reviews and decided it was worth giving it a try!  I have been so pleasantly surprised by this zippy unit!<br/><br/>  Setting up the Chromebook was a breeze! Of course, I downloaded Netflix just to see if it would stream without any bumps in the road and it did! At that point, it had me. I added a travel size wireless mouse and I was ready to take on the world.  I own both a laptop and an iPad, but I find myself missing that keyboard and mouse when traveling.  This was a great solution to leave in our guest room as well!  Now everyone can check their email or surf without using my laptop. I simply set up a guest account for them to all use!<br/><br/>  For the price,  you have value and speed.  It is not a full size laptop, but if your needs are for basic surfing, movie streaming and emails, this is a fun new toy to have around!
The Acer and I got off to a rough start, but once we got over the hump, we've become fast friends. The roadblock was the Wi-Fi connection. I entered my Wi-Fi info three times -- carefully checking the caps and numbers. That compelled me to hit the big ? icon to get help. It wouldn't load.<br/><br/>Eventually, I woke up and noticed the update icon (white arrow pointing up), clicked it and all was right with the Chromebook. The four-page setup guide didn't include this as one of the steps. However, on the back, it does say to update your system. This should be in the first steps. I just assumed the update note was to keep everything updated -- not that it would fix my wireless connection.<br/><br/>How did it fix the wireless connection if I couldn't connect? Thankfully, the Chromebook connected to my network as a Guest. Don't know how that's possible without stealing someone's bandwidth. Curious. Will update this if I find an answer.<br/><br/>I have an iPad 4 with a case and a wireless keyboard. I weighed the iPad with its case  (30 oz) and the Chromebook (38 oz). The Only an 8-ounce difference! I never use the iPad's Bluetooth keyboard as it's not attached and I prefer to use my iPad's case as its cover rather than the keyboard. Still there are of times when I wish a keyboard was more convenient as I could never type as fast on-screen as I can with a physical keyboard (tiny BlackBerry keyboard included).<br/><br/>If you're debating between a Chromebook and a tablet -- I'd recommend the Chrome book because the weight difference is minuscule and you get the benefit of a usable keyboard. (The iPad's keyboard isn't as usable as the Chromebook's. Typing on the Chromebook is closer to the laptop experience.) The keyboard takes getting used to as it's missing the delete key -- one that I use a lot. Had to dig in the Help to find the shortcut to delete things.<br/><br/>Of course, the Chromebook is Google-focused. Google Chrome, Google Docs, and having stuff in the cloud, etc. etc. So if that bugs you -- this isn't for you. If you use Gmail, Google Contacts and Google Calendar, it all seamlessly shows up on the Chromebook. While I prefer MS Word's features (I'm a writer) to Google Docs, I tend not to do heavy-duty writing work on the Chromebook so it's good enough.<br/><br/>When I open it, the Chromebook connects to the Wi-Fi noticeably faster than my laptop. Probably about 3 to 5 seconds vs. the laptop's 8 to 10. Battery life is fantastic -- lives up to its advertised 8.5 hours of battery life. I was watching videos for a lot of it and it didn't drain faster.<br/><br/>Glare drives me nuts, so I like the Acer's matte screen. However, the screen isn't perfect as you need to move the screen around to see everything. It doesn't take much movement for part of the screen to fade. But c'mon. For this price? Not a big deal.<br/><br/>As of today, there is no downloadable manual for the Chromebook 11 on Acer's website. Although it comes with a built-in Help, it requires a connection to use it. The setup manual says you can get 100 gb free for two years. I'd like to know what happens after that. Wouldn't want to have a ton of stuff on it and then have to pay for it.<br/><br/>I love that it's light, has about the small keyboard possible that's close to a laptop keyboard and I can do all the basics on it ... surfing, emailing, writing.<br/><br/>Update: Nov 6, 2014<br/><br/>One big plus about the Chromebook over a tablet or iPad is that it stands up solidly. Making the iPad stand up with a standard cover never feels solid like in these photos: <br/> I had been using the iPad to watch and follow exercise videos. Plus, the video often switches between standing and sitting, so I'd have to move the iPad to see it. With the Chromebook, it's easier and faster. I never feel nervous. I do have to adjust the screen at times per my earlier explanation.<br/><br/>I find I'm using the Chromebook more than the iPad for writing emails and watching videos (when I don't want to hold on to it).
Chromebooks are for someone wanting to surf the web, do emails, and minor 'stuff' like that. It does it very well.  This Acer is very light, and has a great battery life. I went into it knowing its limitations, and it fulfills it's function very well....<br/><br/>Why only 4 stars??  This is the 2d Acer CB3 that I've had.  The first arrived without an Operating System!!!  I worked with Google, and downloaded a 'Recovery' file, and was able to get the 1st one going, BUT NO ONE should ever have to buy a computer and expect to go through that!  Even after it was installed and working well, It had the start screen informing me that the "OS Verification was turned off" After several seconds, it would eventually go ahead and go into the OS.  After working with Google AGAIN, they suggested I return it to Amazon for another unit, as the laptop was "stuck, apparently in the 'developer' mode", and they didn't know how to get it out of that..... *sigh*  After looking at some of the reviews, I found out I wasn't the only one that received one without an Operating System on it!  You'd think - whoever, Acer or Google - would have a little better quality control on their assembly line!  I just received this 2d unit today and it works very well.... I'm writing this review on it.
I don't see anywhere in the listing that this is a refurbished unit. I DO see the words NEW. So when I boot it up and get Chrome OS missing or defective error, that's a problem. I don't care if "all I have to do is....." It's brand new, factory sealed. I expect it to work and I don't want to have to invest a bunch of time and trial and error fixing it. I ordered a replacement and if that one has the same problem, I will look at another type of Netbook.
Ummmmm<br/>Really did i receive a refurbished one ....so irritated with this thing im really thinking about returning .....horrible!!!!!!!
This is an amazing value for the price.  It looks and feels substantial and well made. I'm giving it 5 stars because of its features and portability even though my own performance is so far unsatisfactory.  Transitioning from years of use of a Windows computer is not easy, at least for me.<br/><br/>My reason for wanting this Chromebook was the desire to downsize when traveling.  At only 2.4 pounds, this gives me close to a 60% reduction in weight compared to the laptop I've been carrying and an even greater reduction because I can easily carry it in  a backpack and not the heavy, wheeled computer case I've been using.<br/><br/>This Chromebook comes with only 16 GB internal storage, however, there are 2 USB ports (2.0 & 3.0) and an SD port, so storage can easily be increased by use of a flash drive, SD card, or external hard drive, all of which are supported. You also have the option of using the 100 GB of storage on Google Drive, but I prefer to use my storage device so won't be accepting Google's storage offer.<br/><br/>The start up is very fast.  No doubt one reason is that it is not loaded up like my Windows computer.<br/><br/>The transition has so far been frustrating, but progress is being made.  There are good helps on the Chromebook and there is also a lot of helpful information on the internet that can be access by a Google search.<br/><br/>My positive feelings substantially increased when I switched from the touch pad to a wireless mouse.  I have always used a wireless mouse because I don't like touch pads and I now feel more confident because of the mouse.<br/><br/>Although I cannot confirm it with test results, battery life is said to be 8+ hours.  I can confirm that screen lighting and resolution are very good.<br/><br/>If all I wanted to do was read and receive emails, I am already comfortable with that.  But important to me when traveling is to be able to review photos taken and do some editing.  Based on what I have read so far, I know this can be done, I just need to learn how and get some practice doing so.  I will not be able to use the photo editing software I am using on my Windows computer, but there are several free photo editing aps in the Chromebooks Ap Store, one of which (Pixar) I have installed.  It has excellent reviews.<br/><br/>I also need time to investigate the many other aps that are offered in the Ap Store to determine how they might help me.  And I still have a lot to learn about the various features, like "files".  But I think I am on the right road.<br/><br/>To use the Chromebook you must have a Gmail account, but you can continue to use your usual email program.  I have long been using Fastmail.fm and I continue to use it on the Chromebook.  There is a link on my bookmarks bar that enables to open the program whenever I want.<br/><br/>Transitioning to something new is often difficult, and switching to a Chromebook from a Windows computer is no exception.  But now that I am starting to see a little light at the end of the tunnel, I think it will be worth the effort.
Excellent value for $150, but the Acer C720 is still Top Dog in the budget Chromebook category.  Not a lot of differences between the two, but the CB3 is 4 ounces lighter (2lbs-6oz) then the C720.  However, the CB3 is 1/2" wider and I prefer the smaller size.  The CB3 also seems to be marginally slower when surfing, but you probably won't notice unless you're currently using a C720.  The CB3 has the power plug and HDMI port on the back side, whereas the C720 ports are all on the sides.<br/><br/>I should mention that I purchased 2 of these and one of them appears to have a hardware issue, associated with Flash/Shock Wave webpages.  I performed several 'Powerwashes' and updated the ChromeOS to 39.02171.85 (same as the other CB3) but it will randomly crash and re-start.  I'm planning to take it back to BB for an exchange.
This laptop is great! I had many issues with the Samsung Chromebook, like it clicking on random things and scrolling up and down really fast. I didn't think I was going to like the whit, but I actually really like the white. The Samsung was recommended to me by the Best Buy clerk, and so I bought it, right from the get go I had issues with it. This one is made so much stronger than the Samsung. Plus I like the exterior much better, it the same set-up on the inside, just much better. I love this laptop so much, and would recommend it to anyone! <3
This is a pretty long review. I basically used my Chromebook non-stop for three days, on and offline.  The review is a little disjointed, but it's based on real-world use and my personal observations.<br/><br/>There's a lot to be said about this Chromebook. If you were to list all the features, benefits and what it can do, then print the list, that list would probably weigh more than this device.  Of course you need to ask yourself if a Chromebook is for you.  The "next big thing" a couple of years ago was the "netbook" - a scaled-down notebook that required the web for almost everything. It was a massive flop. Now we have the Chromebook. A scaled-down notebook that requires the web for almost everything. No internal storage, or CD or DVD. All your programs (apps) are run from the web - or in the cloud. Same thing.<br/><br/>If you're in an area where free wifi is abundant and you can get a signal wherever you pull out the Chromebook, you're all set.  If you don't have wifi and it's not that available in your area, then a Chromebook's functionality is greatly reduced.<br/><br/>I'm on the fence with Chromebooks.  If I really wanted one, this is the model I'd choose. The wifi is fast, the battery seems to last forever, and the non-glare screen is amazing. The chiclet keyboard is nice, with plenty of spacing between the keys so even large fingers won't mash two keys at a time. Bootup is almost instantaneous. Waking up is instant. Once you complete setup, your browser settings, shortcuts, Gmail - it's all synced automatically.<br/><br/>Some of the issues I have with the Chromebook is the OS and are personal.  I've used Windows for years. I started with 3.1 because that's what Adobe required on the PC for their software.  I'm used to function keys and many shortcuts. There are no function keys and most of the shortcuts I know don't work on the Chromebook. That's just some time to learn.  But if you're married to your Windows laptop, you'll be at a loss for a little while on the Chromebook.<br/><br/>My largest complaint is the wifi login.  You can only enter a password. No user name. My secure business and secure home connections require a user name AND password.  I can't enter a user name. So I have to use the guest login - that only requires a password.  But then I don't have access to the network (just the web) and I have to login frequently. At the office, that's every four hours. At home, it's every 12 hours. For whatever reason, login often takes a dozen tries. I know my password - I use it all the time. So I'll shut it down, then try again - then it works. Frustrating.<br/><br/>For ports, there's one USB 3, one USB 2, one HDMI, the power connector and a 1/8" headphone jack.<br/><br/>There are also two speakers on the bottom.  If the Chromebook is on your lap, the speakers are very quiet. If the Chromebook is on a hard surface they're a lot louder. Sound quality is OK. If you use the headphones you'll be blown away.<br/><br/>Storage: Chrome OS owners get 100GB of Google Drive storage free for 2 years - it's a one time thing. If you have two Chromebooks, you get 100GB. You probably already have 15GB free from Google - 15 gig is pretty decent.  115 is even better. But what about after the two years?  Chances are Google will keep increasing the standard amount of free space, but I doubt it will hit 100 gig in two years. Once the offer is up, you can retrieve your files, but you can't save anything until you're down to the current free space offered (currently 15 gig.)  So if you have 50 gig used and the offer expires, you need to remove 35 gig.<br/><br/>The upside is that Google charges really low prices for storage - $1.99 a month for 100 gig, and $10 a month for 1TB!  This storage can be accessed by you from any networked device.<br/><br/>To get your free 100 gig, go to chromebook.com/goodies on your Chrome device. Don't bother trying it from a PC (I did) - there's nothing to fill out. It detects the device automatically.  There are other offers there for Chrome OS users.  They can pretty much pay for the device.  Currently there's two free months of music (a $20 value), the Google storage offer ($80 value), and 12 passes for in-air internet use while flying (must all be used in one year - worth at least $50.) If you fly or travel a lot, the Chromebook is a great choice - especially with the free in-air web offer. Lightweight and long battery life - plus it's so darn thing.<br/><br/>To redeem the free storage offer, just use the button on the goodies page. It's automatic. The Chromebook is detected and you have the 100 gig in a few minutes.<br/><br/>OK, what if you can't get on the web. Is this a paperweight, albeit a light one? Nope - you can download offline apps, work on the Chromebook, then sync everything after you're on the web again.  It takes more time to FIND these apps online than to set them up. I used the link in the menu for the Google store, then searched "offline" in apps. The search took about 15 seconds, then a list of free apps was displayed. I added gmail, Scrolled down the list, looking for the other free Google apps. They were already selected and downloaded for me. You don't have all the functionality for all the apps as if you were online - for example, the calendar is read-only. You can't edit or add anything.<br/><br/>So I thought I'd try the offline apps. First I selected the link for "Gmail offline." Received an error that the app was unreachable. So I clicked on the "learn more" link. Nope - you need to be online for the help for the offline app that wants you online.<br/><br/>OK, reconnected to the wed.  Tried Gmail Offline again. This time it ran and gave me an option to allow offline mail or nor. I checked "Allow offline mail." A status appeared in the lower left telling me the status of the mail sync - messages and attachments were synced.  Cool, I can now compose and answer email offline.  What about dose and the rest?<br/><br/>I searched for "offline" - the results gave instructions for the PC, Android and IOS.  And text saying "try Chrome!" - with no help for Chrome. So I searched for "offline Chrome" - five minutes later, still no results. Then I tried "edit docs chrome offline." Gave up after three minutes of watching the "working" icon. So I went to Google instead of using the help. OK - instructions found. It was already setup for offline use. Hmmmm. Turned off the network access. None of the apps work.  Just the typical "...app unreachable..." error and "learn more" link that does nothing. OK. Getting annoyed. Two hours, and still no offline capability. Tried the "Google drive" app. That worked. Local copies are visible. But none of the files will open because the app can't be found. Wondering if the Chromebook will emulate a Frisbee. Tried to create a document. "...app unreachable..." error. Open my calendar. "...app unreachable..." error. Maybe the Chromebook can be used as a clay pigeon.  OK, so I can see what's in my Google drive, but can't do anything with it. Maybe it's taunting me. I'll try again later. I'm getting way too annoyed.<br/><br/>Went back online and clicked the "play music" icon. Hmmm. Free for 30 days, then $9.99 per month. Er, no thanks.  So the button will always be there, reminding me I'm too cheap to fork over $10 a month to listen to my own iTunes library. Yea, there's more than that, but I have over 30,000 songs. It took me a week to rip all the CD's from my collection. Plus if I use the link on the offers page, it's two free months.<br/><br/>Hmmm. What if I want to listen to music offline? Watch a movie? Turned off networking again, and copied a few albums and videos to a USB key. Plug in the key. The results? A directory automatically opens. Played a 1.8 gig video file. Nice quality, looks like there's more pixelation than with my PC. Sound is also good. Music? Album art is ignored, but I can navigate down to the songs. Again, sound quality is good.  Much better with a headset.<br/><br/>So I can watch movies and listen to music when offline - I just need a USB device.<br/><br/>OK, back to offline stuff.  Clicking on gMail does not work, clicking on gMail offline does work. You'd think the thing would know if you're online or not and open up the correct version. Nope.  So are there icons for "offline" versions for the other apps? Nope.  Now what? Turned on the wireless again and visited the Google store. Again.  I find the offline doc app and click "launch" i it runs the online version.  Back to Google - or maybe I should try Yahoo? Funny. After 15 minutes of searching I finally found the answer. Even though everything I read states that the Chromebook is designed to work offline as a default, it's not.  You have to be online and allow each app individually to allow offline access.  And the option is not always in the same place or called the same thing. Under mail it's "syncing files." Under the calendar it's simply "offline."  You sometimes have to hunt for it. According to "docs" it's already set up and synced, yet I can't open any docs offline.<br/><br/>Tried "sheets" and the rest - they just displayed the "working" icon. The Calendar worked. Oh wait - none of my appointments are there. OK, maybe things are taking a long time (over four hours?) to sync. I'll try later and leave it online.<br/><br/>Other observations:<br/>The built-in video chat app is decent - but the camera quality is so-so.<br/>Everything runs in the Chrome browser, so you need to adopt that mindset.<br/>Charging is FAST. Fully charged in just an hour.<br/>Setup and test EVERYTHING before you really need it.  It took several tries and 10 hours to get the offline apps to finally work. I'm no noob. I build my own PC's. I have three Android tablets, an iPad, Kindle, Kindle Fire and Android phone. I have three PC's and repair PC's. I install networks and manage file servers.  The Chromebook had me stumped several times - but that's a comment on the O.S., not the hardware.<br/><br/>If you want a web-enabled "laptop", this is really, really nice.  Want to work without the web? You'll need to configure all the apps online, sync, then test and test again.  This part really appears to be a work in progress.  Some websites call the offline apps "beta" versions. It's a great travel option as well. But honestly - what's better for you - a Windows laptop for around $400, a tablet for around $200, or a Chromebook for $200? If you want battery life and a keyboard, the Chromebook is it.  Power and a true computer? A laptop.  Touchscreen? A tablet.
This netbook is everything I expected it to be, and better.  I had an Acer netbook years ago, and they have definitely gotten better over the years ...... even back then I absolutely loved my netbook, so I didnt think they could get better.  I didnt realize when purchasing this computer that Chromebooks had their own set of apps.  At first I was upset because I tried to download a file for video editing, and the computer alerted me that it does not read .exe files.  However, I was able to look through the available apps that can be downloaded and found that they actually have an ample library of apps, and found something better than what I originally tried to download.<br/><br/>The look of this computer is very nice, it looks very sleek, and it fits perfectly into my purse so I can carry it around with me anywhere I go.  It is so much nicer than having to carry around an extra laptop bag!  It is very light and thin, it is not much bigger than my 10" tablet.  Sometimes a tablet or phone cannot do everything you need, in my case I began having too many sites only allow me to visit mobile version, which I why I had to make this purchase, and now I cannot imagine living with out this Chromebook now.<br/><br/>Screen resolution is very clear, camera is alright, and the fact that the keyboard is a little more compact than a regular computer/laptop is perfect for me, typing is much easier and faster.  My husband fell in love with it as soon as he played with it also, and he is usually a Macbook user so that speaks for itself.  This computer works so much faster than most others, and it takes up way less data than others also.  I was using about 5 GB a day, and now I use less than 3 GB a week now, I couldnt believe that it was that much of a difference.  This is the best investment I have made in a long time, and the price was well worth it, I would have been happy paying much more if I knew how great it would be.
I won't go into the details of what the Chromebook is, as many reviewers already have done so.  I live my life in Google drive, so the lack of onboard applications is not an issue for me. (Almost every application you used to have to install now has a web version - most are free even)<br/>I purchased my Chromebook as a home computer when my IMac finally gave up the ghost.  I couldn't afford to do a full replacement and I needed a computer for home. (I have it connected to a 24" LCD monitor and my existing sound system via HDMI) For the price, this Chromebook is amazing. It does most basic browsing, email, streaming functions beautifully. Unfortunately, where it chokes is graphics and images.  I'm not talking CAD - I'm talking photo rendering, graphics intensive websites, and even google maps on imagery. The poor little processor just isn't designed to handle that much imagery data. It even stutters when using it's own email (inbox) app. If i could do it,  I'd buy a dedicated desktop as my home base, and use the Chromebook as my mobile computer.<br/><br/>What I like:<br/>Lightweight<br/>Affordable<br/>Compact<br/>Fast (for basic browsing)<br/>Streams videos flawlessly<br/>Well built<br/>Quiet<br/>Comfortable keyboard<br/>Great Touchpad<br/>Beautiful screen<br/>Nicely integrated with Google and it's various applications<br/>Plays well with peripherals (external monitor, keyboard, trackball)<br/><br/>What I don't like<br/>Chokes on graphic intensive processing (Google earth/maps)<br/>Chokes on Google photos (caveat - I have nearly 20,000 photos in my google drive)<br/>Chokes on photo enhancement (again - graphic intensive)<br/>Slow on it's own email (Google Inbox)  - this really irritates me.<br/>Has trouble streaming music and multitasking (I've never been a fan of streaming music services anyway.  I have yet to find one that is consistent and stable.) It works fine for streaming music by itself, but I'm usually working and doing other things while I'm listening at my computer, and it frequently stutters as the processor overloads.<br/>You have to be very aware of how many browser tabs you have open. 5 or more and you start having issues.<br/><br/>I know you're saying "But the Chromebook isn't DESIGNED to be a rendering powerhouse!"  I would totally agree with you - except when it comes to  Google's own applications (Inbox, Maps)<br/><br/>Summary -  I really think this Chromebook is a well thought out, well-designed unit. It does what it is designed for very well.  My concern is that as web pages become more information packed, the processing power is going to have to be boosted.
I have found my new best friend - The Acer CB3-111 Chromebook!<br/>I take this everywhere and just enjoy every minute I use it.<br/><br/>Hardware, OS, Chrome extensions ...all work excellently to create the best computing experience bang for the buck.<br/>For 97% of what I do on a computer, the Chrome OS and Acer work better than I ever expected.<br/><br/>I consider myself to be very computer savvy from a user and technological standpoint. I own gaming desktops, laptops, macbooks, imacs, etc and can say the Chromebook is the best of them all for most of my needs. Although I have not tried to edit video, pictures or other heavy creation on the Chromebook, it appears they have apps that do work for those functions -but- if I were a video or photo editing power user, I would stick with a MAC or PC. That being said, I think the "sweet spot" for the Chromebook lies in its size, speed, battery life, minimalist approach and value.<br/><br/>In my opinion if you went more than 11+ inches on the screen, you lose some of the real value of a Chromebook and you are getting into "just buy a mac or PC territory".<br/><br/>Recently, I purchased my college age son a Mac Book Air for approx $1000. Before the MAc AIr purchase I tried to buy a PC laptop on sale for approximately $350 which was supposedly a good deal. I returned the PC and bought the MAC. Had I known how excellent the hardware and OS for the Chromebooks were, I might have tried to get him a Chromebook instead. My hesitation was thinking he would be limited if his instructors required a Word or Excel document. After using the Chromebook, I am thinking my fears were unfounded ... you can import/export Word and Excel docs into the Google Docs and Sheets applications. Yes, there are some minor compromises but after using the Chromebook for a week now, I really think it is the future of personal computing.  It is almost like you have to get one and try it to understand how the Windows  OS, installing expensive software, large hard drives, etc seems antiquated. For the price of a Chromebook, it certainly is not a big risk to try and you can use it as a second computer. It is not going to replace your gaming PC but is actually a better option for surfing the web, watching videos, checking mail, etc.<br/><br/>Give it a try - you wont be disappointed.<br/><br/>By the way - not sure if this is specific to the Acer, but the keyboard and hardware are on par with the Mac Air my son purchased. Just amazing!
This is a tough item to review. For the past 10 years, I’ve worked with Dell laptops and have never used a Chromebook.  In my mind, I start comparing the two but I know that’s not really a fair comparison since a laptop and a Chromebook such as this one are designed for entirely different things.  I’ll write about the Chromebook itself and then list some of things I had a hard time with in switching from a “regular” laptop to this one.<br/><br/>First, this thing is very lightweight.  Having been used to lugging around my Dell laptop, this comes as a welcome relief. Plus, since it is small, it would be very easy to carry around in a book bag or something similar. Second, the battery life leaves my old computer in the dust.  My kids have watched several movies over the course of a couple of days (no other use during that time) and I didn’t need to plug it in until the third day. Third, it starts up very quickly. Lift the lid and a second later my login screen shows up.<br/>Everything is browser based, from using Gmail to Google Docs. While at home or around a wi-fi connection, this is great.  However, I’ve not been able to figure out how to use things offline, especially like downloading movies for my kids when we go on trips. I’m sure there’s a way, but so far I’ve not been able to figure that one out. Also, some of the apps that you can get from the Google Play store seem more designed for a phone than for a computer like this.<br/><br/>So for what it’s designed for, particularly needing an internet connection, this computer is great.  And because of this, I’m giving it 4 stars.<br/><br/>That being said, having never used one of these before, I had some difficulty adjusting to it. First and biggest drawback for me is, well, the need to always be connected in order to use the computer.  I’d like to be able to use it on the road where I don’t always have connection.  Another thing I noticed is that the keyboard is different.  It’s just a few small things: usual buttons missing like no page up/down buttons, no delete button (but there is a backspace), or no caps lock (took me awhile to figure out how to turn on caps lock); and some buttons added that don’t really seem needed, like search, a back AND forward (not the arrows), reload and full screen buttons. Again, these are minor, but it’s taken me a little bit to get used to the keyboard.<br/><br/>Again, for what it’s designed for, it seems great.  If you’re looking for a small, incredibly lightweight computer to use for constant connectivity, this is a pretty good one, especially for the price.
Overall very pleased, especially the $150 price on an Amazon Lightning Deal. So if you're not in a hurry you may want to wait for another one. (Note: The Lightning Deal did not register on the price-tracking website Camel3.)<br/><br/>I have a workhorse laptop that is heavier and has all my valuable data. I was looking for a cheap, light second laptop for travel and coffee shops. Few points:<br/><br/>- It's strange that the two speakers are on the bottom of the unit. I'm no expert on acoustics but the sound seems to be needlessly muffled. When I want to listen to music from across the room I need to prop it on its side to get the full sound.<br/><br/>- The large (~1") bezel won't win any design awards. This is largely subjective, but while I don't think anyone would characterize it as sleek, I also don't think it's ugly. It's just kind of plain.<br/><br/>- Gets a little warm when watching video, but overall it stays cool.<br/><br/>- The screen is probably the biggest drawback. It's not nearly as bright or clear as some of the latest laptops. I guess this is where they really save costs, since it's the same screen technology as my old Thinkpad from 1999. (See below for more on the screen)<br/><br/>- It's nice not worrying about OS upgrades and malware! No bloatware either.<br/><br/>- I've used one of the free Gogo in-flight Internet passes. As soon as I connected to the Gogo network I was prompted to click a box to check for free access. After that I was prompted to enter a Captcha-type code. Then I was able to use the Internet. Pretty painless.<br/><br/>The worst part so far has been an unpleasant experience with customer service. After less than one month of ownership I turned the unit on to find bizarre screen malfunction - a few square inches of screen real estate in the top left mysteriously turned a dead gray. Acer customer service acknowledged on the phone that this was a "known issue." They paid for return shipping, but not a return box. So far so good. Then I received a call that they determined the malfunction was my fault and that I needed to pay $100 for a new screen. I went back and forth with the agent arguing that I did nothing to cause this issue. I also explained that the first agent admitted that this was a known issue and that I've read online of similar defects with the screen. After dropping the phrase "class action lawsuit," I was put on hold for a few minutes. She then agreed to fix it at Acer's expense. I'm happy Acer did the right thing in the end, but it took an unpleasant battle.
On startup I saw this message appear on the screen.....<br/><br/>"Chrome OS is missing or damaged. Please insert a recovery USB stick or SD card."<br/><br/>Acer did not include either of these.  And if one was included and I tried to install the OS but failed to get it working, then I probably wouldn't have been able to return the thing to Amazon.com.  You can not get past this first screen that says the OS is missing or damaged so you can not try to get on the internet and download the OS from anywhere.  This is very disappointing because I liked the look of the Chromebook. It is small and the keys on the keyboard are nicely spaced.  Acer Computer company must not check each Chromebook to see if it works before they ship them out.
First let me say this is my first Chromebook, coming from traditional Windows and Linux based laptops, my trusty Dell D430 running Linux Mint recently became riddled with issues and the cost to upgrade wasn't worth it based on what a typical Chromebook was going for.  Since the primary use for this is surfing the Web, YouTube, online Banking and etc, that is no games or high demand applications and to go out and buy a more powerful and expensive notebook for these needs, felt like a major waste of money and being a fan of Linux stability and the benefits of using it, I was swayed towards Chrome OS and waited for it to develop.  Now seeing it was the time, I began my search for a Chromebook that would meet my needs.<br/><br/>I had several Chromebooks in my Wishlist, the newer Toshiba and Samsung models both in the 13.3 with HD and Full HD, was also keeping the older and respected Acer C720 (Haswell) in mind since it was priced right and had great reviews.  I had a budget, did not really see the point in spending $300+ on a Chromebook and was not sure if I really needed 1080P on a 13.3" screen or if it was really a benefit?  I also was leery of a Glossy screen since I always used Matte screens, granted the richer colors and deeper blacks would be an advantage and larger screens also tend to eat more battery life and I always preferred Matte screens regardless.<br/><br/>So after some debating I made the decision to go with the CB3, not knowing if it would be as good as the C720, but reading it was fan less and a tad lighter, gave me greater interest and while there are some negative reviews on the Baytrail vs the Haswell CPU with regards to performance, I really never push it to the extent of these benchmark tests and rarely have more than 2 tabs open.  So to me it was not a big deal and I feel bench marking in general is subjective and most general users will not notice much of a difference in speed.<br/><br/>After arriving, the set-up was a breeze, no more waiting to install updates or service packs and countless drivers.  Boot time is super fast, a few seconds and once open the screen and it comes on automatically, and the build quality of the CB3 is excellent and I really like the clean Matte White look of the housing, not a glossy fingerprint magnet at all. The keyboard is excellent and the CB3 in general, feels like a much more expensive notebook.  The battery came with 80% charge and after allowing it to fully charge I noticed 8.5 hours left on the fuel gauge.<br/><br/>Also take note that the keyboard is somewhat different than a typical notebook with Windows or Mac, there is no dedicated Delete key and no F1 and etc.  Chromebooks use shortcut keys to do these functions, and this takes time to learn.<br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>Ctrl+Backspace Delete the previous word<br/>Alt+Backspace Delete the next letter (forward delete)<br/><br/>There is a list out there if you do a search for "Chromebook Keyboard Shortcuts", if your a longtime Windows user, it might be good to print these out and keep them handy till you learn them or you can also press "Ctrl+Alt+?" to see the list pop-up on your screen.<br/><br/>There isn't much in the box, a thin set-up sheet, warranty and a external PSU which is White as well.<br/><br/>The display is how I expected, nice but still a little washed out looking on certain colors, blacks are definitely not too deep but it's not horrible.<br/><br/>I was somewhat unsure if I would like a smaller screen size, seeing my Dell D430 was 12.1", but it wasn't too bad after using it for a few hours.<br/><br/>No IPS display at this price, but I had no issues once I got the screen adjusted, but I can see why IPS screens have their advantages.<br/><br/>It takes two hands typically to open the display as the unit is very light and opening the screen alone with your fingers is not possible, maybe in time as the hinge breaks in but for now it's a two handed affair, one hand to hold it down the other to open.<br/><br/>I decided to stream some Netflix and after installing the App/Link not that you need to install it just basically a short-cut, it worked excellent, no issues at all and the speakers exceeded my expectations, I was very impressed with the sound quality from a sub $200 notebook, the biggest plus was Zero fan noise, should say there is no fan or need for it, so that's a plus for the Baytrail CPU.  As well their was minimal to no heat coming from the CB3, after streaming Netflix for about 1 hour, I checked my battery to see I still had over 8:15 hours left and this was after 1 hour of initial web browsing and etc.  Not that I plan to watch Netflix on this all the time or was it the reason I bought it, but knowing it can handle it and still give a quality image and sound is a major plus.<br/><br/>It does work for Amazon Video on Demand, but HD videos are not available, your forced to watch SD.  So for that I'll be sticking to Netflix and when I need to pay for something, Google Play, which works flawless.<br/><br/>Tried the webcam, it works but I really did not judge it too much or have much use for it, along with other features, Microphone, HDMI, USB 2.0 and 3.0 and SD slot though they are there and useful.<br/><br/>16GB of Storage, again for me this is fine as I do not plan on using this for anything else other than what I previously stated.  Also Google gives you 100GB of Cloud Storage for 2 years if you want it.<br/><br/>The WiFi worked well and while I have an older WiFi Router, which doesn't take advantage of 802.11 ac, it's nice to have for future proofing and something that is missing on the C720 series.<br/><br/>Now on to a few gripes I noticed, granted I'm still getting getting comfortable with it and not use to this style of touch pad, all my other notebooks used separate buttons for the mouse function, not one integrated touch pad.  Also I'm still learning how to copy and paste on a Chromebook which requires a two finger press, so I think in time I will learn this, but I have found the touch pad in general to be somewhat difficult initially to use.  As well the sound of the "Click" is quite loud and very tactile, granted these tend to break in with time, to be fair I'm not use to it and it's kinda loud with respect to my old Dell D430 or other external mice I have used, so I might switch to a external moue if it does not grow on me with time.<br/><br/>The power adapter, coming from traditional notebooks which have a beefy power plug, I found the one on this Chromebook to be very tiny and I'm sure it's a standard for most but it does not feel very robust and noticed it did not fully seat with ease when plugged in and was not charging till I pressed it in with more force.  Granted again, it's new and will become easier in time.  I also felt a little uneasy on how it protrudes out and seems like it could get easily damaged when plugged in due to excessive strain.  Time will tell, but I hope to never have this plugged in while using it.<br/><br/>The headphone jack is on the right side, now not a big issue but if you do decide to use wired headphones and a mouse at the same time, you may find this an issue, though seeing this has Bluetooth capability, wireless headphones would eliminate this.<br/><br/>Aside from that, I am very impressed with the CB3 and while I originally purchased it from Amazon for $199.99, a day after I received it the price dropped to $179.99, knowing Amazon's pricing guarantee, I immediately contacted Customer Service and got my account credited for the difference, cannot beat that at all which further exceeded my expectations.<br/><br/>I will soon also getting a pair of Wireless Bluetooth Headphones, the internal Bluetooth option is very nice and I might as well utilize it.<br/><br/>I'm very happy with this Chromebook and for the price I find very little to complain about, it cost less than my latest Unlocked Smartphone purchase and will meet my needs for now.
After only 2 months we opened the Chromebook for normal use, inadvertently touched the screen with a thumb and the screen shattered. Unusable. Very poor quality for such normal handling to destroy the product. Acer does not back the product in any way and offered to fix it at nearly the same cost as the computer itself. Extremely disappointed. I could understand if the computer had been dropped or fallen or knocked... anything! But this normal type of inadvertent touch should not destroy a computer screen. Inexcusable.
This machine is amazing.  Would recommend to anyone...except the elderly !  I am 70 with not-so-great vision.  Just too small FOR ME.  Sent this back and ordered the 13", which is perfect !
When I turned on this chromebook, it says Chrome Os is missing or damaged. I'm so upset about that. I need it in a few days, but it cannot work. I decided to return it and probably need to get another one. I just need one with no problems
I am impressed by this device.  As an Apple guy I really had a hard time justifying upgrading my iPad for school.  I needed a small, light, and compact laptop that could perform simple functions, nothing data intensive.  Honestly, the latest iPad did not impress me with the functionality.  Additional, as already owning a MBP I was not interested in purchasing another laptop, nor do I enjoy the interface of most Microsoft products.  My choice was simple; buy a Chromebook.  Good price, simple functionality, and decent build quality.  This is a win all around.
I'm typing this review on this Chromebook right now! I'm a graduate student, and I got tired of my Windows computer installing updates every time I opened my laptop. It was frustrating. I just wanted to open my laptop and get right to writing my homework. Now I can! It's also very lightweight, so I can easily bring it and all my books with me to class. It holds a charge for at least 2-3 days of active homework use and general internet fun for me. It starts up almost instantly when I open it! The screen size is fine, and I often have two windows open at the same time, side by side. I've been trying to read more articles online without printing them, and using online textbooks via my Kindle app. After a bit of a learning curve, this has worked out awesome, because if I have my Chromebook, I have ALL my textbooks with me, plus my course information, and my notebook to write things down. I love it. Plus, it doesn't get hot or make a whirring sound when you use it for a long time. I like that because I often use mine while I"m sitting on the couch.<br/><br/>Getting used to using the Chromebook had some hiccups. First, I recommend using Google Docs for writing because it has an offline mode. The Windows OneDrive and cloud version of Word works ok, but if your internet has any interruption, you can't keep typing. That's annoying. So use Google Docs, and don't worry about it! (But if you're working on a project with someone, and they use Word on a Windows laptop, you can collaborate with them no problem using the cloud version of Word.) Second, organizing my files confused me, until I realized that "Save As" is now "Move to folder.' Also, you can download a few files to your Chromebook, so if you need to upload an attachment to Blackboard, you can pretty easily. You'll use your Google Drive for much of your file storage. I did connect my OneDrive to my Chromebook, but it's through a third party app thing, and the connection always has to be redone, so I don't really rely on that, and I plan to move my OneDrive stuff to my Google drive soon.<br/><br/>The only thing that was really hard was setting up my Chromebook to print to my WiFi printer. Google cloud print is in beta, and in theory, it's awesome. When you're done setting it up, you could print to your home printer from anywhere, using your mobile device. However, Google your printer and how to set up cloud print, and give yourself some time to set it up. If you're in a rush, you should just plug your printer into your Chromebook.<br/><br/>Lastly, since many public schools are going Chromebook, I thought it was a good idea to get one myself. I'm working on getting my Master of Arts in Teaching to be an elementary/middle school teacher. Using one for my own schoolwork helps me be able to help students use their Chromebooks. Additionally, the price is so nice, I don't worry about having to ever replace my Chromebook, because if it was damaged by schoolchildren, I'd only be out about $160 (instead of $2000 for a Mac). I'm even thinking of getting one for my mom, since most of what she does online could be done on a Chromebook, too.<br/><br/>Oh, and one very last thing, the keyboard is really enjoyable to type on. The keys are spaced comfortably, and the individual keys make a nice clicky sound, are springy, and are nice and thin, for fast typing. I know that might sound weird, but I'm picky about my keyboards.
I bought my Acer Chromebook at target (I needed it that day) and I love it! A couple of tips for people buying one, though... Take the sticker on the lower right corner off when you get it. The black ink on the sticker started wiping off on the borders around my screen. Also, buy the keyboard cover!! It fits like a glove and I like typing with it a lot more. The keys on this computer are raised off the machine just enough for tiny pieces of dirt or crumbs or anything to get under it and affect the keys. I got the black rubber keyboard cover and i can barely even tell it's on. On a different note, I truly love this computer. I'm a junior in highschool and it's perfect for me to be able to take to and from school and the google drive space is wonderful for all of the group projects I do in my AP courses. It took me about two weeks to get the hang of using chrome OS but the online chat that you can do with chrome support is always super helpful (even for little stuff like not knowing how to delete a program). This machine runs faster than my i3 HP pavilion laptop. On a side note, PLEASE buy yourself a skin or one of those plastic covers because this machine gets scratched pretty easily - especially if you're taking it everywhere with you like I do. LOVE the computer, though!
If I could leave 0 stars, I would. I ordered one of these, opened the cover and there was an error message on the screen:<br/>"Chrome OS is missing or damaged. Please insert a recovery USB stick or sd card." I returned the faulty one and ordered another, whereupon I opened the cover and got the same error message.
I'm no longer a stranger to the Chrome OS, having purchased the Samsung 11.6" Chromebook over a year ago as suport for Windows XP was to be discontinued.<br/><br/>http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009LL9VDG/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_S_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid;=1OIWXLPUL2H3V&coliid;=IC9ZR3JPUKPB8&psc;=1<br/><br/>But that's now an older model; 2012 they say, so when it came time to buy a computer for a young friend I decided to take a look at newer, fresher offerings.  The Acer was getting great reviews, and is/was one of the very best sellers in the category.  With an attractive price even lower than the older Samsung it seemed like a no-brainer to go with the Acer.<br/><br/>As mentioned, it is intended as a gift, so upon arrival I at least wanted to open it up, connect to the internet, and be certain that everything was in working order.  For the few minutes I had it on I could confirm that the computer was attractive (in white), looked to be well built, and that the speakers and display were both better than the older, more expensive Samsung.  I think I prefer the keyboard of the Samsung, but that might be because of familiarity.  Besides, unless I'm travelling, the Samsung is docked on the desk and I'm using a full-size desktop keyboard.<br/><br/>In summary, I like the Acer in overall terms, and if buying a new Chromebook today it would be my choice.<br/><br/>About Chrome:<br/><br/>May not be for everyone.  Doesn't do it all, but many reviewers say it covers 95% of their needs and that fees about right.  The OS updates automatically, and since nothing downloads there's little worry over viruses.  The computer sprints from website to website.  Starts up within seconds.  Battery lasts all day.  So, so much faster than the old Windows experience.  I definitely would not go back.<br/><br/>The downsides and limitations of Chrome that I have found are that you cannot print with a normal, plug-in, USB printer.  The printer needs to be Google approved, cloud ready wireless printer.  Or, as I do, you can have a conventional computer connected to your network, and print through that.  I kept an old Lenovo netbook with Windows XP solely for that purpose.  Also, you cannot use Skype with Chrome and that is disappointing.
Bought this exact model with a manufacturing date of 8/24/2014, and right out of the box I could not connect to my Linksys wireless router.  Router was configured for WPA2 security and SSID was five letters all CAPITAL LETTER.  I did two things to make Wifi connect.  I had to use another laptop to modify the setup info on my router.  Two changes were required.  ONE) Disabled wireless security mode, so WiFi was "open access"  TWO) set SSID (wireless network name) to five letters all lower case.  After these two changes Chromebook connected to open wireless network and performed UPDATES.  Did shutdown and start a few times on Chromebook to make sure that all updates were completed.  Re-configured wireless router to a secure network, and Chromebook was able to connect to WPA2 Personal network.  So far am loving the Acer Chromebook.  It is light, and has great battery life.  Owned it only two days, but so far it is successful at HULU PLUS, NETFLIX, YOUTUBE, browsing internet.  I like it so far!
The screen cracked and we only had it 5 days.
I've always wanted a laptop of my own. Using everyone else's bothered me. So recently, I purchased me a Acer Chromebook. This laptop is AWESOME. Yes, it's not formatted like ANY OTHER computer... but the purchase is worth it. You can still surf the web, play flash games, download a lot of music, take pictures and video chat on Hangouts. In the beginning, I was skeptical about how this little machine would get the job done. I WAS WRONG! Everything runs through Google! There isn't any Facetime or Oovoo... it's just a basic computer. But I love it! And it's so beautiful. '
Absolutely stunned at the quality and the functionality of this Chromebook.  I have been theorizing the possibility of creating my own mobile work environment using this Chromebook and a few of the Google services.  I didn't think it would work so well with a $200 machine, but I was wrong!<br/><br/>Chrome Remote Desktop works like a charm.  I can easily access my main machine from ANYWHERE.  It's very responsive and the screen resolution is better than acceptable for any emulator.<br/><br/>Then, I have linked my office number to my Google Voice number.  All office calls will be automatically forwarded to my Google Voice, which I access via my Chromebook.  I can have a few outgoing msgs that can be activated based on the different circumstances.  I do not need a separate headsets as the built-in speaker and the microphone are fantastic for all type of phone conversations in any setting (in/outdoor).  All rejected and missed calls will be routed to the Google Voice inbox, which converts the voice msg into text and sends the text and voice file to my email inbox (Gmail).  So, I can either read or listen to the msg or forward it to my team members.  Team members do not have to have ANY of this Google set up as the msg is fully contained within the body of the email itself.<br/><br/>All MS Office files I use have been converted  to Google Doc or Sheets file.  The offline function works well and it re-syncs the files the moment I get connected online.  Sharing the file is very simple as well.  Security and access management is very straightforward.<br/><br/>I am COMPLETELY MOBILE with an 11 inch Chromebook.  No computer bags, no office phone.  All is packed in a small Chromebook!  It works VERY VERY well and for VERY long time (I can easily get 9+ hours of work usage on a single charge: no Netflix).<br/><br/>By the way, this Chromebook has no fan and it stays cool.  The touchpad is large and responsive.  It is clearly optimized for productivity and simplicity.<br/><br/>A possible drawback is that the keyboard does not light up, so you will need a little reading light if you need to use in the dark.  The battery is inside the casing so it cannot be removed (easily).<br/><br/>Highly recommended.
I recently had one of my net-books go down and needed just a basic computer to use for everyday use. This little guy is perfect for just basic use.  It would probably be even good for students for just basic stuff. Chromebook is perfect for surfing, movies, streaming, and just recreational use. For the price it is perfect.  I'm so sick of Windows based computers and their constant updating and slow movement... this thing just works. For a couple hundred bucks you can't beat it.  HD screen is very nice and this is actually one of the best small laptops I've ever owned without dropping a grand on a Macbook... very nice.
Adding my review from my Chromebook.<br/><br/>Honestly I was torn between a laptop and a Chromebook.  I needed in the under $200 price range and I needed portability.  I use google all the time for most all my business and home needs even on my desktop PC.  However I was leery of not having a cd drive and internal memory.<br/>Long story short I found a laptop for under $200 and this at this great price. I bought both.<br/>A few days after purchase I broke out the laptop first and set it up.  Set up took forever, windows 8 wasn't playing nice, etc.  Finally set up and I jumped on my google drive to create a syllabus for my Science class I am teaching this fall.  The crazy laptop would NOT stay connected to the WiFi it was SUPER slow to respond, and it took me hours to get anything done, even after spending much time deleting apps, etc.  I realized it was a super cheap laptop, but still, even my OLD (8 year old) laptop gave a better performance than the new one.  Also the laptop battery was dead in 3 to 4 hours even on super saver settings.<br/>Fast forward a few hours I grabbed this Chromebook and opened it up.  I was up and running in MINUTES, typed in my google identity and VOILA there I was, all my bookmarks, history, etc.  Went to drive and had a little bit of a problem while trying to edit my document...saw an update icon in the corner, clicked it, updated the Chrome OS and VOILA no more problems.  I was on the Chromebook for over 8 hours with no charge and still had plenty of battery left.  I set up accounts for my entire family, my business and school.  It starts up and wakes up super quickly, I had no problems working with documents from word after google found the right extension for me, it hits my WiFi and stays connected no matter where I go, it is light weight but still feels sturdy and tough.  I need another portable laptop or chromebook for my son to carry on his class days this fall.  I am thinking we will be purchasing another chromebook and just saving any PC stuff we need done for the desktop.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>Affordable, quick, sturdy, lightweight, fast, easy to use and set up, familiar Chrome system, can work on or offline with most Chrome programs now, LONG LONG battery life<br/>Cons<br/>no number pad, no internal storage to speak of, no cd drive, does require internet connection more than a laptop.  Not quite as versatile as windows yet but sure is easier to use.<br/>I really didn't think I would like a Chromebook, I was not sold on the idea of not having all my familiar PC stuff.  I WAS WRONG
I bought this laptop as basically a toy. I have a large and powerful desktop I use for graphic design work, and a couple clunky laptops I use and abuse for other purposes. I wanted a new laptop with a long battery and basic functions I could use for flights and while out and about. This one is small enough to fit in my bag, light enough to comfortably bring with me anywhere, and can run almost as long as I can.<br/><br/>Pros: lightweight, silent, and never overheats. I can watch 5-7 hours of video (depending on if it's streaming or not) and still have some juice left. It is efficient enough to not overheat, and even on sticky 90 degree days, have in my lap with no discomfort. I use this heavily for business and work, as well as play, and does all that and more at a very reasonable price.<br/><br/>Cons: While efficient, it is still a Chromebook. Chromium reminds me of a very, very stripped down OS X. While mostly intuitive, a lot of the customization I've grown used to with Linux and the mac OS is lost here. It's not necessary to do what I need it to do, but the personal touch is something I enjoy on every machine I use and miss here. In addition, when stressed, the system can occasionally get bogged down. I found myself with several tabs open on Chrome and trying to use google Docs, and the system slowed to crawl. I didn't have to reboot, simply close out of chrome and reload what I was doing, but it was still a hassle.<br/><br/>Honestly, the biggest drawback to this machine is also it's greatest strength. The inherent and core Google integration means everything I use and access on other machines is instantly at my fingertips. It also means that without an internet connection, you lose almost everything, and when trying to multitask, you run the risk of stressing the machine so heavily that everything is compromised while you try and calm the beast down.<br/><br/>Overall, I love this machine. It does exactly what I need and it does it exceptionally well. (Don't let the cons scare you away, I just tried to find every nit-picky detail. I hate reviews that leave a high rating with no potential pitfalls.) Don't buy this computer expecting an incredibly powerful device. Rather, spend the money and get an excellent toy and tool.
I've tried them all. HP. Dell. Apple. And I've always been monumentally disappointed. Sure, they work great for a bit, but then, like always, they get slow, they start losing functionality. They are all but dead and another few hundred dollars are gone.<br/><br/>And then I bought a Chromebook.<br/><br/>Let me be clear, I don't just browse. I bought my Chromebook for graduate school, and everytime, the Chromebook has exceeded the expectations I set for it. I typed my papers (including my thesis) on this trusty little notebook without ever worrying if it saved, if I could access it, anything.<br/><br/>That's because the Chromebook is designed for busy folks on the go. My Chromebook can go from completely off, to me surfing the web, in about 10-15 seconds. My work is saved to Google Drive and updates as I go. My calendar, my email, my quick notes, everything, is available to me anywhere.<br/><br/>Let's be clear, you have to sign your life over to Google for this to be worth your while. Get an Android phone. Use Google Calendar, use Gmail, use Hangouts, use Google Docs, use Google Keep, use Google Photos. If you're willing to do that, then the Chromebook can serve as your hub for all things Google.<br/><br/>Instead of getting slower, my Chromebook has gotten faster the more I use it. It's like it anticipates my moves. The typing interface is smooth (very similar to Apple). I love the tracking pad that doesn't require "clicks" but just taps. It has an HDMI hookup (I used it to watch March Madness on my TV), two USB ports, and an SD card slot.<br/><br/>This is rambling but it's because I can't say enough good things about the Chromebook. If for some reason this bites it, then I will absolutely buy a new one. Quit playing around with the expensive Apples, the unreliable HPs, the slow Dells. This is what you need.
I didn't buy this computer from Amazon as I had a gift card to a large electronic store... But regardless of where it came from, what is important is that I absolutely do not regret my purchase and would have bought it from anywhere! I have had it for a little less than a month and I use it every single day. I also have an Ultrabook (HP Dv4) which is great, but I accidentally cracked the screen (it still works) and have been scared to take it around with me places for fear of damaging it even further. My goal for buying a Chromebook was to have something cheap as a backup that I could take with me and use if I needed it at school or work. But I have found that I haven't even logged onto my Ultrabook since I bought this Chromebook!! I would have never believed I would use this Chromebook at home when I have a perfectly functioning laptop. Why? Several reasons:<br/><br/>1) The connection to the internet is so fast. At home, it is instantly connected and boots up in the blink of an eye. At my university, there is special software you have to log into when you connect, which is bypassed with this Chromebook since it does not have the ability to download external software. The OS remembers the network and automatically connects me. Every once in a while it makes me sign in on the website (just like it would a phone), but normally I'm connected within five seconds of opening my computer. More than I can say for my laptop.<br/><br/>2) Google Docs. Need I say more? Automatically saving to the cloud, I never have to worry about losing a document! And it's so easy to use. Sure it's not fully loaded with all of the features of Microsoft Office, but you can do the same basic things (spreadsheets, documents, presentations) for absolutely free. Worth it right there. Also, the ability to share right on the screen with someone else is really convenient for group work. And you can use Google Docs even without the internet, it just doesn't upload to the cloud until you are connected to wifi.<br/><br/>3) It's SO lightweight. Seriously. Even with the hard snap on case that I bought for it, it weighs next to nothing. I bought a small messenger bag for it which I carry my computer and external hard drive in and it's lighter than my purse. It's really easy to take literally everywhere. I love to write, so wherever the mood strikes me, I can open it and write.<br/><br/>4) I said this before, but it deserves another mention: You can still use Google Docs without the internet!! This by itself is what sold me. I love writing and I was concerned about a computer that only operates with wifi since I'm not always around an internet connection. But you can still write till your heart's content, you just can't save it to the cloud until you hit a wifi area. I love this feature. I can still type up papers or a story or whatever and either save it on the computer until I can get to internet, or I'll just save it on my external hard-drive which I always bring with me.<br/><br/>5) USB ports for flashdrives and external hard drives. Connects so easily, and gives you an extended amount of space without having to compromise your (Very very very) small hard-drive.<br/><br/>6) It's stylish. It's white with black keys and I have a red cover for it that snaps on. I get compliments all the time. People assume it's a Macbook from far away because it is so sleek. Not that it's a huge reason to buy something, but aesthetics can be important, especially if you are a business/academic professional.<br/><br/>7) It's just $199. I mean, really. Can you beat that??? Sure you can't play video games on it or do photoshop... but for the average internet use and basic documents/spreadsheets... it's an insane deal. Phones cost more than this!!<br/><br/>8) Battery life. I have this thing unplugged more than plugged and it's amazing! Sometimes I even lose my charger because I can't remember where I put it the last time I used it, which is typically days in between. The battery life is over 8 hours of continuous use, which for me would be able three days in between needing charged.<br/><br/>9) It opens almost 180 degrees. This may seem silly, but when you are laying in bed and you are propping it up on your knees, it's amazing to be able to have it almost flat so that you can type and see the screen at the same time. I love this feature because I'm usually in bed writing after my husband and daughter are asleep.<br/><br/>10) The trackpad is the easiest trackpad I've ever used. It is really responsive and scrolls like a breeze. Clicking on things was super easy to figure out, more so than my Ultrabook, which after 2 years I'm still not quite sure how to use. In fact, all of the features on it were pretty easy to figure out without reading the manual. It is definitely an out of the box and use type of computer, which I love. Anyone can figure it out, no matter how technologically disinclined you are! :)<br/><br/>There are a few very small cons:<br/><br/>1) Some wifi connections won't connect. I suspect this is the sign in screen not being prompted. It has only happened in one place, and I'm going to research it further but it's not a huge hindrance since if I can't use the internet on here I'll just use my phone. I really use this for writing when I'm out and about since I have data on my phone. Not a deal breaker.<br/><br/>2) There is no caps lock button. I'm not a hardcore caps lock typer, but sometimes I'd like to be able to type in caps lock without having to hold shift. Instead of the caps lock button it's the search button, which I inadvertently hit all the time... I literally just hit it when trying to type the word all, because sometimes I am a type-screamer for emphasis. :/<br/><br/>That's all I can think of now. I really really love this computer. It is the best $199 I have ever spent!
My family has gone through a few Chromebooks, and this one is the best so far. It seems to have the sturdiest frame and keyboard. It has enough memory and processing power to handle all of our web activities, including watching movies and video chatting, as well as a lot of office work on Google Drive and sometimes Microsoft OneDrive.  We still keep a Windows computer for some software like Rosetta Stone and to use the full Word program for heavily formatted Word files (which we usually create in Google first and use Word to ensure the formatting is correct). The 11" model is a good size. I have big hands and it still works fine for me. For longer typing sessions I will sometimes attach a standard keyboard to the USB port. I recommend it for the kids (with the warning that it won't run Minecraft) because it's inexpensive and they can't infect it with viruses or screw up the software and if they do it can be factory reset in a few moments. At first I didn't want a white computer and almost decided against it; however, it's turned out to be a big benefit because white makes it easy to spot. This is an important feature, because it's the go-to and carry-around device that we all share, so it's kind of like the TV remote control in that it could be anywhere. Overall, this is a good deal and ACER is the best of the Chromebook makers even if there are a few better brand names that are generally better with other computers. Maybe the biggest benefit of Chromebooks in general for our family is that it protects our more expensive (and still very necessary and quite vulnerable) Windows machine safe from our rough children and malware.<br/><br/>Update: 6/19/15 - Seven Months Ownership<br/><br/>It's still holding up with no troubles and being quite productive.
I've had it a month now, and I like everything about the Acer Chromebook.  It took a minute to get used to the touchpad's two-finger scrolling, and for certain things like highlighting text or spreadsheet cells for copying, I plug in a USB mouse.  I can do everything I need to do on the chromebook except upload pictures from my camera.  I'd already committed to Google Drive for storing and editing files, so there was no transition pain.  Battery life is a pleasant surprise on this Acer--it really is as advertised, if you shut down when you aren't using it.  (Push the on/off button for a second, then click on "shut down".  Obviously, you can't be in the middle of something if you're going to do this.)  If you leave it on standby (by simply closing the lid), the battery drains slowly the whole time.  Chromebooks come up so quickly it's not even inconvenient to do a full startup--it takes a few seconds.  It charges quickly too, albeit from a mini-brick charger twice as big as a typical phone charger.  The keyboard is fine, though I miss a dedicated delete key, and the top row has all the important net-navigating actions right there  (back, forward, reload) as well as mute, volume up, volume down, brightness up, brightness down.  It's very light and seems to pick up wi-fi signals well.  Be advised that it may tell you it isn't connected even though it is.  It comes up with your pages pretty quickly, although presumably to save power and bandwidth I notice that it usually waits until you open a tab for the first time before it loads the page.  That's fine with me.  The screen is quite readable, really very nice.  At this price, this device is a steal.
At this price, there is simply no reason not to buy a Chromebook. But only if you have or are willing to become a Google "Chrombot". I made that up. But it's true. You will love this especially if you love having your Android phone, tablet, PC all synced together. Going to one from the other is seamless.<br/>The CB3-111 is easy to use. Ridiculously easy. Turn it on and it is on. Sign into your Google account and that is it. As with every new device there is a small learning curve. Read the manual or watch a Youtube video about it. Within a day or two, you will find yourself fully functional. So it's easy and it's fast. I am sure you can get the 2 meg of ram to slow down with lot's of games and open applications. But not yet. I use it for email and reading. It's perfect. And it is as light as a pin - very easy on the lap, silent running - very convenient to carry anywhere just like a tablet. But unlike tablets, it has a great keyboard for those who remember how to type and enjoy writing. Do I miss a touch screen? Not really. Essentially, This is the "Netbook" we were all looking for, but were frustrated with. Tablets came along and stole their thunder. And the netbooks of old were sluggish and had all the frustrations that comes along with clunky under powered, bloated pcs. The CB3-111 is an incredible value and fun to use.<br/><br/>update after 23 days of continuous use:<br/>battery life is terrific - never needs charging mid-day - just plug it in each night<br/>matte screen is helpful in bright light, but poor side viewing (sharing a photo with someone) is limiting<br/>it is quick - for the price it is very quick<br/>the syncing between this and the phone and big pc is seamless<br/>I love this little machine more and more
Works perfectly and its the perfect little laptop.  It's fast and I wish I had it during my undergrad years.<br/><br/>Those of you that didn't do their research before purchasing and gave bad scores are pretty dumb and the only thing that should get a bad score is yourself.  Who in their right mind would purchase a laptop without research?!?<br/><br/>Keep in mind that this is a chromebook.  It runs on the google operating system and uses google products for everything.  Microsoft Office programs are still useable but only if you have internet connection.  Google office programs like docs, can be used offline but must be online to be converted to microsoft format.  This is perfect if you are using this for college.  This is the perfect laptop for taking notes and surfing the web.<br/><br/>Last but not least, the battery is godly.  I think google found a way to create infinite energy because this thing just doesnt run out.  I took it to my four hour class and when I got home I surfed the web on the couch and watched youtube videos and this thing was at 25% after several hours of doing that.  I almost feel guilty charging it at night sometimes cause its usually at 90% or above when I'm done using it.
Exceeded my expectations, and I am very happy. The chrome web store has a lot of web based apps, including ones I did not expect. Some such as: a video downloader, screen recorder, microsoft word & powerpoint, spotify, and more.<br/><br/>Keyboard, screen, and webcam actually look and feel like good quality to me, although obviously not top of the line. While it might not be preferred, this means that netflix actually looks good and I can enjoy a movie or show on it. This is coming from a former 2011 macbook user.<br/><br/>The speed is surprising and I don't feel feel pinched at all.<br/><br/>Biggest con for me is no skype.<br/><br/>Edit: After using the device over fifty hours I am still very satisfied. One thing that I have discovered that is not so good is that while streaming music, or listening to music that is downloaded, there are certain cues that cause the track to skip. For example, the "Apps" button on the bottom left corner of the screen, that is also cued by the magnifying class key, always causes a slight skip. Not such a big deal for me but I thought some people might like to know.
Amazing. It's lightweight, fast and really easy to use. But, only one thing I didn't like. You can't download anything from the internet. Only the chrome app store. So no Minecraft, no Steam, none of that.
Hello. I bought this little computer and I really like it, but if you are going to buy there are some things you need to know. First of all you cannot print from this computer unless you have a printer that can connect to the internet. Also if you have an iPhone and access iTunes for your music you will not like this computer. iTunes does not yet have a software available for Chromebook so you will be unable to install it on your Chromebook. I cannot stand Windows 8 and I love google but you cannot access anything without using google in some way. This computer is very good for what I need which is mainly for school. And for the price its pretty great! The computer is very lightweight and easy to use. If you want access to the internet to watch netflix or do homework this computer is awesome. If you want a computer for storing pictures, downloading music etc. do not buy. Altogether this Chromebook suits my needs but I find those two items to be slightly annoying!
Great purchase. Needed a lightweight computer for classes mostly just to view online documents slides.  Works perfectly for that purpose.  The battery life is insanely great, can go for close to ten hours while streaming music.  Powerful enough to view online virtual microscopy slides that exceed 40 GB and still surf the web and stream music at the same time.  The sound comes out the bottom of the chromebook so it is most ideal for listen when the device is resting on a hard surface.  Sound quality is significantly better than my HP dm4 laptop.  Connectivity is as good as advertised, haven't tried the hdmi port yet to see how that is.  Bluetooth works well for music.  Overall, well worth the $199 I paid.
One I got was defective - or at least I hope this was restricted to the one I bought and not reflective of this product in general. Touchpad was not consistently responsive - seemed like it worked only on the outer edges but if I ran my finger through the middle, it wouldn't move.<br/><br/>Seemed like a half-assed production job as the sticker on the lower right portion (advertising sticker for how much memory it had) was not even put on right and was crooked. There were also tiny scratch/stress marks on the space bar suggesting this unit was either put together hastily or taken apart previously.<br/><br/>Returned the one I received, will update upon receipt of replacement.
It is limited but so am I. I can check the internet, get the news, find historical information, check on my $, email whomever if I have their address, read articles/books, etc. I can also order stuff such as another Chromebook.<br/><br/>Interesting device. Do I understand much about it? No, but I have not understood much in the electronics world since I left the Navy as an ET1 and proceeded to go to college with a major in English and History. Have I missed electronics much? No, circuits are not as exciting as the French Revolution.<br/><br/>It does work well and I appreciate having it.<br/><br/>Harold E Holcombe, PhD

If you can't stand Windows and want something more secure, faster and more stable, then this Chromebook is the one for you.<br/>The processor is good enough and the 2 GB of RAM are OK for most tasks. However, if you want more speed and the ability<br/>to open many many tabs then a Corei3 or the Nivida Tegra K-1 along with 4 GB of RAM is perfect.<br/>You also don't need antivirus, no firewall, no registry software, no scandisk, and no defrag.  Chrome OS is all in one.
I bought this chromebook a year ago, and I have been very pleased.  I was hesitant to leave the comfort of Windows, but I was finished with having laptops freeze up on me or have internal hard drives fail, and I was ready for something that was fast and reliable, and able to handle my very basic needs.<br/><br/>I can navigate several tabs at the same time. I have tested it's capacity by streaming Watch ESPN, Youtube and Pandora. There was some lag with all 3 running, but that was expected. I was shocked that I could do all 3 on this machine, as I could hardly do one on my previous PC. I cant think of a valid reason I would have 3 streaming services like that running at once, and this machine handles one at a time with no impact to other tasks (email, browsing, Docs, Sheets...)<br/><br/>The biggest hurdles for me:<br/>- My printer is not cloud enabled, so I had to keep my windows computer running and connected both to the internet and the printer. Sometimes this was a hassle, making sure everything was on and connected just to print a sheet. This was a known obstacle, but I just wanted to include it for anyone who may not have thought about it prior to purchasing.<br/>- Google Sheets is okay for very, very basic spreadsheets. However, I've found it difficult to do pivot tables (it is possible, but it's just a very different format).  The loss of Microsoft Office was the hardest part of the transition. Google Docs is fantastic, and I haven't found any functionality that I need that is not readily and clearly available. Slides and Sheets are clearly lower versions than what MS offers on dedicated software, but they are free and functional. Again, this was a known obstacle.<br/><br/>I've thoroughly enjoyed this chromebbok. It's ultra portable. It's responsive. It's effective at doing everything that I need out of a laptop. I don't do video or photograph editing, gaming, or anything else that requires a high performing PC.  But for my needs, I couldnt have asked for more.
I'd not ever tried Chromebooks before.  I usually work on mac and windows.  I decided to try this out and the price seemed too good to be true.  Of course the other reviews are mostly incredible so it made sense to give it a go.  I have to say I'm converted.  The laptop is light, easy to use and chrome is really worth checking out and taking a little time to get used to.  I had also considered the 15 inch version and tried it, but surprisingly preferred this smaller screen.  The 15 is beautiful and basically a bigger version of this with a great screen, but there's something impressive about this little machine that needs to be experienced to be appreciated.<br/><br/>The typing is incredible, the keyboard has no 'bounce' and the screen - while its not hd - is really clear and bright.  The sound is surprisingly great too and perfect for me to listen to youtube / music.<br/><br/>Battery was something I really hoped was as good as stated and mine is.  I get more time on this than any other device I've used like this.<br/><br/>The fast on/off is really cool.  I had heard Chromebooks were like this but coming to chrome OS for the first time was really cool to experience.<br/><br/>Of course you're not going to be doing Photoshop or photo editing on this but for a perfect on the go computer this takes some beating.  I use OneDrive and you can pin that to the shelf (cool idea) like all other websites/apps and I find it really easy to use.  Google drive I assume does the same thing... haven't tried it yet.  All in all I'm enjoying experiencing Chrome OS for the first time.<br/><br/>In conclusion I'd recommend this to anyone of my friends as a truly great computer and one of the few I've tried this last year that really give value for money.  If you're on the fence I'd say definitely give it a go.  If you understand its not a machine for doing Pshop, picture or video editing, but want a fast, light and highly useful laptop for using on the go and want to begin learning Chrome OS its perfect.
I love this thing. Back when chromebooks were initially being released, I thought they were the dumbest thing ever. They don't allow for MS Office and other programs that I need to use pretty often, so that was a turn off. However, as Google Drive/Docs has developed throughout the years, I've been able to be nearly as productive without needing those programs. So, I had a change of heart about the usefulness of Chromebooks, and besides, 95% of the time I spend on a computer is on the internet, as is the case with the majority of people.<br/><br/>When I saw this on sale for only $150, I decided to give it a go after reading reviews, and it's the best purchase I've made all year. The battery life is amazing. It's fast and can surprisingly handle my heavy usage very well most of the time (I'm one of those people with 20 tabs open at once all the time). I never turn it off, so whenever I open this up it is immediately ready to go. It hasn't shown any signs of slowing down, and with the Chrome OS, I don't expect it to. The speakers on this are also ridiculously good for the price. I was not expecting that at all, but they've blown me away. I'm a musician, and I'm really picky about quality of speakers, but these are absolutely awesome.<br/><br/>Guys and gals, do not look any further - go ahead and buy this. A few months after buying this for only $150, BestBuy had it for $130 and I bought it (FYI, Amazon price matches computers). I ended up taking it back because I had convinced myself to buy the HP Stream 11 and giving my mom this Acer CB3 Chromebook, but ended up not buying it afterward because of the nightmare of dealing with Windows 8, but mostly because all of my Windows computers have gradually slowed over time. Taking back my second purchase of this device was the biggest mistake I've made in a long time. I should've kept it and given it to my mom because it was a steal at that price (and it still is even right now). The Acer CB2 is perfect for the average consumers computer needs.
This is my experience with my new Acer CB3-111 Chromebook so far. I have used Google for mail, blog and sites, so the Chromebook is not as alien as it might be to those unfamiliar with Google’s quirks. I feel that using gmail on line and using Google docs for the first few times is similar to upgrading Microsoft windows. I know what I want to do, but doing it is just a little different than the last version I used. I have had 6 tabs open in the browser and had no sense of the machine slowing down. UTUBE works well. The SD slot does not swallow the entire card as a bigger laptop does, so I understand how others do not like having the card sticking halfway out of the machine, but then I do not roam around with the card in the machine. The flash drive worked just like it would on windows. I downloaded a PDF file and that was handled well. Pictures can now be inserted directly into an email instead of sent as an attachment I prefer inserting them directly into the message. The initial device configuration hung up, but it seemed to be an online glitch so I turned the machine off for 20 seconds and turned it back on and everything was completed right away. I registered the Chromebook on Acer’s website and as soon as they accepted the serial number the screen changed and there was a link to download the full 40 page user manual, which I highly recommend doing. The manual is available on the Acer site, but I needed to look around for a while to find it before I registered the Chromebook. The keyboard is 10.5 inches across  just shy of the 11 inch one on my 17” Acer laptop, and it works well. I was using the machine off and on for 2 days and leaving it on standby in between usage. I monitored the battery status during that time and I think it did last through about 8.5 hours of use, plus the standby. It recharged from 5% to 100% in less than 1 and a half hours. This machine has no fan, but after hours of use it was still quite cool to touch. The speakers are on the bottom, but have more than enough volume when it is sitting on a table. Most people use headphones anyway as they are better than any laptop speakers. Because I have previously had Google accounts, when I signed in the first time all of my Google bookmarks, and everything else Google started showing up so that saved a lot of grief with transferring files and such. If I completely shut off the Chromebook I need to log back into Google, otherwise, from standby that is not necessary. I can just use the Chromebook as a guest and that does not require any login. I have used this thing day and night  for the last 5 days and have yet to find anything it will not do well. One day I had the Chromebook and my windows laptop side by side during an agonizing tech support session with my web hosting company. The Chromebook had been in use for about 4 hours prior and when I turned the windows laptop on it went through 100% battery in 2.5 hours, but the Chromebook was still running fine on its battery and lasted another hour plus. One thing I learned from the Acer chromebook manual was how to do a right click. It is simple, just tap the trackpad with two fingers for a quick half second. The dialogue box will open with options as it does in Windows machines. If I hold that too long the Chromebook thinks I want to move the screen up or down. I cannot speak much for games beyond a card game I play. My thinking is get a tablet for playing games, they are better with a touch screen. You never lose an email with Google until you choose to dump it. That can be years on just a free 15 gigabyte storage. I opened Google drive and using it with the Chromebook it runs faster than with a windows machine. I do not know why, but I had quit using it with windows because it took so long to up or download. My windows computer takes 2 minutes to come out of sleep mode and be ready to use. It takes almost 4 minutes from a shut down. This Chromebook is ready to work in about 5 seconds. That is big for me because I want to jump on line for just a few seconds at times. I have been using this Chromebook for 1 week now and I have not found anything it will not do. I am sure I will at some point, but not yet. After 1 week I can understand why some people have said when they bought a Chromebook as a secondary or backup unit, they now use it as the primary computer. If you have read this far and know of things windows will do that Chromebook will not, you apparently use windows for things I never have. I think for 90 or more % of users this Acer Chromebook CB3-111-C670 will do everything you want to do. I am dragging this thing all around the house and the WIFI works well for me.
Always on a budget and my dell $300 laptop (the cheapest I could find years ago) loses races to snails on crutches.  Found a one day deal for $125 (even that is tight for me) and I AM THRILLED WITH THIS CHROMEBOOK!<br/>1. Instant Boot Up (3 seconds most)<br/>2. Does almost everything I need (which is not much, just the internet)<br/>3. LIGHT<br/>4. The battery REALLY LAST ALL DAY<br/>BEATS MY DELL LAPTOP (but anything would)<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>all quirky WHY DID GOOGLE DO THAT?<br/>1. It really pushes apps. Like other APPS I am tired of trying out 10 or more youtube apps, just to find the browser (chrome of course) works just fine.<br/>2. There is a big empty desktop for your background pic, but you cant's put apps, shortcuts or anything on the desktop (just the bottom line)<br/>3. I prefer firefox in general over chrome ... but small price to pay to make the effort to switch to chrome<br/>4. ONLY 1 USB port hmmmm<br/>3. TWO (I think) HDMI ports : regular and I think a "mini" (not micro) by the power plug<br/>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  BUT IF YOU GET CHROMECAST FOR $29 you never need to deal with any HDMI cords at all.<br/>4. Like the entire current state of Clouds and info gathering, EVERTHING seemes to get loaded to various places - so if you wanna see racy pics of my dog sleeping on the bed .... there are probably a dozen places you could find it.  I never tried to save any.  I have no life or info anyone would care about<br/>5. THE WHITE LOOKS GREAT! But come on - it will get grimy looking in a short while.<br/>6. Would it be that difficult or costly to have a CAPS LOCK key???  really? You can remember on of hundreds of key combos for countless keyboard shortcuts .... I don't bother.<br/><br/>SUM<br/>forget all my negatives<br/>if you are on a budget (or for kids) IT IS MORE THAN A STEAL.  So far ... a month or two.<br/><br/>(and btw this appllies to 99% of new electronics ... but such a light notebook with a power cord and adapter that probably weighs as much as the laptop itself.  still .... what you gonna do?  :)
If I'd known how awesome Chromebooks were, I would have never bought a horrible Dell netbook. Brand new out of the box my Netbook was snail slow and a disaster to navigate. This baby is lightning fast and has just about everything you could possibly need.<br/><br/>For those who are also new to Chromebooks, you could think of it as a Google tablet, but with the attached keyboard like your typical laptop. It runs entirely on Google software, so no Windows! This may limit some of your software interests, but again you can't exactly think of this as a laptop. It's designed to run lightning fast, access the internet, your basic apps, send e-mail, edit documents, and that's about it. There's not a lot of hard drive space, but Google provides 100gb of free Google Drive storage so it's really no big deal.<br/><br/>As someone who writes a lot of reviews, edits a lot of documents and writes essays for school, this is EXACTLY what I need. A no-nonsense, spyware free, unnecessary programs free, computer that has a full-sized keyboard attached. I can access the internet on it faster than I can on my desktop. It's unbelievable.<br/><br/>The current Amazon price is $179 which I think is an absolute steal. I paid $300 for a Dell netbook which, like I say, was worthless right out of the box. If awkward typing on tablets is a problem for you, this is your answer. It's crazy slim, super accessible, lightning fast, and void of all the junk that Windows lapbooks and netbooks are loaded with. I'm so happy, I can't stop talking about it. Highly, highly recommended!
This is the best chromebook at any price. Light and beautiful. It is fast and quick to respond. I have owned many chromebooks but this tops anyone I've owned or used.
I did not think it was possible to buy a laptop for $159, let alone a good one. I was also leery about the Chrome OS since all I've ever used was Windows, but wow. I mean wow do I love this.<br/><br/>I needed something light and basic (email, Facebook, documents etc.) and I needed it on the cheap. This Chromebook arrived the day after I ordered it and there was absolutely no setup required. I've used Chrome as my browser for years, so there was no learning curve there at all. I had't realized how much of my laptop use is online now anyway, I barely noticed that I was using a non Windows OS. Google Docs is every bit as functional (and intuitive) as Word, and the rest of the Google apps have more than met my other needs.<br/><br/>Oh and the battery life. Seriously amazing. I forgot what it was like not to have to haul a charger with me. I can use this all day and still have power. This isn't going to be the best laptop if you are concerned about viewing angles since the screen is only view able from straight ahead, but I actually prefer the privacy that provides me in public. And did I mention the 100 GB of Google Drive storage?<br/><br/>All in all, this laptop is perfect for me.
This is my second Acer Chromebook. The first one being the C720. The biggest improvement on the 11 is with the speakers. The C720 speakers were so low in volume, it was necessary to use earphones at all times. A great inconvenience.  While the speakers on the 11, won't be confused by audiophiles as surround sound, or anything close, they are of decent volume and quality to compare to a good transistor radio of a generation ago. Which is good enough for me considering this computers size.<br/><br/>You still need another computer with a printer, to run Google Cloud Print, as there's no way to directly connect a printer to a Chromebook. I don't do a lot of printing, so it's a minor drawback. As is, you have to send your print jobs to "the cloud" and it in turn sends it to another computer with a connected printer.<br/><br/>There are less ports on the 11, than the C720. Mainly the lack of an ethernet port. The good news is that you can buy an adapter with an ethernet port on one end and a USB plug on the other. Some of us, true or not, still perceive being wired as being better than wi-fi.
I bought this computer over 2 years ago and it was a little difficult to adjust to the operating system, but I have to say I love it and it's a great value. I have dropped it several times, spilled an entire beer over the keyboard, spilled a coffee over the keyboard, I broke the screws on the large bottom panel that covers the guts of the computer and it kept streaming my show with the hard drive swinging below. All the while, I have enjoyed quick startups and pages loading quickly and seamless streaming in HD to my tv. I'm totally impressed, No annoying bloatware, limited simple quick updates, and a really affordable price. I utilize other google products like google docs spreadsheets drive gmail and chromecast, it all works together very easily. (I can't tell you  how much i HATE 30 day trbials of office and Norton and constant reminders to update and accidentally restarting the computer and having to wait 30 minutes for the stupid thing to start up again. stupid)
I really like Chromebooks. They're not complete computers, but they do about 90% of what you need to do at a great price, and they are LOW maintenance. This one has a great combination of features and enough horsepower with the Celeron to have acceptable response. The price is quite low, but you get what you pay for. This brand new laptop was delivered with a loose trackpad that rattles when you touch it. It's too annoying to use. I had to send it back to be fixed. Acer's quality control is not up to the standard of its competitors. I lived through the "netbook" era and went through quality control problems with two Acer netbooks at that time. Looks like things have not changed. Time blunted my memory. I should have remembered not to be blinded by absolute low price.  If this Chromebook is acceptably repaired, then it will still have value, but I fear that it may become a $150 write-off.
1st one we bought, the speakers didn't work. This was the 2nd one,  the touchpad was lose and had intermittent responsiveness.  We returned both. Probably try another brand of Chromebook.
I've had an 16" HP Pavilion dv6 (weighs about 7 lbs) ever since I was in high school and I've finally upgraded to this Chromebook for college, and I am definitely glad that I did! There are a HUGE number of differences between my HP laptop and this Acer Chromebook, but the most notable are the weight, size, battery length, speed, and OS features. So far, my Chromebook is easy to set up, operate, and maneuver, so here's to hoping that it won't let me down in the future!
Let's start with realistic expectations, at $199 this is a fantastic device.<br/>This is my first Chromebook and I am surprised with how intuitive this thing is. The function keys are extremely useful, speakers are much louder and more clear than expected. Display isn't full HD but plenty good for an 11 inch laptop. The look and feel is much higher quality than the price would suggest. Highly recommend for anyone looking into getting a cheap laptop.
I love it! I've had a number of people tell me they don't like the idea of something running on just chome and the laptop is just a web browser, but I've been able to do actual work on this thing; work on MS Office, and save files on dropbox. It's not a primary computer by any means, but it's exactly what I was looking for, and I'm continually impressed with what I can do on it - I'm writing this review on it now. I'm really glad I got it.
but I won't because I don't want to give the impression this is the best thing ever. It is pretty F***ing good, though. It's simple, it allows me to seamlessly use several different apps and websites. I can't get a lot of video streaming though. Such as ******Amazon Instant Video****** or *****Hulu****** to name a couple. I do have Netflix and am happy about that but I really wish the google store would get on this.
This product is amazing. It is a low cost, light weight laptop that does all the things you really need a laptop to do. It has the Chrome browser, and with a gmail account you can create and manage google docs including spreadsheet, word processor and powerpoint-like presentation software.<br/><br/>What I love about it most is that it is NOT microsoft windows based. Hence, it does not take five minutes to boot up. It turns on almost immediately. I love that I did not have to take 3 hours to uninstall a bunch of bloat ware, or try to get worthless pre-installed software off of it. It comes simply with just what you need, and nothing else.<br/><br/>It is extremely thin and light weight. It is perfect for traveling. The screen is bright, and the screen size makes it usable.<br/><br/>I can not describe how good it feels to be free of microsoft and to have a device that is simple, elegant, and just works!
I'll admit to being a bit of a technophile, always on the hunt for a new gadget to play with, but my search for a Chromebook was born of an actual reason. I do a lot of freelance writing and editing in my off-time and I needed something both usable and portable. My laptop (bless its little processor) is a bit of a beast and getting on in years, and its constant lagging is a killer; my iPad mini, while portable and great to use for wasting time on the internet or reading, isn't a feasible writing or editing tool. And so began my foray into the world of Chromebooks. Long story short, taking the plunge with the Acer CB3 was one of the best decisions I've made.<br/><br/>*** PROS:<br/><br/>- Syncs with your Google account (which, duh, it's a CHROMEbook) -- this was perfect for me, as I do all of my writing/editing in Google Docs and Gmail.<br/><br/>- Though it isn't using the familiar interfaces of Windows or OSX, it was very easy to adapt to the Chrome OS. It's a lot closer to Windows 7 than anything, albeit a very stripped-down version.<br/><br/>- Super fast and strong wifi connection. For reference, my bedroom is the furthest point from my living room (on the other side of the apartment, where my router lives) and my iPad Mini's wifi connection is spotty at best in my room (it frequently cuts out altogether). My Chromebook's connection in my room is 100%, all the time.<br/><br/>- Boots up in, like, 20 seconds. My laptop takes about 3 or 4 years to load everything.<br/><br/>- Battery life. It lasts a VERY long time in between charges.<br/><br/>- Matte screen. I think the last non-glossy screen I used was my desktop computer back in the day. It took all of 5 minutes for me to get used to it; my eyes almost wept in joy. Every other glossy screen seems too harsh now.<br/><br/>- Well-designed track pad. It's like a scene out of Goldilocks: not too sensitive, not too dull, but juuust right.<br/><br/>- Very decent speakers. I was quite surprised by how loud and clear the sound is. I was in the living room the other day, watching something on YouTube, and my roommate thought it was the TV.<br/><br/>- The keyboard. I don't know what it is about it, but I adore it. I think it's how quiet it is, maybe.<br/><br/>- Easily customizable settings. From how you want to scroll to using Chrome Extensions, the settings are easy to access, navigate, and implement.<br/><br/>- The weight. Holy cow, this thing is light. Clocking in at 2.4lbs, this thing is like carrying nothing. I thought I was going to snap it in half the day I took it out of the box. Super slim, super light, and (like Mini-Me from Austin Powers) able to fit in small storage spaces (like my purse).<br/><br/>*** CONS (which aren't cons so much as things to get used to):<br/><br/>- No dedicated CAPS LOCK key. Although most Chromebooks don't have one, it's something I've been conditioned to have. There are two ways to achieve that oh-so-necessary yell mode, though: hold Shift down and type, or press Alt+Shift to enable CAPS LOCK mode. Pressing Shift again will revert back to normal mode. (In place of the CAPS LOCK key is a key that launches a search window)<br/><br/>UPDATE: Thanks to user M. Bentley, I've discovered that you can change the function of the CTRL, ALT, and Search keys. In settings under "Device," select "Keyboard Settings" and make your selection from the dropdown menus. My Search key is now permanently CAPS LOCK!<br/><br/>- Keyboard shortcuts. I'm sure I could have just as easily read the manual, but I didn't (who even does that, honestly?), so I floundered a bit until I Googled some tips 'n tricks. Luckily, OMGChrome! already anticipated people like me and had a little guide handy. (http://www.omgchrome.com/10-shortcuts-every-chromebook-owner-should-know/)<br/><br/>- The desktop. You don't actually use it for anything other than to display your wallpaper; I can't tell you how often I try to drag things onto it, simply because I'm used to doing that. Everything you're going to use is on the taskbar. So find yourself a good wallpaper, since it won't be hidden by icons. I've got a stunning image of the Tarantula Nebula, myself.<br/><br/>All in all? It's exactly what I need it to be, and it's perfect. 10/10 would recommend, and all that.
I knew that chromebooks used the ChromeOS.  However, I made the mistake of thinking that the same apps that I have on my Nexus would also be available for my Chromebook.  Big mistake!  And I'm not talking about obscure, 3rd-party apps.  I can watch TV on my Nexus using the google Fiber app but for some reason this app does not exist for the Chromebook.  There are about a dozen other quality apps I use regularly on my Nexus that aren't available for chromebooks (there are, however, thousands of useless apps available!).  Very disappointing when google doesn't support its own OS.  For money, I would recommend getting a Nexus tablet (which seems to have more apps) or spending a little extra and get a Windows-based laptop that isn't handcuffed by the ChromeOS.
I've only had the Acer Chromebook 11 for 2-3 days (so I've still got my rose-coloured glasses on) but my overall first impressions are very positive. (Long list of PROs and CONs below)<br/><br/>I currently have a MacBook Air (MBA) Mid-2012 and an iPad Air 2. I use my iPad Air 2 with an external keyboard at work, however, I find the experience a bit compromised and I’ve always wanted to try out Chrome OS. And my MBA is used at home by my Wife and I, so it doesn't go to work. It also doesn't have the battery life to achieve what I need.<br/><br/>So, I used my Acer Chromebook 11 at work today, and was pretty impressed with the performance and use-case (and the outstanding battery life). I use Google Docs at work for meetings, notes, etc. Using the Chromebook today, I found I could achieve my same work a lot faster than with my iPad Air 2 setup. My typing was faster and more accurate, correcting mistakes and moving around a document/spread sheet was a lot fast, and browsing of the web was more enjoyable because you are getting the desktop web. One difference, though, is that my iPad Air 2 gets push notifications for text, email, etc, whereas this doesn't seem to be possible for the Chromebook (not that I was expecting it too). It's also easier to charge my iPad at work, and my white Chromebook certainly stood out!<br/><br/>Here are my current PROS and CONS for the Acer Chromebook 11:<br/><br/>PROS<br/>• the screen is better than I was expecting (it's definitely not in the league of iPads, Samsungs or other IPS panels, but it looks fantastic for a budget PC. I was considering the Lenovo 100S, but the screen on that is terrible compared to the Acer Chromebook)<br/>• the battery is superb!! I am amazed with the battery life on this thing. I can't get over how much I am impressed with the battery life. It easily surpasses my mid-2012 Macbook Air.<br/>• it's pretty fast all around, especially considering the specs. I only notice slow down when I have 6+ tabs open, including having YouTube open. (I think this is more a RAM problem than processor. 4GB in a Chromebook would probably be perfect)<br/>• the keyboard is pretty nice too. I'm still getting used to the Chrome OS specific keys, but overall it feels nice to type on.<br/>• the trackpad works really well and is quite large. Scrolling is as good as any mac I've tried.<br/>• although the body of the laptop doesn't look as good in real life as it does in the product photos, it still feels very solid for such a cheap laptop. There are no creaks in the plastic either.<br/>• internet browsing on the Chromebook is very fast. But for some content-heavy web pages, you have to wait until the webpage has finished loading before you can scroll and move around smoothly. This isn't a problem, just a slight different between iOS/Mac and the Chromebook.<br/>• I'm still getting used to Chrome OS. So far, I like it for my intended use for this laptop - using Google Docs at work, and browsing the web and YouTube at home.<br/>• the WiFi is crazy good in this laptop. It's by far got a stronger antenna than my iPhone 6s Plus and iPad Air 2.<br/>• the speakers are actually pretty good, and loud. Much better than I was expecting. I would probably say that the speakers in the Chromebook sounds louder than my iPad Air 2.<br/>• the output from the 3.5mm audio jack is also very, very loud.<br/>• Google Docs seems to work fine in offline mode, and everything just syncs again when you re-connect to the internet.<br/>• this thing cold boots fast, and wakes from sleep within 1-2 seconds. Very nice.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>I only have a couple of cons:<br/>• the keyboard letter keys make nice sounds when you type on them, but my spacebar key is alot 'clickier' than the rest of the keys and makes a noticeably annoying clicky sound. (I know, it's a HUGE deal)<br/>• it's the same with the track pad. I like tapping the track pad (not clicking it), and when you just tap the bottom half of the track pad it makes a sounds because there must be an air gap between the top of the track pad the bottom click mechanism. I don't know if this is specific to my laptop, or on everyone. I am half tempted to open it and see if I can alter it…<br/>• the actual click on the trackpad is REALLY loud too.<br/>• I tethered my iPhone to my Chromebook for internet access. I would've liked the Chromebook to hold the connection, even when in sleep mode. It's not a big deal, it just means I need to re-open the settings->hotpost section of my iPhone each time I turned on the Chromebook.<br/>And that's it! Really minor complaints.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, I can't believe this computer only cost me about $135 AUD (after credits and other promotions). It's an absolute steal.<br/><br/>If I end up sticking with this laptop long term, I'll probably dream of a couple of key upgrades: 4GB RAM, a nice IPS panel, backlit keys, and charging via MicroUSB or USB-C, not proprietary cords. (but then the Chromebook would probably cost $300-500, not $94.99)<br/><br/>Final thoughts:<br/><br/>This device won't be replacing my MacBook Air at all. I routinely tell people that my MacBook Air mid-2012 (my first ever Mac - and still my only Mac) is the best computer I've ever owned. The only thing letting it down these days is battery life. I'm lucky to get 3 hours out of it.<br/><br/>I see the Chromebook as a 'much enhanced' iPad Air 2 experience for school, work and casual browsing. I don't really see it as a proper 'computer' to replace a Mac or a Windows Laptop for all other uses. So I'm not really comparing the Chromebook to the MacBook Air (except for browsing and YouTube, and the huge difference in battery life - which wouldn't be a big deal for newer MacBook Air's).<br/><br/>The Chromebook also won't replace my iPad Air 2 (which is better for movies and a bit of gaming). For me, the Chromebook slots into a small section of my work life for portable computing on the go that's light and fast, and web browsing and YouTube at home. I will also prefer having the full desktop internet experience, and I significantly prefer a physical keyboard.<br/><br/>Like I said, I still have rose-coloured glasses on. I don't want to build up too much hype, because your MacBook, Windows computer or Desktop are still a lot faster and more capable than this little Chromebook. However, I'm still absolutely amazed with the performance and quality of the device for the cost. $94.99USD is an unbelievable price for what you get! Thank you Acer, Amazon and Google!
Why are there so few reviews for computers for senior citizens?  I spent weeks researching the perfect laptop for my 80 year old grandmother.  She had been using a desktop computer from 2005.  Needless to say, the desktop computer was already past its life expectancy.  I researched the differences between Chromebooks and regular PCs.  The reviews on this product are numerous and extremely helpful.  After thoroughly researching options and reading the reviews for this product, I purchased it for my grandmother.  It was delivered via Amazon Prime in 2 days as promised.  I added the optional protection coverage because it was inexpensive and well... my grandmother is 80.  It's hard to tell what kind of abuse this Chromebook may endure over the next 2 years.  As soon as it was delivered, I walked it over to her house.  I sat down with her and we opened it together.  Upon taking it out of the box I was stunned at how lightweight it is.  Yes, the shell is plastic- however it still seems sturdy enough.  There is a quick start sheet inside the box that shows how to quickly set it up.  Basically, plug in the Chromebook and then turn the power on.  First step was to connect to my grannie's WiFi.  No problem there.  Then I set up a free Google account for her.  Again, no problem.  There is an easy tutorial that comes up to show you what you can do on your new Chromebook.  I walked her through only the parts that she would use.  I showed her how the touch pad works- how to turn the machine on and off- how to access Chrome to search the internet- and then I added the Facebook app for her.  Less than 1/2 hr later I walked out the door so she could play with her new toy.  So let's walk through the pros and cons of this Acer Chromebook when used by Senior Citizens.<br/>Pros:<br/>-Setup is simple.  If the senior is new to the laptop concept, there will be slight learning curve to using the touchpad vs using a mouse.  I told my grannie to try out the touchpad for 1 week to see if she could get used to it.  I told her if she couldn't get used to it then I would buy her a mouse.  Yes, you can connect a mouse to this Chromebook.  (Within 1/2 hour she said she loves the touchpad and has no need for a mouse.)<br/>-No need to worry about updates.  No need to worry about anti-virus software.  No annoying pop-ups regarding programs that are running in the background.  No need to call your granddaughter at work because you got some strange pop up that states your computer can't do an update because the blah blah blah definitions are out of date.<br/>-Straightforward, easy to use<br/>-Lightweight for arthritic hands to carry around<br/>-Exceptional battery life<br/>-Matte screen (anti-glare)<br/>-Screen has adjustable brightness<br/>-Keys are black with white lettering, nice key feel with a slight clicking sound as you type<br/>-Automatically connects to internet when you turn it on, remembers your settings<br/>-If you don't power down, but instead just fold the screen down- it will go into sleep mode and keep up your user profile so you don't have to type in your credentials each time you open the screen up (unless you change this in the settings).<br/>-Amazon offers a protection plan through a 3rd party.  This protection plan was inexpensive and covers the laptop against damage from accidental drops or spills for 2 years.  This gives peace of mind to the senior using the laptop.<br/>-Depending on where your wireless router is inside your house/building, I found the range with this laptop to be quite impressive.  My grandmother can sit outside on her screened in porch to browse the internet- something she is extremely excited about!<br/>-Fast!  Of course, this depends on your internet connection speed.  So, let's just say the processor is fast and since no programs are running in the background my grandmother can pull up her favorite websites quickly.<br/>-Finally, I cannot neglect to acknowledge the low price tag on this machine.  It makes me seriously wonder why I felt the need to spend so much money on my MacBook Air for myself.  I was wowed by how much my MacBook Air can do, but in reality, I only use about 10% of the features it affords. With the Apple iCloud, all my documents and pics are stored in a cloud- a Chromebook does the same thing. Since I mainly surf the internet, manage my photos, and occasionally edit a Word or Excel document, this Acer Chromebook would have fit my needs as well.  And at about 10% of the cost!<br/>CONS:<br/>-The small screen size may be difficult for seniors who experience difficulty reading small print.  A larger screen size may be more ideal for many seniors (My grannie miraculously has perfect eyesight, so this was not an issue for her).<br/>- Some seniors have difficulty seeing white print on black keys.  You may need to consider a keyboard with black print on white keys and a larger keypad in general<br/>-Many seniors use laptops for more than just web browsing.  A Chromebook may pose limitations on what they can do.  Some people don't trust a cloud for storing documents and pictures.<br/><br/>Overall:  My grandmother needed a simple and very easy to use laptop for web browsing, shopping online and checking Facebook.  This Acer Chromebook was an ideal choice for her.  Set-up was extremely easy.  Grannie likes the small size, likes that she doesn't have pop-ups all over the place and likes that it is lightweight enough to carry around the house.  If the senior in your life has limited vision, I'd still go for an Acer Chromebook-- just maybe get the 13.3" or 15.6".  On Amazon all 3 options are offered at an incredible price!
Purchased for a student who is the first in her family to head off to college. This budget-friendly Acer Chromebook fit her needs perfectly and at the right price. The island-style keyboard, USB (2.0 and 3.0) ports, HDMI port, webcam and 11.6" screen size were all appealing to her, but the Acer brand and price under one-forty really peaked her interest.  After we watched a few YouTube videos on it she was sold!<br/><br/>Chromebooks are a great way for non-techs to view web content, email, and do basic computing tasks with the Google Drive suite of apps. They also offer the ability to watch Hulu and Netflix (with subscriptions - not included) and use social media. Perfect for kids to do homework, grandparents to email, and anyone who wants a cheap, lightweight laptop but who doesn't need a wired connection (Chromebooks are Wifi only) or the ability to use software not available as an app in the Google Play Store.<br/><br/>That being said, this is a great value if it fits your needs. It has great performance even with only 2GB of memory and a Celeron processor, and offers a lot of features for the low price point.<br/><br/>---------------------------------------<br/><br/>Things I like about this product:<br/><br/>+ The low price!<br/><br/>+ Quick to boot, this one takes less than 10 seconds to be ready to go!<br/><br/>+ Up to 8.5 hours of battery life per full charge.<br/><br/>+ Sleek, think profile with weight at only 2.43 pounds. ( Perfect for carrying around in a backpack or messenger bag at school.)<br/><br/>+ Capable of new 'ac' wireless standard - fastest available when used with ac wireless routers.<br/><br/>+ Fanless design means it's 'silent' when running, but still runs efficiently cool.<br/><br/>+ HDMI port means you can hook it up to your HDTV and use it as a big monitor.<br/><br/>+ 11.6" anti-glare display allows you to use the Chromebook outside without a reflection.<br/><br/>+ 100 GB of FREE Google Drive Storage for 2 years (after redeeming offer) is good across all your PCs, tablets, Chromebooks, and Mac when accessing Google Drive.<br/><br/>+ Gogo 12 month internet pass included.<br/><br/>+ Music on Google Play - free for 60 days.<br/><br/>+ No need to install an antivirus software on a Chrome OS.<br/><br/>+ Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity works to add external speakers and headphones, and sync Chromebook with other devices.<br/><br/>+ Webcam resolution in HD: 1280 x 720.<br/><br/>+ 1 year limited warranty.<br/><br/>-------------------------<br/><br/>What I wish was better...<br/><br/>+/- Celeron processor is cheap and not as fast as higher end Intel processors, but it keeps the Chromebook price down and works with the Google Chrome operating system well enough.<br/><br/>+/- Screen resolution is 1366 x 768 which is not HD quality, but at this screen size, you can't really notice.<br/><br/>+- Flash memory (internal) for operating system and general storage is only 16GB, half of which is already used by the operating system when you get it. Not a surprise, and if you effectively use external flash drives and your Google Drive account (and others), you'll be in good shape.<br/><br/>+/- The speakers are OK, but certainly not high quality.  There's an audio out port to add external speakers and you can use headphones (with or without a microphone); line in or Bluetooth with this Chromebook.<br/><br/>+/- The Chromebook has a SD card reader near the USB 3.0 port, however the card sticks out versus docking in a way that is flush with the Chromebook.<br/><br/>+/- I think all Chromebooks should come with 4GB of memory as a standard - not 2GB.  There's no way to upgrade the device either.<br/><br/>-------------------------------<br/><br/>What the Chromebook CB3-111-C670 does not have...<br/><br/>- No optical drive. (This is the case with all Chromebooks, but you can get a USB driven optical drive to use with it, however you need to check the Chromebook website for a list of supported external devices like drives, keyboards and mice.)<br/><br/>- No backlighting on the keyboard.<br/><br/>- Skype is currently not supported on Chromebooks.<br/><br/>- NO ethernet port; Wifi only!<br/><br/>---------------------------------------<br/><br/>CONCLUSION:<br/><br/>The college-bound student I purchased this Chromebook for LOVES it! After having purchased two others (for my tech-challenged step-father and husband), I'm sold on their usefulness and ease of use.<br/><br/>If you are in need of a laptop for your elementary, middle, high school or college aged child to carry around and do web-based homework, this is worth considering. It's also a good choice for non-tech types who have trouble using Windows or Mac computers.<br/><br/>Note that it's necessary to have a wireless connection to use it, and it doesn't work with Skype. There's no optical (CD or DVD drive) in it, but some external accessories are supported.  The internal memory and flash drive are not upgradeable - it is what it is, but if it's what you need and you don't mind using cloud storage and the Google apps for programs - it's wonderful!<br/><br/>At this low price point it's tough to beat for internet surfing, email, and social media, as well as using the Google Drive suite of apps. Definitely a product that is well made and does what it promises to do. I highly recommend it!<br/><br/>------------------------<br/>-------------------------
I am in love. This chromebook is just the right size, it's not too small (I originally owned a Acer Aspire Netbook, which was awesome, but a little too small.) This Chromebook is not huge like a laptop, which I always struggle with manuevring on my lap. But this Chromebook does take some getting used to but so far it all has been seamless. I did have a few issues with the chromebook freezing up, but since I was able to do a reboot, it seems to have been running fine since. (Which you just hold Ctrl + in the top row of keys the circle with the arrow) And it is amazingly fast at rebooting. Which I had made lots of changes in the settings and had added my wireless printer and I was not sure on how to do a reboot being as when you do make changes, it's best to reboot your laptop, computer, etc. Also, to right click in which to copy, paste, open in new tab, etc, You just click the fingerpad with two fingers. Tada! I feel like a whiz kid. lol<br/><br/>I love how this chromebook feels lightweight and while having it on my lap, does not get hot like my netbook would. The materials do feels a little cheap. But for the price, I'm not complaining.<br/><br/>I did pick this up at Target since it is on sale this week for $129, plus Cartwheel gives you an extra 5% plus Red Card another 5%. So the price I paid is about $110.<br/><br/>I will be using this for my business, I sell on eBay and Etsy. And when I need to revise my listings, or create new ones, I can do this from the comfort of my couch instead of sitting at my desk. I love that this comes with Google Drive storage for 2 years. I was planning on purchasing Amazon Cloud, but will use Drive in the meantime.<br/><br/>I have only had this 3 days and will update this as I move along. I was a little bummed that I can't down iTunes to this. I would have loved to have the ability to rip my music cd's to iTunes on my down times, plus then I don't have to haul music cd's up to the second level of my house. :)
Seven months ago, while on a trip to Las Vegas (I'm from Canada), we went to Best Buy to purchase the Acer C720P.  However, they were no longer selling that model and instead had this one.  I was a little disappointed because I did so much research on the C720P, but I bought this anyways as I wanted to try Chromebook.<br/><br/>Fast forward to today....my girlfriend and I LOVE it!  No surprise that the Acer CB3-111 is currently the best-selling laptop on Amazon.  We use it every day.  My girlfriend bought a bigger Samsung 15.4" laptop just last year but she rarely uses that.  Reason being the Chromebook is so light and fast to boot up.  You open the lid and it just starts working with no hassles.  Unlike Windows.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>*******<br/>- SMALL AND LIGHT.  Especially when lying in bed or on the couch.  I also take it with me everywhere.  Just toss it into a bag and go.<br/><br/>- ANTI-GLARE SCREEN.  One major aspect this Acer stood apart from others was the screen.  It has a matte anti-glare screen which is nice because I hate looking at reflections.  Moreover, all the other Chromebooks seemed to have a subtle fuzziness around the edges of icons and text no matter how high or low I set the resolution.  Whereas, this Acer is crisp and clear.<br/><br/>- CHROME OS.  Chromebooks, in general, are so nice.  Much of my activity is on the web these days and Chrome OS is built for that.  The operating system is just so simple, yet has everything I need.  Furthermore, all my Chrome extensions followed me onto the Chromebook which made it seamless.<br/><br/>- NO FAN.  No noise.  Gets a little warm, but never hot.<br/><br/>- TRACKPAD.  Love the 2 and 3 finger taps and gestures.  No need for a mouse.<br/><br/>- BATTERY LIFE.  Super long battery life.  I never worry about battery when I go out with it.<br/><br/>- PRICE.  Unbelievable value for such a cheap price!  Additionally, I find I take it out with me more than I would a laptop because if this breaks or gets stolen, I won't be too upset.  I can always buy another and my data is in the cloud.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>*******<br/>- NOT SUPER FAST.  Definitely not as fast as a PC.  You can't have 10 tabs open playing videos and music -- you will notice a lag.  But for regular use, it's perfect.
Heals the tendinitis/ arthritis in my index finger. The only keyboard out there that does not irritate it. On top of that this is a beyond spectacular product. By adding Crouton you essentially have yourself a Macbook.
We love the Acer Chromebook.This is not hyperbole - we really do love our Chromebook. While we use several other laptops for our business we find ourselves, for some tasks, we prefer the chromebook. While the Acer Chromebook can't Windows, or any operating system other than Google's proprietary suite... but frankly... for most of our tasks that is perfect.<br/><br/>Again, we have both high powered Macs and PCs for doing our video and photo editing - but the ACER Chromebook has a couple major advantages over everything else that we own... it is super lightweight and small.... and it works perfectly for surfing the internet and doing our email.... and I do mean perfectly.<br/><br/>Notes -<br/><br/>-Ultra simple design - there really isn't much software that you can put on the computer so it doesn't require much time for start up. Another advantage is that the battery life is awesome. we typically can get 8-10 hours on a charge (as a guess).<br/><br/>- Can use and read SD cards<br/><br/>- Small enough that it will fit in a purse. My wife loves to drop her chromebook in her purse and then answer emails at the local coffee shop.<br/><br/>- Any many ways the ACER Chromebook is the perfect hybrid of a laptop and a tablet. It is small and convenient like a tablet, but it is much more *typer* friendly for emails, Facebook, or really - anything on the net.<br/><br/>-The screen is only so-so, but at this price point that is a trade off that we are happy to make!<br/><br/>- Built in camera for Skype - although we have never used it<br/><br/>- No problem connecting to our router and it has a reasonably strong antenna.<br/><br/>- Unlike a traditional laptop it generates very little heat.<br/><br/>Final verdict - The Acer Chromebook has become out go-to computer for travel, email, Facebook, or anything where want the convenience of a laptop but the size of a tablet. At this price point it also makes a very nice gift for any parent or grandparent who is looking for a very basic way to heck their email... and to view pictures on Faceboo.<br/><br/>5 Stars
Remember netbooks? Those small, cheap under-powered little computers have grown up and this little Acer Chromebook is a prime example of how the concept of small, inexpensive laptops designed for web-browsing, and light computing has evolved. Google has pretty much doubled down on the concept a few years ago by turning its Chrome browser into an operating system.<br/><br/>But theory is one thing and practice is another. After all, even though web browsing is considered light computing, install a few extensions, open a few dozen tabs (and modern web pages are so laden with crap like Javascript), and you can easily bring a "real" computer to its knees. And this Acer Chromebook is no different. Having said that, it was made to browse the web first and foremost, and it is no more bogged down by heavy web use than any other mid-range laptop.<br/><br/>I have about thirty extensions and tend to keep about eight to twelve tabs open at all times. (Basically I have GMail, Facebook, and Tumbler, plus Feedly and a couple of other web sites open at all times.) After a few hours of jumping back and forth between a lot of different pages this computer does slow down. But that will happen to most low-end and mid-range computers. And this is where the Chromebook's stripped down OS and Solid State Drive shine. This machine boots up in less than ten seconds. So if it becomes bogged down, I just restart it. I don't have to close any of my browser pages. I just click on the shutdown button and the Chromebook shuts itself down gracefully, restarts, let's me log back in and reopens my browser tabs; all in about ten seconds. By comparison, even the most powerful desktop computer will usually take about thirty seconds to a minute to start up and you have to reopen your web browser and wait for it to start separately. Even when restoring from sleep mode, many "real" computers will usually take as long or even longer than this Chromebook does to boot up. That is a huge advantage.<br/><br/>Battery life is excellent. Acer claims an 8.5 hour battery life. In my experience, it might be a little less but it is still good enough that battery life is simply not an issue for me on this machine.<br/><br/>Pros: Very light, great screen, good comfortable keyboard. Fast boot times. Great battery life. Extremely inexpensive, this machines normally retails for $200 and I bought mine when it was for sale for just $160.<br/>Cons: Not a traditional computer. All apps run inside the web browser.<br/><br/>The bottom line is this: If you're a hardcore gamer or a Photoshop addict, this is not the machine for you. But if your computing life revolves around the web, this computer is perfect.
I had owned a Samsung Chromebook a few years back. One of the first Samsung models that included their own chip in it. I liked it quite a lot. It wasn't fast, and the screen wasn't that great, but you turned it on and it did what I needed it to do: browse the web. But all good things come to an end and in this case a rather brutal end. I stepped on it. I decided at that point to go the iPad way of doing things, but over time realized that I actually preferred the practicality of a Chromebook as a secondary device for myself and my wife.<br/><br/>I already have a Macbook Pro I use for school, and every day computing. And there lies the problem for me: I can't stand the screen on the Acer. It's almost exactly the same as the Samsung Chromebook from years past. I've been sitting here for months using a retina display Macbook and to then switch over to the Chromebook for basic web browsing tasks is too brutal on my spoiled eyes. For this reason I'm swapping it out for the Toshiba Chromebook 2 1080p model. Yes, that model is $130 more so it's not a completely even swap here, i'm paying more for something a little better. For this reason alone I can't fault a $200 machine that is adequately capable.<br/><br/>Some Things I enjoyed about this machine:<br/><br/>Zippier than my old Samsung, and overall satisfied with the performance. It's not buttery smooth, but I never really felt bogged down when switching between tabs or websites.<br/><br/>Battery life is good. 8 - 10 hours<br/><br/>Seems to run cool. Heavy flash videos didn't heat up the machine that I could tell.<br/><br/>2GB of ram still seems more than sufficient for Chrome OS<br/><br/>Trackpad was kinda of lousy, but the keyboard was surprisingly good.<br/>..<br/>That's really it for me. If you're ok with washed out screens, for $200 this is a capable machine for doing web related tasks.
This thing is amazing so far. I wanted something portable and practical, without the bulk and pricetag of a full laptop since I have a perfectly capable PC at home. The price is incredible for what you get here. The speed is awesome! It boots up and loads pages lightning fast. My PC has an SSD and I was still impressed.<br/><br/>A lot of the complaints I'm reading are from people who don't understand what a Chromebook is for. These things are meant to be cost-efficient and extremely practical machines that are mainly just for internet browsing, streaming and word processing. It is not meant for gaming or photoshop. It is bare-bones essentials in a pretty package so that you don't have to drop hundreds on a laptop if you don't need one. I urge you to look up the capabilities of a Chromebook before you purchase one, and compare that to what you actually need it for. Personally, I want to use it for online classes and studying and it's built perfectly for that. When I want to play Steam games or sync iTunes, I do that on my home PC.<br/><br/>My only problem so far is that the Chromebook got stuck on the "Determining Device Configuration" screen, and it was easily solved with a reboot. I have had no troubles since. It connected flawlessly to my gmail account, and the advertised 100GB of Google Drive space was apparently bumped up to a Terabyte (1000GB). Maybe I read it wrong but that was a nice surprise. It's free for two years.<br/><br/>If you are an avid Google user, you will find that all of your Chrome settings port over seamlessly from your home computer. My theme, bookmarks and preferences were all imported without me having to do anything.<br/><br/>The quality of the Chromebook itself is great for the price (great anyway, but ESPECIALLY for the price). The white color looks very clean and modern. My mom has a newer Chromebook and when she saw mine she said "Oh, yours is nicer than mine!". Looks great, feels sturdy. No backlit keys on the keyboard is my only gripe with the structure of it.<br/><br/>Lastly, the battery life blows away my old laptop and even my phone. I've been using it for almost five hours straight unplugged (internet browsing and playing music) and I'm still at 71%. I feel like I'm going to lose the charger if I'm not careful because I wont be using it much. If you want something easy, portable and long-lasting- this Chromebook is an awesome deal. I think it's cheaper because it doesn't have a touchscreen, but who needs that anyway? If that doesn't bother you, you're getting a great bargain.
I purchased two of these at BB for $150 and just had the opportunity to play with it for a couple of days.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>It does what it is meant to do. It is not a windows or IOS machine. It is a surfing machine that allows you to take full use of the Google system to write documents, print to a cloud-enable printer, play light games and surf the internet quickly.<br/><br/>No lag between between browser opening and rendering.<br/><br/>Videos from YouTube look great. Streaming live programming works beautifully. (If you have a chromecast stick as well, you won't miss cable)<br/><br/>Small form factor and light-weight. It fits in a backpack, purse, bag... glove compartment.<br/><br/>Screen has no glare which makes it easier to read books, articles, and blogs in almost any setting.<br/><br/>The screen size seems perfectly normal for anyone used to switching between their laptop/desktop to a tablet.<br/><br/>Keyboard is intuitive for typing. I had to actually think about the keyboard when writing this because the switch from laptop to this keyboard was effortless.<br/><br/>The track pad is large and easy to use if you like working with track pads instead of a mouse. The double-click can be disabled if desired in the settings.<br/><br/>The sound is great on this little machine, voices in movies and TV programs are clear. You may want to raise the Chromebook by adding removable feet *see cons below*<br/><br/>Battery life is about 8 hours of continuous use (more if you lower settings) and it charges quickly. I got it from the store with no charge at all. In about 2 hours, the battery was fully charged.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>Here is why this review did not get 5 stars;<br/><br/>The only way to disable the track pad is via command line and this is only temporary. This may be cumbersome for people who want to use an external mouse most of the time and not accidentally touch the track pad and make errors.<br/><br/>The speakers are located on the bottom of the machine. This means that when you use it on your lap or atop a table/desk, you are not getting the full effect of the speakers. IMO, this is an idiotic location for speakers and getting removable feet just takes away from the no-fuss, no-muss, of what this piece of equipment is designed to do. Besides getting "feet" to prop the unit to get full use of the speakers, the other solutions involve a Bluetooth speakers or headphones.<br/><br/>There are others out there that Velcro onto the machine, or are permanently attached and fold out, but these will give you an idea of what I mean by removable feet: http://www.amazon.com/Fred-Friends-Istuck-Laptop-Feet/dp/B00C3O0W0E/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1417735766&sr;=8-2&keywords;=feet+to+raise+laptop<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>Taking this to campus or a trip is ideal due to its lack of bulk and weight, has a keyboard (better than most tablets) and it is a fast web surfer and movie-watching machine while waiting for a couple of hours or sitting in a plane.
This is a fine Chromebook for the money, and a nice, if small, upgrade from the Acer C720, which I also own. The white finish is visually appealing, and its contrast with the colors of the screen makes the screen seem a bit larger, though of course it's the same size. The screen is also visibly richer in color than on the C720. The AC jack has been moved from the side of the machine to the back, which I think works better. This one is about 5 ounces lighter than the C720, enough to make a noticeable difference when carrying it around. The processor is a better one as well, though I can't say I noticed much difference in performance; the Chromebook is already fast enough that added speed is probably measured in very small increments. My only complaint about this machine vs. the C720 is that this one takes slightly longer to reconnect to the Internet when I open the lid. It's still a matter of seconds, so hardly a major issue, but it does mean the loss of the "open it, click immediately" feel of the C720.<br/><br/>Setting aside comparisons and speaking generally, I'm happy with this Chromebook. The battery life is great. I'm the type who forgets to plug things back in even when they're sitting next to the adapter, and I hardly ever get "please plug me in" messages on this Chromebook. It also charges fast when you do plug it in. The speakers are strong considering the size and cost; I've gotten less impressive sound from full laptops with much higher costs. The cramped keyboard is an adjustment if you're used to a full-sized laptop layout, but once you get used to it, it gets to seem normal and it'll be the laptop that feels wrong-sized and awkward. My only regret is the absence of separate touchpad buttons (I'm not good at two-finger tapping) and dedicated page up/page down keys (a two-button shortcut just isn't as naturally when scrolling through something). But those are pretty small trade-offs for a cheaper, faster device that covers most casual computing needs. Despite coming in at the low end of Chromebook pricing, the Acer 11 CB3-111-C670 is a quality machine, well worth considering for those new to Chromebooks.
I usually don't write many reviews, but since I use this device so heavily, I figured I'd type this up for the people out there who need yet another good review for this out of the 1100+ reviews on this product.<br/><br/>I work online from home as a live chat operator, and normally, I would have done that from my custom-built desktop PC, but now I use this chromebook exclusively for my live chat work. The epic battery life, surprisingly not-terrible chiclet keyboard, light weight, smooth and accurate trackpad, and decently loud speakers make this a wonderful device for someone who works online like I do. using a combination of chrome extensions, webapps, and online services, it's actually a pretty powerful work device, with the portability and speed of smartphones and tablets, I even took this thing on a vacation and built my personal website using it. I love being able to simply charge it at night, and then not worry about the battery at all during the day. I even recommended this to my grandmother when her HP AIO's hard drive died, since Chrome OS has a "dock" feature that makes it very easy to turn it into a desktop, and she has loved it as well!<br/><br/>A lot of people don't really like Chrome OS, but that's simply because they don't have a use for it, their work requires more heavy power-user type software that the Chromebook can't run, (if I were still working in video editing I would probably be the same way, but that's what I have my desktop for, this is really best as a portable companion device.) but for the people who DO have a use for it, it's awesome, and I'm actually looking into purchasing another more fully-featured touchscreen Chromebook because this one has served me so well.
The Chromebook concept is excellent.  I chose this model because it had a faster processor.  I'm not sure if that makes a difference, but my big mistake was to settle for the 11-inch display.  That size is fine for watching a movie, but when it comes to reading web sites, I always have to result to Ctrl+ in order for my old eyes to make out the text. And there's no 'plus' key available except with the shift key over the = key.  Another thing that's an annoyance that doesn't really rise to the level of dissatisfaction is that there are no cursor keys like Home, End, PageUp and PageDown.  Makes the navigation a little tedious.<br/><br/>Having cited the Cons, I have to say that the PROS are the instant availability of the entire content of my Google account, the easy transparency of the downloaded Chrome OS, the fantastic battery life, the light weight and sturdy construction of the case, and the 10-second boot time.  Great idea, those Chromebooks.  Next time I buy one, I'll spring for a bigger display, maybe 13 inches.
This was purchased for my mother. Her first laptop ever and it has been easy for her to learn. My 8 yo daughter has the same laptop and she loves it. She's been teaching grandma!!
We LOVE this Chromebook, it is lightweight, extremely low maintenance, can perform every task we need both online and off, and is absolutely perfect for a traveling family.
This Chromebook is fantastic, hardly feels like an entry-level model.  Its fast, fully functional, very light and portable, battery lasts longer than the manufacturer's estimated time, and is very easy to use.<br/><br/>By way of some background, before the details: I'm a long time Apple user (as in, from the original Macintosh to current).  I've been accused of being an Apple "fan-boy," though I like to think I'm a bit more objective than that.  I have a great little Macbook Air as my work computer and my personal home computer is an iPad.  No complaints whatsoever.<br/><br/>The college I work for uses Google Apps, I've used Gmail/Googel Docs personally for a long time, and even the two foundations I serve on have Google Apps environments.  So when I decided I wanted a low-cost laptop for occasional personal use a Chromebook seemed like it would be the perfect solution.  The first two I was able to use, both current models and both more expensive than this Acer, were awful.  They felt inexplicably slow for a computer that was primarily running a web browser for an OS. Painfully slow.  I didn't last a full week with either of them, and was disappointed.  I wanted to like the Chromebook solution, but those first two experiences almost made me give up.<br/><br/>Then I came across a review of this Acer 11, saw all the (mostly) positive reviews, and the very low price and decided to give it another shot.  This time around, it worked beautifully.<br/><br/>The Chromebook itself is nicely made.  It is plastic, and certainly feels less significant than my Macbook Air.  The lip formed by the keyboard/trackpad plate, where it overlaps the molded bottom/sides shell, has a tellingly plastic feel to it in particular.  But despite that first impression, it is well made and fitted.  It doesn't feel flimsy and the screen/lid is solid enough that I haven't ever worried about it flexing and breaking.<br/><br/>The keyboard is perfect.  The keys have just the right amount of travel and sensitivity.  Really, they feel almost identical to the Macbook Air keys.  The track is also very good, though a tad less smooth than the Air's.  Even so, I haven't had any issues using it or switching back and forth between the two laptops.  For a Macbook user, this keyboard and trackpad will feel very familiar and comfortable.<br/><br/>Battery life is very solid, and I routinely get more time out of it than is promised.  The screen is bright enough, resolution is fine, and the matte finish helps with glare.  It isn't anything as good as a retina caliber display, but quite good enough for regular use.  I also like that the screen can be tipped back until almost parallel with the keyboard.  This really helps when finding just the right viewing angle, especially when moving from sitting to standing.<br/><br/>The Chrome OS is the other half of the Chromebook equation.  As others have noted, it is an operating system built around Google's Chrome web browser and their suite of online ("cloud-based") tools.  You need a Google/Gmail account to run it, so if you don't already have one you will be prompted to create one when you first boot up.  Simply log in with your Gmail account and your Google apps universe is there waiting for you.  There is almost nothing to configure and almost nothing to "install."<br/><br/>Google Apps comes with a very good suite of office apps and they have continued to evolve to a point where they are full-featured and very compatible with MS Office apps.  For those who have Office 365, you can install Word, Excel, Powerpoint and use them directly, but given the compatibility between Google Apps and Office (Google Apps can now edit MS Office files directly) I'd suggest giving them a try before shelling out for Office 365.  Check out the Chrome Store to see all of the apps, extensions, and utilities available.  Anything that is Web-based is, of course, just as functional on a Chromebook as any other computer, which means I can use the iCloud beta site to run Pages, Numbers, and Keynote as well.  For most folks, and especially for personal use, the Chromebook is a very viable option.<br/><br/>I really have no complaints with this little inexpensive laptop.  This is a very different story than you would see if you read the review I left of my last Chromebook.<br/><br/>Summary: longtime Apple user, still very much an Apple user, and totally happy with this Chromebook.
After doing my research on laptops and Chromebooks I realized I could have a wonderful laptop at a fraction of the price if I purchased a Chromebook. This is everything I need in a laptop and  it's perfect for my budget. If you are a fan of Chrome and Google this will be right up your alley as all of your applications will utilize Google's OS, which is their repertoire of applications.<br/>For example:<br/>Google Hangouts instead of Skype<br/>Google Docs instead of Word<br/>You can download apps such as Spotify, Evernote, Dropbox which work within the browser. Again, after doing my research I found I can do pretty much everything I need with a laptop through Google's OS so this is perfect for me right now. Best of all, no pesky Windows updates to contend with! When I have had updates it only takes about 30 seconds for them and that's including reboot time!
Wanted to be able to load Ubuntu 14 on this machine.  However, after test driving it for the past two days, it is not worth the effort to have dual operating systems.  Google chrome is a fine example of how a great, it not excellent and lower cost computer should be.  Has almost everything that you can imagine like MS_Office and not to be mention GMAIL which somehow is able to import all your bookmarks from both Firefox and Internet Explorer.  To me, this is the stuff I was most concerned about and thinking about when installing Ubuntu. No viruses and instant software updates and not to mention an incredibly quick boot  time.  External storage using a SD card, USB Thumb drive and even other external devices as scanners, backup drives etc. just simply works everytime.  Slight different but definitely a great little computer.  The possibilities are endless.
We bought this at Best Buy and it has been really great.<br/><br/>- Super fast boot up time (probably 10 seconds or less) and wake from sleep time<br/>- Lightweight, no fan and doesn't get hot (comfortable on lap even for long periods of time)<br/>- Chrome OS is very straight forward and much more enjoyable than Windows (at least I think so)<br/>- Nice controls for quickly switching between user accounts<br/>- Keyboard hot-keys and touchpad swipe controls are very handy<br/>- Pretty speedy for normal things like using the web<br/>- The remote desktop works well<br/>- The integration with Google Drive and other Google services is very nice<br/>- I do like the matte screen, it's nice that there's not ever glare. Some people say it's hard to view from some angles but this isn't really an issue at all for me<br/><br/>It's decent for things like Netflix, max volume isn't super loud but it's alright.  Wouldn't use it for serious movie watching but that was to be expected.<br/><br/>Great computer for 95% of the things I need, but I also need Windows software like Illustrator and Photoshop, for that reason I probably wouldn't get it if I had to depend on it as my sole computer. Plus the screen is a bit small for any kind of heavy duty work.<br/><br/>My wife really likes it too... tempting to get another one at Black Friday... :)<br/><br/>Best Buy has this also and their going to be doing a Black Friday sale for $150.  The model number on the Best Buy website is CB3-111-C8UB but I'm pretty sure it's identical (you can check the specs of both on the Acer website).<br/><br/>So I think they are the same...
I'm in love with it! very nice and very neat lil lappy. muahh :* thanks and so far so goooood :) buy it. you'll never regret. :)
I bought this after much research because I have gotten tired of Windows (both Vista and 7).  Let me say this blazing fast.  Both the startup (<5 seconds) and internet which is very fast.  I keep a lot of documents/spreadsheets in lieu of paper so the move to online storage will be time consuming.  The only real issue there is that most of my spreadsheets are MS Works and google sheets doesn't like that.  So I have to open then save as excel which sheets will handle.  The other big issue is that I bought the newer cb3-111 for $199 and two days later Amazon dropped the price to $159.  Ah - capitalism in action.  It is worth the money if your tired of Windows, but it would have had a much better taste at $159.
I love Amazon's star review system, and it was a terrific help with my decision to buy the Acer Chromebook. After using it almost 4 months in the U.S.A., in the air coming to California, in Greece, Scotland, England, France and then back to the U.S.A. I am so pleased with myself because the Acer works so well. It is a perfect concept that Google has created, and I just travel around and connect with wi-fi everywhere. I've had 15 tabs open, the time between charging is long. Basically it does everything it says it will, even better than I hoped, and learning keystroke shortcuts has made it even more fun to use. The case logic case was a great idea also.
It arrived in a non-functioning state.  There are no instructions for resetting the machine included.  Acer customer support vanishes at weekends.  I needed a machine to work and quickly, I should have gone to Best Buy.
AWFUL. I don't understand why this thing got such good reviews. People all said "it only does a few basic things but it does them well" and I thought "perfect!" NOT THE CASE.<br/><br/>Ive had trouble with numerous common websites, anything from shopping for a pair of shoes to checking email online. It does a terrible job with media files, including certain image files (how much more basic does it get!?). I have a thumb drive full of movies I can't watch  on this thing and have had to learn more about "codecs" than I ever wanted (still couldn't fix it though). I've spent a TON of time trying to learn the elaborate work-arounds for this piece of junk but usually they do not work.<br/><br/>In addition, there are very few apps and extensions out there for it, and easily more than half of the ones I've tried either don't work at all or don't fix the problems I'm trying to deal with.<br/><br/>I've also encountered errors in drive where I'll make a document available for off-line use and it again, not working. No way to tell until I'm actually offline, which can be quite frustrating.<br/><br/>Top it all off with a disorienting interface and it's really a far cry from the simple, headache-free machine it was marketed as.
Great laptop at a cheap price. It's light, the battery lasts all day, there's no noise or heat, and the matte screen is surprisingly decent. Note: Chrubuntu is not compatible this Intel chip (as of March 2015), but crouton/unity installed fine. MATLAB installed without much hassle and performs non-parallelized tasks at reasonable speeds.
The unit was clearly refurbished, although the description said new. I took it out of the box and the computer was already on. The touchpad was damaged as well. Seems like they're getting back a lot of faulty chrome books and just shipping them back out. Just horrible.
I LOVE everything about this! Portability, Quick turn on/off, quick updates (just restart computer- updated in 5 seconds), great battery life, and I love the google drive. Only downside is that I wish there was more memory for files, photos, etc. You can buy more, but I haven't- it is a good excuse to clean up files.
Trying to find a cheap, decent laptop can sometimes feel like searching for a live unicorn, impossible.  I've been a Mac user for years, and  unfortunately my MacBook started running painfully slow this past spring.  As a college student I needed a computer to get my work done but couldn't afford a new Mac on my student budget.  I'm not a huge fan of Windows OS so a friend of mine suggested I look into Chromebooks.  I must have read nearly every online tech journal suggestion and amazon review for different Chromebooks and after a couple months of research I determined that this Acer Chromebook was going to be the best for my budget, and, so far I am very impressed.<br/><br/>  I will say that I think this Chromebook is better quality than you would assume from the price, however, if your used to high resolution screen quality you may be disappointed (for all of you high resolution snobs out there).<br/><br/>  Things I like about the laptop:<br/>  -  It's compact although not so small its difficult to use.<br/>  -  It has an SD card reader, which may not be a huge deal to most people, but I've never had one in my laptop so I love it!<br/>  -  It's easy to hook up to my TV using an HDMI cable so I can watch shows or share pictures with friends<br/>  -  It's easy to clean if I get smudges etc. on it<br/>  -  The Chrome OS is easy to use and clean, although I must say it does take some getting used to if you're used to other operating systems<br/>  -  The charging cord isn't big and clunky.  It's easy to pack away and not a complete eyesore<br/><br/>Like I said above, overall I really like this laptop.  As a college student it does everything I need it to do.  I'm able to write emails easily, access videos, write papers using Google Docs and save "sticky notes" to my desktop.  I was also able to import my iTunes library from my MacBook which is great.  If you're looking for a laptop that can handle heavy computing, gaming or media editing (photos, videos, etc.) this probably won't be the best choice for you, but if you want something to surf the internet, listen to music, or create documents then it is more than sufficient and an excellent choice.  Really for the price it can't be beat and I would definitely recommend it to anyone searching from a Chromebook.<br/><br/>In the end I do need to note a bit of a nuisance I experienced when initially setting up the chromebook.  After entering all of my wireless network information I couldn't get it to connect to wifi, no matter how hard I tried.  Finally I had a friend with a hotspot help me. We reset the Chromebook to factory settings then tried again, and the second time I had no problem.  Not sure if the issue stemmed from the machine itself or my network the first time around.  It was annoying, but in the end didn't effect my overall impression of this Acer Chromebook.
I love my Acer Chromebook!  This is my second Acer computer.  I purchased Acer's because our IT person at school said they are the brand he has to work on the least.  I bought the Chromebook to use in my classroom to help me go paperless.  I read all the reviews, and the price is what finally sold me.  I have not yet been disappointed.  It is super fast and connects beautifully to all the wifi locations I have tried.  Also, it has a great battery life.  As long as I shut down the computer when I finish, I can usually get five or more hours out of a battery charge.  Having said that, there are some limitations you might want to take into consideration before purchasing:<br/>1.  This computer has a Chrome operating system.  As such, you will probably not be able to download quite a few of the programs you are used to using.  My gradebook web site does not support Chrome, so I have to do all of my grades on my regular PC or my iPad.  It is clearly designed to run Chrome only programs.<br/>2.  You must have wifi to use this computer.  Without a wifi connection, it is basically a doorstop.  Since I bought it to use with my Google apps, that is perfectly fine for me.  However, because of the limited operating system and limited storage, you cannot do very much offline with it.<br/>3.  Google apps run perfectly!  As a teacher, I use Google mail, Google Classroom, and many other Google apps.  They run beautifully on this computer.<br/>4.  When I first started using the computer, it would shut down frequently and restart.  I was a little nervous.  However, it seems to worked through any bugs or glitches it was having because it has worked flawlessly ever since.  It may have taken a while to get used to my programs or to fully update all the apps.<br/>I think many of the negative reviews were based on incorrect expectations for the device. I bought the Chromebook as a lightweight alternative to my regular laptop and as a more versatile alternative to my iPad (the Google Drive and Google Classroom apps are just a step above useless on the iPad).  In this regard, the Chromebook has exceeded my expectations.  If you are expecting a fully  functioning counterpart to a computer or MacBook, then you will probably be disappointed.  But, it you are wanting a lightweight computer to access on-line documents, check email, and check/update social media, then this is a great computer!  I recommend it highly, but be sure you purchase it with all the limitations in mind.
Four stars for product quality and out-of-the-box customer experience, five stars for Amazon customer service (which I am not rating, as this is a product review), one *negative* star for Comcast customer service, one star for Acer customer service, and two stars for Google Chromebook/ChromeOS customer service.<br/><br/>Here's the catch, and I'm imagining that some of the other one and two star reviews (along with a few Chromebook 11 returns) are also due to this problem :-O<br/><br/>About two weeks ago, Comcast sent me a notice that my cable modem was "no longer supported," and would be upgraded free of cost (not really as I pay monthly for it). They were kind enough to send a combo modem-wireless router, which I promptly installed.<br/><br/>However, this is where the problems began. The existing family phones, tablets, linux and chromebooks seemed to run a bit slower while accessing the network. I also decided to upgrade to this current model Chromebook, thinking that with a new modem-wifi unit from Comcast this would be the ticket to a better web experience - matching new ISP wifi equipment with new Chromebook wifi technology ;)<br/><br/>I was wrong. The new Chromebook 11 wouldn't even start-up or complete the Gmail registration and Chromeos update process :-O<br/><br/>I was almost ready to return the Chromebook 11, when my new Archer C9 wireless router and Arris SurfBoard cable modem arrived today via Amazon Prime. So I decommissioned my brand new Comcast combo modem-wifi and set up the Archer-Arris units in a few minutes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>And then, with extraordinary speed, the Chromebook 11 completed the set-up and I able to watch HD YouTube. Keep in mind that the 2G RAM limitation will limit concurrent tabs (especially flash-heavy adds on each page) even if you don't run HD video in one tab. But, I'm satisfied, because for under $200 I have a very portable and usable Chromebook - with very good battery life :)<br/><br/>Comcast stopped their support when one device connected and speed test is was about half of the advertised bandwidth.<br/><br/>Acer has no idea about ISP on-premise equipment, and has no guidelines for working vs. non-working wireless routers and cable modems. Google wanted to help, but couldn't offer (or take) much information regarding wifi-modem-ISP compatibility and Chromebook hardware models.
I bought a refurb for $110 and love the CB3, after installing Crouton (Ubuntu) and Wine for the one Windows program I need for work. Crouton/Ubuntu does not work perfectly with the Chrome OS keyboard yet, but I have not played much with the scripts out there designed to fix the problems. Crouton/Ubuntu allows one to get around the limitation of Chrome OS's browser-only approach to Linux: I have a full version of LibreOffice to create and modify MS Office docs. Switching back and forth between Chrome OS and Crouton/Ubuntu takes only seconds. The two OSs share the /Downloads folder, so files one downloads in Chrome OS can be modified in LibreOffice.<br/>I dislike Google Docs and Drive, so I use Dropbox and OneDrive/MS Office online. But mostly I take notes on the CB3 using a nice tabbed text editor called Caret in Chrome OS (offline). This works very well for meetings, lectures, etc.<br/>I prefer a 14 inch laptop, but the screen and chiclet keyboard on the CB3 are quite nice. Sometimes my thumbs hit the large trackpad and lose the cursor where I am typing, which is annoying, but I also like the pad because I do not have to find the mouse buttons: I can press most areas of the pad to get button response. The Chromebook keyboard itself has a learning curve, but at least it gets rid (hides, really) of the stupid caps lock key just to the left of the A key. The one thing I do not like about the keyboard is that the key letters are lower case, which (for some reason) are harder to see in dim light.I suppose this will not be a problem when I acclimate fully to the keyboard and can touch type.<br/>Before I bought the CB3 I researched a bit and found an article that likened the Chromebook to an iPad. Although I resisted using a Bluetooth keyboard with my iPad 3, which is mostly for media now, I see the point. For all areas of productivity, I prefer the EB3 Chromebook to my iPad.
I agree with the many overwhelmingly good comments left by owners and thank the authors for helping convince me to purchase my Acer Chromebook 11. It is a great value and exactly what I wanted - a small, light, inexpensive, portable computer to use for the internet and sometimes connect to the hdtv to view video clips and internet content. It is very easy to set up and to use and appears to be well made and designed. I have a Google account and used that to log in. It boots and runs very quickly, especially the network speed, page loads and when switching between windows. The video plays smoothly and the sound is good. I have relatively slow but adequate DSL, so imagine it would run faster with a better connection. It runs faster than my desktop that has a faster CPU and runs linux and windows. I have yet to explore all of the capabilities. There are a few small downsides, such as printing. It is possible to print to a cloud capable printer. I did not expect this to be able to fully replace my desktop but as it meets 95%+ of my computer needs, I am fine with that. I actually like using the mouse pad and can scroll easily with two fingers or move the mouse cursor with one. I do miss not having a delete key when editing. Page up and down buttons would be nice when scrolling too. I have not investigated the Google apps yet.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this and possibly other members of the Chromebook family for many users who mostly use the internet, email, etc and want a small, light simple to use PC. First, note your usage and needs to see if a Chromebook will work for you. I know Chromebooks may not be everyone's solution but may work well for many.<br/><br/>Pros:  boot and run speed<br/>  battery life<br/>  ease of setup/use<br/>  size/weight<br/>  value, features, performance, low purchase price<br/>  simple, fast Chrome operating system<br/>  available Google Chrome apps<br/>  clear display<br/>  USB ports and memory card slot<br/>  low chance of viruses/malware<br/>  no/automatic sw updates<br/>  no error messages<br/>  no bloatware<br/>  solid state hard drive<br/>  HDMI port for hdtv connection (must set Chromebook to mirror screen)<br/><br/>Cons: wifi only - no ethernet port<br/>  lack of delete and scroll up/down keys<br/>  won't run MS software such as office<br/>  no DVD/CD drive<br/>  not for high power use - gaming, photo editing, etc
Good value for the price. Upon start up, it went into what was shown as configuring tools and it seemed that was hung on that action/screen for quite sometime. The good old power down and up got over that and allowed me to configure and login. There is a scratch on the back side of the screen which is a turn off as this was going to be a gift to a relative.
Trackpad didn't work when I opened the box. Ordered a replacement, this time Chrome OS wasn't installed (or SSD was damaged). Won't be buying anything from Acer anytime soon. Yay for Amazon's return policy.
First, understand what it is that you are ordering. If you are into Google then this is for you, no pesky Microsoft software. Cheap, fast and good looking, I have no complaints about this product. Love it.
Probably only the second review I've ever written, but with a product this good, I can't help but provide my feedback.<br/>I purchased this Chromebook model for my mother from Best Buy and I've had a hard time letting it go.<br/><br/>The speed is phenomenal. Pages in chrome open and load lightning fast. Faster than my i7, 8GB RAM HP laptop. Startup is also extremely fast, whether from complete shutdown or just standby. I honestly can't fathom the speed of this thing. Thank you SSD.<br/><br/>Great buy for internet lovers; does all you need quickly. Email, browsing, streaming, YouTube, Netflix, hulu, and even some games.<br/><br/>Install a dual boot of Ubuntu alongside Chrome OS and you have an almost full laptop OS. You can't beat that price tag for this level of quality.<br/><br/>The Chromebook is also super lightweight. My 3 yr old niece can carry it like a spoon. I could hold it at arms length in a light grip and not feel any tiredness (OK, maybe a bit of an exaggeration, but its LIGHT).<br/><br/>Overall, I highly recommend this to light laptop users and even heavy internet users. I know I for one will be buying another just for myself. It's too good of a deal to pass up.
I love it because I bought it just $106. : )<br/>it's sound good<br/>and simple but if you wanted buy win OS sys, you should buy not crombook!<br/>It still don't work android app and must buy app in crom store.
I purchased this to replace the Toshiba Chromebook 2 HD. Many of you will ask why would I replace a chromebook with an IPS display with this one? Simple. While the Toshiba indeed has a great screen, 1080 for me on a 13 inch laptop is too much for my eyes. I have to scale everything up, so there was no real point in the bump in resolution. By downgrading I saved a good chunk of money and have a lighter weight better performing machine with better battery life.<br/><br/>The Acer performs better than the Toshiba Chromebook 2 and I suppose the reason for this is the difference in screen resolution. With the Acer, I am getting the rated 8.5 hours. With the Toshiba, I was only getting 6.5 hours tops. This is a well built machine, with good battery life, good performance and a decent screen. This is an overall much better machine than the C720.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>Light: At 2.4 pounds it is light weight<br/>Good build quality<br/>Decent Screen(much better than C720 and Asus C200<br/>Decent Sound and Volume<br/>Good Performance<br/>Good keyboard<br/>Great trackpad<br/>Battery life: 8.5 hours as advertised<br/><br/>Cons<br/>For $200 there really isn't any I have found. Could it perform a little better? Sure.
I was hesitant to buy a Chromebook when I looked at them last year.  Didn't think they would fit my needs.  But I was Wrong!  So glad I gave it a second chance.<br/><br/>I have an iPad.  I have a laptop.  I have a desktop. My job is 100% internet based as I work through a website and only need that and access to my email.  Working on my iPad was okay, but it was a slower process, especially not being able to have multiple tabs open, which I need for efficiency and I am a slave to a mouse, so I need that as well when I work.  Secondly I travel frequently and wanted something Lightweight as opposed to bringing my laptop with me.  I tried the Macbook Air, but having never been a Mac user, I could not grasp it.  The Chromebook fits the bill 100% for me.  It starts up in about 6 seconds and I had already used the  Chrome Browser so I was familiar with it and had set up my bookmarks, etc.on my desktop machine and my Chrome browser synced instantly with my desktop Chrome Browser.  Magic!!  I downloaded some essential business apps and have had no issues whatsoever using this Chromebook.  So glad I made this purchase.  Love Love Love it !
Research Chromebooks pretty extensively. Wanted something more than a tablet, less than a laptop.... and virus-resistant. Researched brands, and settled on the Acer Chromebook 11. Review were excellent. Everybody seems to like it, so I purchased it. Even paid way too much for 1-day shipping so I could take it with us for the weekend. Get it right away this morning. Out of the box. Plug it in... and..... (wait for it)....... "Google OS is damaged or missing. Install USB Recovery". What ?? It did give a website to go to for assistance, so I get on the desktop, go there, and start the "Chromebook Recovery" process. Oh, and before you try this.... you need at least 4GB thumb drive or SD card. the only thumb drive I could find laying around was 2GB.... so I stole one from my camera. Follow all the directions.... download, verify, write. Pretty clunky. Had to do it  three times to get a good download and get it to write to the media. It finally did, so after four hours of screwing with it, it finally booted. Will start using it and update this review later. So far, not incredibly impressed.
Our daughter's school computer doesn't come home over the summer, so we bought this one to bridge the gap.  It's perfect!  Just the right amount of computer for an 8th-grader!
I was a little on the ify side to purchase a chrome book after reading some reviews on them, but I am so glad I did. I use this thing for everything, It is so light weight that I carry it every where I go. I love that it doesn't have all that crap that I never use like a lap top does. I think everything from setting up your account to the cloud printing is super easy.  I love having the google calendar right at my finger tips. If you are thinking of purchasing one I say go for it!! The battery life is amazing too. I got almost six hours with out having to charge mine and that is with surfing online, listening to music and doing home school lesson plans and work. I was on the verge of purchasing a tablet for my 9 year old do some school work on but instead I am really thinking of getting her her own chrome book. They have great apps for learning to type , educational worksheets/apps. I really love mine.
Like several other folks, my Chromebook arrived with Chrome OS missing or damaged, but as long as you have an 4+GB SD card or USB drive, the fix is SO easy and only takes about 15 minutes. It was such a non-event, I almost forgot to mention it at all in my review.<br/><br/>So far, I love this little netbook. It's perfectly portable, boots up and shuts down FAST, and is super quiet. I do not miss the hum of my old laptop's fan at all! The battery seems to last forever. When I use it at home, I use a wireless mouse, external speakers, and a USB keyboard, but it works great on its own as well. I use it primarily for surfing the web and writing in Google Docs.<br/><br/>While this is a web-based laptop with limited functionality offline, the only things I've really missed are a Sonos app and the ability to sync to my iPhone. If not for those two things, I might never buy another Windows machine again.
Purchased as a replacement for a svelt 3.7lb Lenovo i5 ultrabook that my daughter badly abused by carrying in her college backpack without a sleeve or other protection.  After understanding there was no MacBook air in her future, I handed her this chromebook and told her to make the best of it -- along with a complete briefing on how to use google apps instead of Office, how to use cloud storage, and how to use a neoprene zippered case for transporting this 2.7lb device.  Amazingly, there were no complaints or questions - it just worked - with more than double the battery life and a pound lighter in her backpack.  What's more, after several weeks of use, she came home from college and had a weekend to try out an HP Stream 11 that offered win8.1, but after her trial, said she appreciated the simple, reliable chromebook and associated apps over win8.1 headaches.
I love this device.  For the price, I am extremely happy.  The processor doesn't allow for a lot of operations to occur at the same time, but I was just looking for something to browse Facebook, type blurbs when I feel like it, check e-mail, and browse the net.  I love the keyboard, it's super light, and the battery life is great.  I wasn't expecting a lightning fast experience at this price point, but it has exceeded my expectations.  I would recommend this for students who need a device to do basic research, or stay at home moms like myself who just want something to poke around on the internet.  I'm going to be taking this on an international trip to edit my photos with as well.  It has an SD card slot, and I'll be using the free Pixlr Editor.  After having a tablet for a while, I'm very happy to be back on a machine with a real keyboard for typing.
Extremely pleased! Typing this review from my CB3-111 right now. It does everything I ask of it; play music, watch videos, browse the web... Even as a computer power user, I'm rarely left wanting more from this thing. It doesn't replace my main computer by any stretch of the imagination, but as an extremely portable machine capable of being used for long periods of time (10 hours on the battery is laughably easy to do), it works like a charm, especially given the price point. I'd compare the CB3-111 to a tablet; that's certainly how I use mine much of the time. The bootup time with ChromeOS and the SSD is insane--practically the only reason that turning it on takes more time than just waking it from sleep is that you have to log in to your user account. This computer is excellent. I could not ask for more for my money.
I'm very happy----I like the keyboard better than my laptop. The touchpad is easier to use too although I will use a Logitech M570 trackball. I just ordered my third one!<br/>Set up was very easy, make sure to plug it in before turning it on, let it do its thing, answer a few questions and you're good to go. It is helpful if you already have a gmail account but you can sign up during the process.<br/>I downloaded the kindle app along with three books.<br/>This is a great machine at a terrific price.<br/>Thank you to the people that answered my question about the USB 3 being backwards compatible with USB2----I wanted to make sure I had at least one USB free since the trackball will use the other.<br/>This would be a great inexpensive machine for a student or for travel.<br/>Susan
I had all of my high techie people try to talk me out of buying one of these. I am SO glad I didn't listen. Yes. I still have my PC and I always will but this is what I use the majority of the time. I'd use it all the time but I've never gotten the hang of typing on a laptop-style keyboard [yes, I know I can dock a wireless keyboard to it but I have space issues where I use this to study] and to type the simplest thing takes me forever unless I'm in front of a regular keyboard. That's not the fault of the Chromebook. I guess if you are a big gamer or do a lot of Office sort of things then this wouldn't be for you. I use it for study, email, Facebook...all the usual. I leave my Office work at...work.  It's lightening fast and with 100 GB of storage in the Drive...it's all I need.
Perfect fit for my office at work. This chromebook will do so many cool things despite its limited access. Be aware do your research this is not a regular laptop or in other words it does not perform all the functions that a laptop does.The chromebook is a wonderful nifty tool to sit at my cubicle and be able to use all of googles functions which saves me a lot of walking! The screen is clear and has great resolution just make sure you tilt the screen to the correct angle. Yes this thing is limited to what it can do but for the money it's a very cool item!!!!! I love mine it arrived on time it was easy to set up; it runs very fast and picks up your local wifi very fast and will remember it after the first connection to it. I recommend it Acer is a good dependable machine
Wow. I am so surprised at how well this little thing runs. It's extremely portable and light.  The battery life is just incredible, and I'm getting 8 hours on it, and it is very liberating! I can take it anywhere and not worry about finding a power outlet.<br/><br/>I was worried that it was just too weak for my need (having only 2g ram, etc), but it turned out that it was good enough.  I have a specific need that is different than most users, as I use it for web app development, mostly in Linux (running Ruby on Rails, javascript and node.js, etc).  It was very easy to set it to run Linux (Debian) using Crouton app. Sure, it doesn't compare to my Macbook, but at its price, I couldn't care less.  I also got 1 TB of free Google Drive for couple of years, which is also very handy.
Nervously made the switch from a standard laptop to the chromebook... and I could not be happier about it!<br/>Lightweight, great battery life, starts up incredibly fast. I was nervous about not having the traditional Office suite, but between google docs and word online, I've been able to do everything I have needed to do - word processing, spreadsheets, presentations... have used and been happy with it all. I love using google drive as my main document storage and being able to access and edit from any computer! I also love that this little chromebook is inexpensive - makes me a lot less concerned about travelling with it and transporting it to work and back. {and if something did happen to it... what I need is stored on the cloud!}<br/>Happy camper!
This is a great computer!  It doesn't feel cheap, like I thought it would. I'm a convert!  For most everyday use, I like it better than the iPad.  Gasp!  It has a  great keyboard and is very sleek.  8 hrs of battery life. Supposedly you don't have to worry about updating it or viruses.  Updating is automatic. I bought it as a kitchen table machine for browsing, email and Facebook.  That is 95% of what we use computers for in this house (we don't game). I have a desktop for heavy lifting. A big plus over checking gmail on an iPad is that you can get the regular Gmail site and not the horrid grouped mobile gmail that you are required to use with iPads. (You can go the full site on the iPad but it is very cumbersome.) I recommend it.
Thank you to reviewers who write in,  soooo glad I listened to you. I don't leave many reviews.  I buy many devices and I am picky. But this is the best device I have purchased in a awhile. Just got today and paid $159, a big plus. Great size computer for portability and keyboard comfortable and very responsive. Worked right out of box with my wireless Wi-Fi, faster than older laptop. Very easy to get started and navigate. You must buy, you will not regret it. I will purchase another one if goes on sale again but worth $199...I just love getting a bargain and I finally got one. Thank you Amazon for fast delivery and great products.
Very happy with this device. I paid < $200 and I have to say I enjoy using it quite a bit. It is thin, light, wakes in half a second and handles 95% of computing tasks. It's plastic, but feels well made. The keyboard is a bit cramped, but is totally usable. Keypad is nicely responsive with a crisp click. The only build complaint is the cheesy power connector. It is thin and seems weak. I've been pleasantly surprised with the Chrome Web Apps available. Perfect for students or as a second (or third) machine. For the price I paid I don't see any reason for an iPad or other tablet for web/email and light computing. This is perfect.
Great little laptop for the right use cases.<br/>You don't buy a convertible Miata to haul gravel and you don't buy a pick-up truck to put the top down and cruise the Pacific Coast Highway.<br/><br/>This machine fits the bill great for me:<br/>- a 2nd machine to carry around the house<br/>- small light-weight travel laptop<br/>- loaner to let guests use to check their own email (guest mode login is neat)<br/><br/>Read the features and limitations. For most people this would not function as their primary machine (except perhaps for teenagers who are growing up with everything in the cloud). I'm impressed with it so far.
I was a bit hesitant getting this because of the "dead in box" reviews but i took the risk and bought this along with the insurance. my chromebook came in perfectly fine (85% charged)! it is extremely light (compared to my macbook pro) and is great for what it is, a basic laptop to do work/ surf the web.The battery life is great and I've had no issues with connecting to WIFI.  Google docs, spreadsheets, and slides are great substitutes for its windows based counterparts. I highly recommend this computer if you are looking for something easy to carry to get work done especially for students!
This is a great little computer. I bought it since my windows laptop died and need something to use to access the internet and stream multimedia through while the main desktop in my house was being used. This computer is easy to use, extremely light weight. And the battery lasts for 8--9 hours on one charge which is awesome. My only gripe is that in order to print from it, your printer must be a Google enabled printer, which mine isn't. But that's my only compliant, other than that I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an easy to use computer.
I love this laptop (or whatever you want to call it)!  It's soo fast, I barely ever plug it in, I never turn it off but the few times I have I can turn it back on in a flash.  Saving documents to google drive instead of to the hard drive takes some getting used to but ultimately is a good thing because now I can access my documents from any computer by logging into my google account.  It doesn't have microsoft office but the google versions of word, excel, etc work just fine so far for me.  I also love that it's super lightweight. Best purchase ever!
Thought an inexpensive computer wouldn't be that great but it is great! Light weight, long battery life, fast internet browsing, perfect for surfing the web or watching netflix, and loud speakers. Comes with a lot of storage space on Google Drive (Not on computer though).<br/><br/>I also though it might be hard to get used to a Chromebook, since I am familiar with Apple and Windows, but it is very simple. Highly recommended if you want an inexpensive beautiful computer for surfing the web, listening to music, or watching netflix.
Gotta say.....<br/>I had a 15" acer chromebook about a year ago. I traded it in for a 11" acer windows laptop, mostly for printer compatibility.<br/>That was the worst mistake I made! I hate the windows laptop! I am trying to sell it now, lol! I bought this 11" chromebook and literally...it is ready to go right out of the package. They are so user-friendly and I LOOOOVE it. Even with slow internet, this laptop still does it's business.<br/><br/>That's what this machine really is, an internet machine. And I love it!
I could not be happier with this purchase! For the price I assumed there would be some serious things that it lacked, but I have yet to find any.  The battery life and boot-up time are incredibly fast and Google Documents are just as effective when it comes to schoolwork as Microsoft Office.  I highly recommend this product for people who are looking for a computer to browse the web, video chat, or do simple tasks.  I also was given 1 TB of cloud storage with my purchase which is an amount I will never reach.  Great product.
Good notebook and good price. I bought it for my mom (84) and she just loves it.  All I had to do was nag her a little bit about turning it All the way off. You need to hold down the off key until the little light at the top back of the base (easily seen from front) goes out.  The added attraction to me, is that you can keep it plugged in while you watch movies and it will not run down the battery.  Good size and light, but seems well made and sturdy.<br/>All in all, a good little machine.
I purchased this li'l guy to bring along on a motorcycle tour to handle my photo and video files while on the road. I needed a way to transfer files from my cameras to an external hard drive, my requirements were simple: an SD card reader and at least one USB 3.0 drive. This model met all of the criteria, had good reviews and was lightweight enough to fly across the world with me (and for $150 bucks it wasn't a huge investment), so I pulled the trigger and bought it.<br/><br/>After using it for a few weeks here are my impressions:<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>-This little compy starts up quickly and functions surprisingly well for almost any web-based work you might need.<br/>- It's very easy to dual boot with Ubunutu (don't do this unless you know what you're getting into)<br/>- Just enough ports to handle almost basic file management for photography and video.<br/>- $150<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>The only big problem I have with compy is a pretty big one: the color calibration on the built-in screen is pretty terrible. The computer has a very strong bluish tone to it and very shallow color contrast, as a result, nothing on this monitor is even close to the color's you'd find on a more accurate display. Unfortunately this is a feature shared by almost all 11" Chromebooks. This was almost a deal breaker for me, my entire decision to purchase this computer was as a way to manage and edit photographs while on the road, without an accurate screen I am playing guess work with the color balance, tint, and saturation of every photo I'd edit on this platform. I've managed to work around this by using my phone's screen to check colors, but it's a messy workaround. Even using the color calibration tools in Ubuntu didn't manage to fix the problem. For my photo work, I now only it to transfer files.<br/><br/>OVERALL:<br/><br/>Despite the poor color calibration, I use this computer for 95% of my humdrum computer needs. As a result my MacBook Pro sits on my desk more and more. The chromebook boots up faster and functions more smoothly while browsing, just don't expect to use it for any design/photography needs.
I must say those looking at Chromebooks should keep their expectations in check. If you have the right scope of what they can do as a computing device you will be very satisfied with your purchase. If you think it will replace your 6 year old Windows laptop it might be able to if the work you do is mostly web dependent.<br/><br/>What is a Chromebook to begin with? A Chromebook is a laptop that runs Google's ChromeOS for its Operating System. ChromeOS is a light weight OS based on Linux. The OS is essentially just a Chrome browser, so whatever you can do on Chrome in Windows or Mac you can do on a Chromebook.<br/><br/>When I looked at Chromebooks when they first came out I didn't see the appeal of them. I thought they would be never be a device I would want to buy. I was wrong. It turns out Chromebooks can do many things, you just need to list out what they can do, and you need to be happy with their strengths and not worry about their weaknesses.<br/><br/>Things you can do on a Chromebook:<br/><br/>1. Listen to Spotify<br/>2. Check your Email<br/>3. Watch Netflix<br/>4. Write up a document using Google Docs<br/>5. Create a spreadsheet in Google Docs<br/>6. Go on YouTube<br/>7. Browse Amazon and buy stuff<br/>8. Do simple math using the Calculator app<br/>9. Play Flash games<br/>10. Browse ANY website that supports Chrome<br/>11. The list goes on and on, but these are some things that many people do on a daily basis<br/><br/>Things you can't do / can't do well:<br/><br/>1. Edit photos<br/>2. Play video games like League of Legends or Starcraft II<br/>3. Run Quickbooks or any other office application that needs to be installed on the machine<br/>4. Adobe Creative Cloud software is not supported for Chromebooks<br/><br/>So as you can see Chromebooks can do a lot of things computing wise. If the things they can do hits all your check boxes then one might be for you.<br/><br/>I really like the Acer CB3-111-C670 with it's white matte finish and black keyboard. The color combination is reminiscent of Apple's old Macbook design, but it is done really well here by Acer. The keyboard and track pad are solid here. They are responsive and the keyboard has a nice tactile feedback and depression with its keys. The track pad is a smooth matte white and also feels great to use.<br/><br/>Chromebooks in general are really fast, but this Chromebook boots up in 10 seconds, literally! It also wakes up in less than 3 seconds, so Chromebooks are fast, very fast. Overall, the OS is snappy and I didn't see any hick ups opening up 4 or 5 tabs at once.<br/><br/>The Acer CB3 is light weighing in at just over 2.5 lbs, which puts it just a hair heavier than an 11.6 inch Macbook Air. This thing is great to use because of its light weight. I also like the screen it's pretty good and the viewing angles aren't terrible on it considering it's a TN panel. The screen itself has a matte finish which does a decent job of reducing window glare.<br/><br/>Acer opted to put an Intel Celeron N2830 into this Chromebook. Many reviewers will say it's not as fast as previous Chromebooks with higher-end processors, but the N2830 is great for several reasons. Even though on paper the N2830 is not as fast as it's predecessors it is better in two ways:<br/>first it consumes less power and second it is completely silent! That's right, the N2830 is fan less, so you won't here a thing while the Chromebook is on, which is a touch. Lastly, the battery life is crazy on this machine. I get about 8 hours of run time on a single charge!!!<br/><br/>If you need a laptop to take notes, check email, listen to music, stream TV show and Movies, then a Chromebook is ideal for you. If you think it can be your primary computer, it can given the right set of applications you need it to run. For me, I use it on the weekends instead of my work laptop for browsing and checking email. I like it a lot and the price was just right when I bought it, which was $139.<br/><br/>In a nutshell Chromebooks in general are inexpensive, fast, and can do most things a Windows laptop can do.
I am just an average Tech Junkie.  Love new things and research them to death.  I bought 2 of these, one for college child and one for me.  Was looking for something lightweight, compact, able to stream to TV, and dependable.  Acer products first of all are on the whole dependable.  I was waiting for ASUS 4gb ram price to hit my buy point as had fears of 2gb ram hindering the video portion.  I daily, and hourly would watch the prices of my targeted models and, Sorry Amazon, had to go elsewhere because price of this was better than I expected. ANyway, the review,<br/> First 2 gb vs 4 gb of ram.  For our purposes, doesn't matter.  Open up multiple tabs and stream more than one movie and music simultaneously and you might experience lag.  But for my purpose of one video at a time it has been great.  My child has had 5 windows open, listening to music and has been able to browse on the 5 with no lag.<br/>Speakers on the system are functional for listening to, but if for music this is bought, then do what we do.  With the much appreciated Bluetooth capabilities, we just pair them to our Bose Soundlink system and have the quality of audio we appreciate.  The keyboard keys are responsive, the touchpad a little too finicky out of the box but easliy remedied in settings. Anyway, will eventually get bluetooth mouse.  Feature I love is that this thing is instantly on, no boot time.  The display is adequate, not HD but who cares for everday use?  The Chrome operating system is moot point for complainers.  Don't care about not having Word or other MS office products...could download the app but will use Google Docs.<br/>PORTABILITY:  wow, light as a feather, fits in daughter's purse for cross campus walks.  Will be much more convenient for me to carry through airports than my old lenovo laptop which is still very windows 7 functional.<br/>THE CON...my only, and I mean only wish was that we had access to Google play store app and not the supplied version.  Not a deal breaker but<br/>just a wish.<br/>RECOMMEND.  All being said, I recommend this for the average guy.  Don't ask me about gaming or photoshopping, or other beyond basic functions, this machine is highly recommended by me for the portabilty and ability to do basic day to day computer functions at a price that can't be beat.
Complaints are usually the order of the day, so ... . First, this machine is compact and light, which is one reason I bought it. I don't really notice it in my backpack, which I can't say about my Asus laptop. This Chromebook comes with a USB 3 and a USB 2 and an SD card reader. I regularly use the USB 3 port with a 64GB USB flash drive where I store music and files I need and it works well. The keyboard is responsive and big enough for me although I often hit the <enter> key instead of the single quote. I was (and probably still am) unfamiliar with Chromebooks in general, so I've done some looking for things like keyboard shortcuts and the like (<alt><backspace> for delete is one example). The touchpad works well. I usually disable them on laptops and only use an attached mouse, but I am comfortable using this one (although I do often use a Bluetooth mouse for spreadsheet work and the like). The battery typically lasts 6.5 to 7 hours with WiFi connected, Bluetooth active and listening to music while I work, so that's a big plus. WiFi generally connects easily and efficiently and so far I've had no problems. So far, so good. Now the complaints. Bluetooth often drops the signal, but even that's just annoying. The truly maddening problem is (I'm guessing) the 2GB of RAM. I'm a researcher and do a lot of quantitative work. I've found Google Sheets and Docs to be a little to "lite" for what I need, but MS Office 365 (or Live - whatever they call it) works better. The problem is that with a few Chrome windows open with a just few tabs each, moving from one tab to another essentially requires the tab to be reloaded. I might be switching from a spreadsheet to a Word doc, to OneDrive, to Gmail and one or more seems to have been bumped out of RAM. Frustrating. I think I would go for a model with more RAM and see if that helps with this performance issue. The nice thing about Chromebooks in general is that the cloud is developing so that I can do just about everything I need using the Chromebook. I mentioned MS Office 365, there are online LaTex editors, one can use R through Amazon Web Services, so I can do just about anything I might do with an ordinary laptop - just a little less conveniently, but with a much more portable form factor. Overall, Chromebooks over great value. Depending on what you do with it, this model may be all you need.
I had a 5-year-old HP laptop from college at death's door and needed a change. Did my research and was realistic about my budget and knew I just needed a simple computer for personal use (blogging, Netflix, writing, online shopping, reading articles, emailing). I'm really happy with what I got for a very low price.<br/><br/>Purchased it in April, here are the highlights:<br/>-Can't beat the ridiculous battery life, it actually does last all day. Charges very quickly too.<br/>-Ten tabs open -- no problem. This thing is beastly fast because it has nothing extra slowing it down.<br/>-Webcam quality is quite nice. Have had some hassle-free Hangouts with my family.<br/>-Googling Chrome apps and plugins usually turns up some satisfactory stand-in for old PC software functions that work fine enough for me.<br/>-Stays cool, doesn't give me that terrible laptop thigh burn! Haha.<br/>-Really light! I stow it in my backpack and notice no weight difference.<br/>-Biggest selling point: feels, acts and looks like a much more expensive computer. The keyboard has the PERFECT feel -- light touch, not too clicky (reminds me of a Mac) and the plastic casing feels really premium. Screen isn't flimsy, and the brightness is surprisingly powerful.<br/>-Runner-up selling point: awesome, awesome speakers. I use my laptop mostly for listening to music, movies and podcasts, and the sound is consistently clear, not tinny or cheap at all (much better quality than any laptop I've ever used before).<br/><br/>This Chromebook is simple and reliable and I love it quite a lot. It probably isn't the best move for a college student or designer who relies on software heavily, but for everyone else in the world, esp people not rolling around in money, I can't imagine you being unhappy with this delightful device.
Ok, so I did have to do a recovery of the Chrome operating system, right out of the box.  However, I have to say that the whole process was actually an unexpected pleasure.  Not only was the computer left fully functional when I completed the simple system image restore, I learned a valuable task that could come in handy in the future.  For sure, Google made a scary situation as easy to resolve as anything I could have hoped for.<br/><br/>I chose the Acer Chromebook 11 CB3-111-C670 for my wife, based on reviews and knowing accurately what her wants and needs were.  For sure, PRICE was major motivator as well.  Thankfully, she is delighted with the browser-centric functionality of Chrome.  She warmed up to this more-than-adequate information resource that can sit next to her sewing machine as she works through her projects.<br/><br/>Though we both have Windows 'puters, and Android phones/tablets, we got our minds around Google's Chrome in a fraction of the time and effort that any other device had required.  I know that Windows 10 is nearing release, and many tech bloggers are predicting that Microsoft will rule.  Well, maybe so, but we will simply enjoy what we currently have...and root for Google to keep up the good work with Chrome.  Certainly, there is plenty of room for Linux, Chrome and Windows.  They all have finer points to brag about.<br/><br/>As for Acer's hardware...<br/><br/>We made a very good choice, that's for sure.  The whole Chrome experience has been made a slam-dunk by Acer, as their product works seamlessly with every one of the default Chrome apps, and everything we've added from the Chrome Store.  The keyboard suits my wife just fine, and the display is perfect now that I've bumped the resolution down to 1024.  The now larger fonts are much easier on her eyes.  A white bluetooth mouse by Samsung (search Amazon for the ASIN number: B00IUXAS6K) rounds out the package.  She loves this little Chromebook, and that definitely scores me some rare, major points!  ;o)
I have had my Chromebook for about 2 weeks now.  I found it at an excellent price and so bought it to serve as a "supplemental" computer for our household.  We have another laptop which runs Windows OS.  The Chromebook will be used for checking email, surfing the web, creating "basic" documents (word processing and spreadsheets), and streaming an occasional movie. I am also taking a class so may try taking it to class with me and taking computer notes.  It is fabulous for these purposes.  Operation seems plenty fast for these needs.  It is very easy to use and extremely lightweight.  I already had a google/gmail account so ... just open it up and start using ... which is a big plus.  I love that it is instantly on when I open it up.  The battery life is great.  I ran it almost all day one time and was shocked to look for the cord and find that it was not plugged in.  I sought out an Acer product because I have been very happy with the other Acer computer I own.  We are proficient users of computer/technology products but not "techies."  The limitations I have some concerns about:  1) limited on-device data storage - I am hoping that with the "cloud" and another computer at home, this will be a non-issue.  I think I will have to live with this limitation for a while to be sure.  and 2) Printing limitations - we do not have a wifi printer at present.  I am hoping that this will not be a problem given that we have another computer we can use for printing - but it is a concern.  Because of these + the inability to run a few more specialized pieces of software we need, I would not yet be ready to commit to being a Chromebook-only household but as a supplementary device for mostly web-based applications, it is an excellent, cost effective choice.
This is a very nice little computer for the price. It's surprisingly capable to handle many tabs with typical applications such as gmail, facebook and google docs. It's light and doesn't look bad, and battery life is good.<br/><br/>It's important to keep in mind that the free 100GB of cloud storage are not allocated to your account automatically upon log in. Read the leaflet that comes with the computer to find out how to do it, as it adds a lot of value to it.<br/><br/>Making a silly comparison to a Macbook Air (the computer I'm coming from, and widely regarded as one of the most well-rounded notebooks available), it is amazing how little I feel I've lost. My usage is basically only chrome, so that may partly explain this feeling. The construction of this computer is nice, it feels solid and well put together. Of course it's plastic and Acer hasn't tried to hide the seams as Apple does, but the design is nice overall. From an aesthetics point of view, I just wish Acer's logo wasn't this ugly, as it kind of ruins the hardware's minimalistic design. The track pad doesn't have as nice a texture and it rattles a bit, but it tracks my finger reasonably well and much better than many computers with MS Windows. The keyboard is not as nice as the Macbook's (it's highest point) and it's not backlit, but it's perfectly capable and not annoying to use at all. The screen is not great either, but that is easily explained buy the price point.<br/><br/>I've also found myself really enjoying the chromebook-specific versions of some of google's apps, such as photos or keep. For this computer to be really useful, it's important that you're completely into google's ecosystem. That's where the hardware and the software come together very nicely.<br/><br/>If acer made a version of this computer with no logos and an IPS screen (and maybe twice the ram and storage) it would have a hit in its hands.
I got this computer on sale for 159. I have to say this is the best electronics purchase I have ever made. I love the OS and even if I didn't I could install another one on it. I love the look of it. It reminds me of my old macbook. I like it more than my old macbook though because of the size and lightness. I have had no problems with it since starting it up. The battery life is amazing. I've gotten 11 hours out of this computer and it recharges super fast. I use it more than my HP Envy which is getting lonely. I also got 1TB of cloud storage from google for 2 years which pretty much paid for my laptop. I can't praise this device enough. I wish I could use it at work honestly. It also has the fastest boot up of any computer I've ever used. I open it and it's ready to go. I also don't really need to worry that much about viruses which is nice. I think anyone looking for a solid user experience with a simple and clean os should look at this computer. It's really a gem.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I'd pair this computer with WD My Passport Ultra (which works because you don't need drivers for it) or a USB memory stick or an SD. I know that kind of defeats the purpose of cloud driven computing which is primarily what the chromebook is for but I have had nothing but trouble with the cloud that google provides. My movies are not immediately viewable on the cloud. They take forever (if at all) to process to be viewable. I have never had a movie process so I don't know if it works. I have deleted things only to have them appear momentarily and then disappear. Let's not even talk about my music. It's just been a weird experience. I caved and bought the WD My Passport Ultra from target for cheap and it's been a godsend. I only use the cloud for my docs now and even then I think I will primarily use the Microsoft Office online (which is free and has 15 GB free from their drive) because I have run into weird formatting issues in googledoc when converting into a word document. Even though I love my chromebook the cloud driven experience has been awful and frustrating ultimately. Sorry google.
This is a really great little machine.<br/><br/>I am a pretty dedicated Apple user. I've been using Mac for about 12 years now, and absolutely despise using Windows based machines. However, the downside to Apple products has always been the prices.<br/><br/>After my beloved Macbook bit the dust a few months ago, I had to find a replacement. Being on a tight budget, I knew it would take me a while to save up for a new Mac, so I started looking through some affordable options to get me by, allowing me to do basic internet and computer tasks. I had never really thought about or considered a Chromebook, but I knew I would be unhappy with a regular PC, and the reviews were great, so I decided to give it a shot. I am so glad I did!<br/><br/>The Chrome OS IS different, but I think it is a pretty easy transition from Mac to Chrome. It's simple to use and runs smoothly. Everything I hate about Windows is missing, and I can accomplish just about everything I need to pretty easily.<br/><br/>I love that it runs silently, and that it starts up almost instantly. The keyboard is nice, very similar to the one I'm used to, and I like the trackpad - being used to a multi-touch trackpad on my Macbook, this one is familiar and welcome, and I much prefer it to buttons! The screen is nice - a good brightness and I like the matte finish.<br/><br/>Pages load pretty quickly and I can open multiple tabs without issues.<br/><br/>The speakers sound surprisingly good, given the size! I was impressed with that.<br/><br/>My only complaints are that I wish I could use Skype and iTunes. Google Play Music is fine and I do like it, I just wish I could access all of the music I have in the iTunes cloud! Skype is my preferred messenger, and you can access the web version of it for chatting, but I'd like the functionality of an app.<br/><br/>Those are very minor complaints, though, and I see myself using this Chromebook for it's portability even after I replace my full computer. I definitely recommend it to anyone who needs a simple, functional way to use the internet!
Was concerned that I would find this a joke after using Windows based PC and Notebooks for years but after only a short time with it, I find it does everything I need for on-line use and can use it at will staying off the desktop when full system and Windows features are not needed.<br/><br/>Pretty well done and so far have found no reason to worry about virus and Malware protection like my other systems.<br/>Boot it up and shut it down as I please without running other security programs etc.<br/>(will this change in the future if Chrome OS gets larger user base and more hackers get involved?  Who knows.. seems a certainty for the times to me)<br/><br/>I've used USB 2 & 3 memory sticks and an external Seagate USB3 HDD with this so far without any problems.<br/><br/>Touch pad is best feel & action I've found so far on a Notebook I've used, several options for it in the settings you will want to check on.  For me, I had to reset it to be less touchy.<br/><br/>One finger push same as left mouse click, two finger push is same as right mouse click.  one finger swipes moves cursor, two finger swipes will scroll up and down the pages.  Three finger swipe left or right to change open tabs...<br/><br/>True, if you are used to Windows based machines you will find a few items about the keyboard that are different when you go to use them, but really nothing that can't be looked up and used when you are on the ChromeBook keyboard.<br/>I found the best thing for me was to use the "?" help key and go to the page that shows keyboard use, then save that page to the bookmark bar at the top of the browser page..  then it's quick and easy to click that to get fast info on what key combos do what with this CB3.<br/>Or if you want to see full screen keyboard overlay showing key assignments you can use Ctrl+Alt+? for that pop up<br/><br/>I have yet to find any problem with computing power or speed with this CB3, it's quite impressive even when used to more powerful computers.  But then keep in mind that you are not running anything that requires much of the system either.  No software that need lots of CPU or video card power.<br/><br/>WiFi connection has been fast and flawless so far...  one thing to keep in mind when reading about the super fast WiFi this has...  the fastest communications is with the new "A C" that this is capable of..  but, you also have to have one of the new "AC" capable routers to enjoy the full speed available to you with this ChromeBook version.  Fully backward compatible with older routers, but just not at the cutting edge speeds they offer in product description.<br/><br/>The only thing I've found so far that I wish was different is that the screen has somewhat limited viewing angles and on this one, I have to have the screen tilted a bit away from me at the top to see it properly for my eye.  Also it's a bit "blue" in it's white balance and could use a touch of red.<br/>Sorry to say, you can change the brightness of the screen and resolution, but you can not get in there and change the color settings.<br/>Maximum screen resolution is 1366 x 768<br/><br/>Battery really does last a long time and then charges very fast as well.<br/><br/>Battery pack is not removable, memory is not expandable , SSD can't be increased in size  (by the average person at least)  After warranty period is up I'll have to look into that however.  IF I find it would be needed...  right now, can't see any use in wanting more of anything for what it was intended for.<br/><br/>You might want to look at the rest of the Acer Chromebook line if you do desire more up front, but you soon leave that lower price sweet spot this version offers and head more towards a full blown Notebook price.<br/>For example;<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>I have had computers since the '80s buy I have never owned an Acer product before, but do know the brand has been around for a very long time, if this has been built by Acer,(not just branded) they have done well with the case,keyboard and screen which is all I can see and touch.<br/>  Only exception to that is the touch pad, the bottom left is down in the case a bit more than the other three corners (1/16 ish) so that you can feel the lip of the plastic case there.  Still works fine, just rubs your fingers when used and will sure be the dirt collection point on white case and pad.<br/><br/>No way to know what the motherboard looks like so can't comment on soldering or internal build other than it works well now and has some good Intel components in use.<br/><br/>Update 2/2015;<br/><br/>Used every day with no problems at all, working well and has not given a hint of trouble so far.<br/><br/>Only two items I wish it had so far,  a bit of a plastic tab at the center edge of the lid to make it easier to open from the center, don't think it's a good idea to open from the corners and twist the lid/screen frame.<br/><br/>Also really wish it had a HD camera facing outward (where you are looking) in the top so you could take photos like you can  with a tablet or phone.<br/><br/>Alt + backspace will get you "delete" action<br/><br/>See other key toggles when you hit Ctrl+ Alt + ?<br/><br/>Be sure to understand this uses Chrome operating system and does not use any Windows or Mac software.  Also note there is a difference between Chrome OS and Chrome browser, so something made for Windows Chrome "Browser" is not for Chrome OS etc.
Hubs and I decided to get the kids computers last Christmas, and finally determined that Chromebooks would serve our budget and still provide everything they needed to do their schoolwork. Since they use Google Docs and Google Classroom at school, it was a perfect fit! Kids love them. I love how fast they are with no wasted boot up time. Set up was easy - except for connecting to our wifi. I kept getting one of two error messages, and since it was on both computers, I figured we didn't just have a defective one.  I decided to reboot our router, and then they connected just fine, until the next day - when we'd have to reboot the router again. I tried different settings on the router, searched the Web for software updates for my router, and then called in my brother who is an IT guru (although Chromebooks are not his area of expertise.) I was stuck with the rebooting workaround. I decided that I needed to find a new router, but wasn't sure what to look for because I didn't know exactly what the problem was with the one I had (all of our other devices connect just fine.) I was shopping for something else when I happened upon a travel router ( http://www.amazon.com/TP-LINK-TL-WR702N-Wireless-Repeater-150Mpbs/dp/B007PTCFFW/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1427829301&sr;=8-2&keywords;=travel+router ) and figured that for under twenty bucks, I'd give it a try and if it didn't work for this then I'd find another use for it. I connected it to my main router, set up a new network, and connected the Chromebooks to the network. Voila - no more wifi connection issues! Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase and would purchase the same again.
Perfect for my needs, light weight, long battery life, excellent wifi range and important to me - a USB mouse works without a glitch (I hate trackpads).  Boots instantly and charges quickly.  My real laptop never comes out of the case anymore.
This is by far my favorite laptop. I just want to point out some suggested improvements, I hope Acer reads this<br/>1. Built quality is great, light and sturdy is an excellent combination, but the trackpad feels a little loose and flimsy, which is unfortunate since everything in this laptop feels well made. I wish chromebooks would get rid of the click mechanism in their trackpads and simply go for tap and touch. Clicking is unreliable and unnecessary. The mouse movement on the trackpad is the best I've experienced in any laptop (excluding Apple)<br/>2. The dimension of the laptop is excellent, BUT it would've been even better if the screen had less bezels, the keyboard and trackpad would be crammed you say? well you could go for a 16:10 ratio, then you would have more space for the track-pad and keyboard in a smaller device.<br/>3. Again the 16:9 ratio is not so good for small screens, anything below 12 inches should be at least 16:10<br/>4. Resolution is decent enough, at 135 ppi the screen is pretty crisp, BUT the standard TFT panel is just too outdated and looks washed out, I know it is a more efficient technology, but i wouldn't mind losing an hour of battery life for a superior screen. I have a 100 ppi IPS panel that I use for my desktop and it looks A LOT better, all in all I believe a 1280x800 IPS 12 inch screen would've been a better screen for this device even if that were only 125 ppi.<br/><br/>All in all one AMAZING laptop, I wish Acer would build a product that is even smaller and lighter. Highly recommended.
I am not a tech-y person and really only needed something to do basics like email, surf the internet, edit some google docs, etc. This is perfect. Light weight, long battery, great price. If you just need basic functions, highly recommend!
I bought this after much investigation of exactly what it was actually. After figuring out it is Chrome browser in a box I decided to take a chance. I'm glad I did, especially after finding out that I could install ubuntu linux on it, this is huge. The fact is that although Chrome has it's limits, because after all it's just a browser, the fact that you can install a full blown Linux operating system on it removes those limitations. Now due to the limitations of the small 16g drive space you of course can't install all the Linux programs one would have on a full blown computer, but you can install the programs you use the most. I can ssh into my main computer or into my media server and setup the programs or movies I want to stream to the roku and play using plex. Yes sir, if you are  linux geek this is the laptop to get, especially for sittin' on the couch stuff. lol. I am a Slackware guy but Ubuntu is easy enough to learn for any Linux lover and you can install it easily using Crouton Ubuntu installer. Crouton was created by a Chrome OS employee and works like a charm. You can swap between Chrome OS and Ubuntu Linux with the following key strokes: ctl/shift/alt/right arrow and c/s/a/left arrow, the arrows in the top row not on the keypad. The documentation says " with an intel processor you swap with c/a/arrow" but on this one that is not true, it is c/s/a/arrow.  For a 150 buck Linux laptop, you can't go wrong. Get it. BTW, I bought this from best buy because they had it on sale 10 bucks cheaper.
I use this mostly for work.  I teach and our District is really moving towards Google  (finally), so I went out and got this.  It does everything I need it to do.  Mostly Docs and Office 365.  Speedy,  fast,  and battery lasts forever.
My wife isn't very techy, and she mainly uses a computer to check the kid's school websites, news, or other online content.  She had an older Asus netbook with 1 gig of RAM running a Windows 7 starting pack.  It was very sluggish, constantly updating Windows, and had a lot of software she never used.  I wiped the operating system and loaded it with Ubuntu OS and it worked really well as a stripped down computer just for web browsing.  That was, until a whole cup of water was dumped on it!  :-(  When looking for a replacement I considered an Android tablet, but she really wanted a keyboard.  I considered getting the Tablet and adding a bluetooth keyboard, but after looking int Chromebooks I realized it is really what she was looking for.  A laptop feel with keyboard, but mainly geared towards web browsing WITHOUT Microsoft Windows OS.  If all you are looking for is a device for web browsing that includes a keyboard, this is the perfect choice.  She has had it for about a month now and is very pleased.  I never get the questions "Do I make this update?" or "Why is it taking so long to open this web page?"  It boots up extremely fast, battery life has been really good, and it is very light weight with a good screen size.  When I purchased it, it was on sale for $150.  I don't think I could have done any better getting what I wanted for that price.  Current price I believe is $199 which is still very much worth the buy in my opinion.
Works perfectly, good trade off between performances and price. The interface is very responsive, pages load quickly enough and I can use all the online applications that I need without glitches. Very satisfied with it.
Just got it won't charge ...charger doesn't fit falls out
I bought this Chromebook on a whim. And I have to say, I think it's one of the best purchases I've made in a while.<br/><br/>I'm a freelance web designer and developer, and often have to meet with clients in their places of business. Where a lot of what I do at meetings (display my portfolio, teach clients how to use control panels, etc.) is done online, this is perfect. Smaller than my laptop, it fits in my bags easily, and the battery life is fantastic - I can easily get 7-8 hours on a single charge. While ChromeOS isn't really suited to development, you can easily dual-boot Linux or use a cloud IDE.<br/><br/>As far as the hardware goes; I'm impressed. The plastic doesn't feel overly cheap. The keyboard is spaced-out nicely and easy to type on. The touchpad is smooth and responsive, and the speakers are great - better than the ones on my other laptop. My only qualm is that the matte screen can be hard to read if you have a bad glare.<br/><br/>Okay - it does bother me a little that it doesn't have a Delete key. Mostly because I use it a lot when I'm coding. The average, everyday user isn't likely to miss it.<br/><br/>All things considered, I'd definitely recommend this to a friend. It's light, speedy, and portable, runs well, and has a myriad of uses, from checking your email or Facebook to running Linux and putting it to work.
This laptop is fun to use.  Very lightweight and VERY FAST!  I'm so tired of waiting for my Windows based laptops to load pages.  True, they are at least 3 years old and probably need a good cleaning out, but this laptop's speed makes me love it.  Also, it will probably stay that way as so much of the Chrome based data is stored in the cloud.  It's also pleasant to use - good-feeling silent keyboard and truly comfortable on your lap as it weighs so little.  Keyboard is a bit different than a Windows based one so it takes a bit of getting used to, but the feel of the keys and the layout of the keyboard are fine.  Also, some of the keys in the top row are very useful including easy ways to adjust screen brightness, volume and text size.  Many YouTube videos explain how Chromebook works compared to Windows based computers.  I use it for internet browsing, investing including Marketsmith (great charting service), email, music (Rhapsody), Kindle Chromebook app, Netflix, YouTube, etc.  Speakers not bad but I use a small exterior speaker and it connects by bluetooth.  I'm not a gamer.  So far I haven't been able to get it to connect to my old printer so I may need to get<br/>a newer printer, but I use my older Windows based laptop for this.  Very good value and I can see why it is a top seller on Amazon - which was one big reason I bought it.
I like this device pretty well.  It's currently listed at $199, but I ordered it two days ago at $157!  Lucky me.  After testing the Samsung Chromebook (1st one), I ordered this CB3 model because it had the same specs as the Samsung, which was more expensive.<br/>*Please give positive feedback if this review is helpful* And feel free to comment with questions.<br/><br/>COMPARISON between the Samsung and this Acer:<br/>SCREEN - Samsung screen was nicer (smoother).  Both are anti-glare (matte) and have acceptable viewing angles, but the Acer is much more "textured" and picks up dust/smudges more easily.  Both have nice bright displays (the default is something like 70% brightness every time I turn on each unit, and a couple bumps of the brightness button brings it right up--honestly, 70% is pretty good and I don't notice half the time).<br/>KEYBOARD - Both feel great.  Short stroke with positive "snap" for fast and confident typing. Keyboards are VERY similar.  The "Function" keys along the top are handy (they're not dual-purpose--you just press them, without having to hold CTRL, or Fn, etc).  I heavily use the Home, End, and Delete buttons normally, and the fact that they aren't included on these devices is frustrating, since it slows my editing down.<br/>MOUSE - Good feel on both devices.  It's a click-pad style, so if you want to right-click, you just tap with 2 fingers at the same time--simple enough.  I have also used a USB mouse without any issue.  It picks up immediately, with full functionality.  Due to the small size of the unit, I occasionally accidentally click the pad or move the cursor with the base of my thumbs, but it's rare and not a big deal.<br/>I'd also like to point out that in the Settings, you can change the mouse 2-finger scrolling from "normal" to "Australian".  This setting determines which way the page scrolls for your 2-finger up/down dragging.<br/>AUDIO - Big difference here.  The Samsung wins--no competition.  Both units get decent volume, but the sound quality from the Samsung is much greater--not that it's like my Bose Soundlink III, but it does quite well, and feels "full".  The Acer is very tinny and sounds cheap.<br/>WEIGHT - Both units are lightweight.  Difference is minimal.<br/>PERFORMANCE - Similar. Nothing noticeably different.<br/>BATTERY - Similar.  Both last 4-8+ hours.  I've watched >2hrs on Netflix on battery and the units are only warm, and used ~30% battery.<br/>WEBCAM - Didn't test to compare.  I don't expect much out of these anyway.<br/><br/>CHROME OS - There's nothing to it, really.  If you use Chrome on another computer and are signed into Chrome (not just to your Google account on a webpage--signed in to CHROME), then the experience is identical, minus other programs.  If my company didn't want me to use MS Office and Outlook (and if I didn't play Skyrim), I'd use one of these instead of my laptop for just about everything.
I suffer from a serious neurotic problem where I must compulsively check in online with the Amazon Vine program at ridiculously  short intervals to see if they are offering me any free computer equipment to review, which up to now has kept me tied to my desktop PC's. My boss at work has already hired a potential replacement for me, and besides neglecting so much housework and automotive maintenance at home, I was spending WAY too much money on adult diapers.<br/><br/>Thank goodness Amazon Vine provided me with this lightweight portable Acer Chromebook 11 to review.<br/><br/>For $200 this unit is amazing. My only previous experience along these lines was a little Acer netbook running Windows XP that I bought back in early 2009. I paid $250 for that and all I can say is it was slow to boot up and  painfully, mind-numbingly slow on the internet. Now I flip this Chromebook open and in about 10 seconds I can be on the internet checking for Vine freebies. It comes fully on darn near instantly, then navigates the internet from there as quickly as any computer I ever used. It links up with the wifi at my home or my dad's place with no issues whatsoever, so now I'm free to roam around the house and use the toilet or eat in the kitchen with my wife and kids or whatever. The battery life is longer than any rechargeable device of any kind I've ever owned or used... I turn it on and off, on and off, and basically it lasts all day long. I also note that this thing has no air vents anywhere yet stays amazingly cool at all times. My old netbook felt like it was going to catch on fire if I ever set it down on my bed for 5 minutes while on. This Chromebook also has entirely acceptable, if not great, speakers and a very nice keyboard feel. I only use it for browsing the internet, watching YouTube videos, and checking my e-mail, so I can't comment on any word-processing software or anything of that sort.<br/><br/>As far as bad points go, I'd have to say the screen is not as bright and colorful/pretty as I might wish for. It looks OK -- it is functional -- but viewing angle is a bit critical and I get the overall impression of looking at sharp images but through a thin fog. I assume this type screen has some advantage in reduced power consumption, or maybe it is just much less expensive to produce? Also the case is flat or matte white; I guess I'd prefer glossy blue or black myself, because I sometimes have greasy fingers when I'm in the garage checking for Vine freebies with one hand while taking bolts out of my transfer case with the other. I'd call it 4.5 stars, but for $200, and in light of the speed and problem-free operation, I think these minor gripes are acceptable in a practical device.<br/><br/>-------------<br/><br/>Edit, 4 months later:<br/><br/>This little computer is great! I have dozed off a few times and my wife or teenage daughters got hold of it, and they all love it too. Also when we have to go to a doctor appointment with our 2-year-old, this thing is a lifesaver for how it keeps her busy watching cartoons over the hospital wifi. It never fails to come on quick, and the battery life is still super. The way the touchpad works is just blows any previous laptop touchpad I've used out of the water. I've always felt they were such a poor substitute for a mouse, but this one leaves very little to be desired.<br/><br/>-------------<br/><br/>2 or 3 months more yet, and we still love this thing! One single time I think our 2.5 year old daughter pushed too many buttons at once and the screen froze up. It would not respond to any buttons, would not turn off, even the clock was stopped on a certain minute. But we just let the battery run down, recharged it in the morning, and everything was fine again! I see now the price for these has dropped to an amazingly low $155. I suppose eventually this will be discontinued to be replaced with an updated model that odds are will not work as good... I am sorely tempted to buy another one for my family while the getting is good, though we don't particularly need it.
Real easy to use. Completely versatile.<br/>One difference between this and the expensive laptops -- it is about 1/3 to 1/4 the price of other equally capable laptops.<br/>I also have a Acer desktop; both are solid.
Got this before Black Friday sales and received it today.  I had an Acer PC in the past and it was good so I thought to give it a try since its discounted.  I am used to windows office system in the past, this Chromebook is very similar in terms of the applications.  It is easy to figure out what is what and how to set it up.  The speed on internet is fast as well and everything is loaded in the cloud so it does not store in the hardware and slow down the computer -- at least not yet.  The Chromebook will also save a lot of my money because I finally no longer need to spend money to purchase windows office and the other applications like powerpoints, word, excel.  Everything is aviliable in the Chrome and I can covert it to be office compatible.  My kids also told me that in their school they use Chromebook?  Which was a surprise to me, I thought it would be Windows or Mac.  I guess its because the Chrome app are free and this save school a lot of money as well.  So I guess Chrome would be a trend as well.<br/><br/>This PC is very light because every parts are like plastic, I don't know how its going to be like on a drop test so need to be extra careful.  The only thing so far I do not like is it does not have the page down and page up key which I am so used to on the IBM PC .  For a PC, this is great!
Yes it met and exceded my expectations!  My brother who is like a computer dr (had been in meetings w Bill Gates!) Said to go with that for my new computer-- better than a windows OS! And I believe it is!
I absolutely love this little laptop. I keep seeing reviews that say how they love the Chromebook but say, "It's not for everyone." I don't understand that, is it good and a nice computer or is it a bad computer? I for one say that this laptop is great, unless you need to run something like Autocad or Solidworks then this laptop should do everything you need. I was only really focused on two things when I was looking for a new computer: good battery life as this was the main reason I was getting a new laptop, and the ability to run flash based website like Webassign.net. These two things were all I was really focused on, yet I find that I got much more than that. I was very surprised as to how nice this keyboard feels while typing, I originally planned to only type for long periods on my mechanical keyboard back home but I find typing on this laptop is not near as bad as my last laptop and is more than comfortable enough to type long papers on. The only thing this laptop can't do is run third party programs, and run java browser plug-ins. Other than those two things this laptop does everything I could need it to do.<br/><br/>Oh and one last bit, I tend to get more than 10 hours on each battery charge, well over the advertised 8.5
awesome... Laptop booted under 5 seconds and with no problems. It's lightning fast, and has great speakers and a great battery. This laptop is the best one iv'e owned! It's well worth the price!
Use this as the family computer with 3 kids.  Has already taken a lot of abuse, and has held up really well, it's speed has been just find loading webpages and playing YouTube videos.
The Acer Chromebook 11 is remarkable for the price- actually it is remarkable period!. I am not a computer professional. As I understand it the Acer Chromebook 11 is a bare bones type of computer- really for use with the internet. On looking over some of the other reviews, there are many things that a chrome book could do but given that I mostly use computers to go on the internet, this laptop is perfect for my needs. First of all, it is incredibly light. As light as my iPad. Therefore, it is great to travel with. It is small enough to pack away in a carryon. It runs on google software so you could play music, watch movies and get email without any difficulty. It takes photos, allows you to read books, and there is even a word processor. Battery life is excellent- longer than expected. My only complaint is that the keyboard does not light up making it difficult to work in low light. But what do you expect for $200. Actually, I wish I knew about this chrome book earlier. I would have insisted my daughter get one after her macbook crashed just before exams. It is less than the price of fixing her laptop.  I highly recommend this laptop.
I got this as an inexpensive introduction to the chromebook capabilities. It was perfect for this and for people with modest speed, video quality and screen size expectations.
fantastic for the price. I dont like bringing my expensive laptops with me on the road. this is perfect. does whatever I need to do and I dont have to worry about damaging it
If you want a fast performing device that can do all the basic tasks that you expect out of a modern day laptop at a very affordable price, get this Chromebook immediately; best bang for the buck. I can't believe how quickly the price went up on Amazon, thankfully I got mine at $120. My only gripe is how quickly it can run out of memory and refreshes the tabs in a programmed succession, but that's only because I have like a dozen extensions running and 8-10 tabs open at any given time, the average user probably utilizes much less. Thankfully the situation has been much improved after I enabled "Swap" to get extra virtual ram through the use of my SSD. Besides, the same thing would happen in a comparable 4Gb model but less noticeable, it's just the way the OS is setup. The 100Gb Google Drive offer is also a bonus and practically costs the same as the computer itself. Also you can run Linux on it if you want but I didn't even consider it because I'm enjoying ChromeOS so much, it's only going to get better and better over time. I'd be a little concerned if I was Microsoft because Google has something going here.
I was supposed to get my chromebook anywhere between the 17th and 22nd of July. It is the 15th and I got it today. Fully charged. I haven't tested it out too much because I have only been on it for about 15 minutes but so far I am loving it! I was skeptical about buying a refurbished computer for a cheap price, but it was so worth it. I am in love with this chromebook. The boot up was really fast and the set up portion of it was a breeze. I must say that this is one of my best investments. My advice to anyone looking to purchase a computer would be to get a chromebook. They sell at great low prices and they boot up very quickly. We all think that we need a fancy high priced laptop for school or work but really we don't. We mainly use the computers for the internet and that's what chromebooks were made for, so that you can skip the long boot up of a regular laptop or desktop. I am very impressed. I decided to write this review because I am a person who takes reviews seriously when I am looking to buy something online. So for anyone who may be skeptical about this product, I assure you it will be money well spent.
Going to keep this brief.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Lightweight.<br/>Touchpad and keyboard very good for the price.<br/>Perfect size for people with smaller hands.<br/>Fits in backpack with ease, even in a sleeve.<br/>No slow Windows boot time.<br/>No vents, this is passively cooled.<br/>Wide array of ports.<br/><br/>Cons: I went into this purchase expecting ChromeOS to use a little less RAM than it does.  If you're visiting sites in individual tabs with a large amount of media you'll find yourself quickly running out of RAM.  I don't necessarily fault ChromeOS for this, I knew that 2 GB was still going to be on the low end.  If you're wanting to run Crouton as I do, fork out a little more and get a model with 4 GBs of RAM.<br/><br/>Don't regret this purchase one bit, I have no desire to use my Windows PC anymore, and not just because MS owes me a free key for one of their updates corrupting the MBR on one of my SSDs.  As someone who has always loved Google products and services (I've only bought Nexus phones), I welcome ChromeOS into my home after toying with the idea of getting one for so long.
Everything about this is wonderful. My only complaint is the screen, it doesn't have the vibrant brightness and contrast I've become used to from ipads and tablets.
This is the perfect computer for a student. very light, very good battery life, very easy to use.  Actually got me to switch my email account from Hotmail to Gmail.
Bought this for my daughter, along with the iPearl hard shell case, and she absolutely loves the thing. Does everything she needs and give good bang for the buck.
I've been looking at getting a Chromebook for about a year or so.  It succeeds in replacing my Windows PC as my primary computer for so many reasons:<br/><br/>1.  Extremely fast boot up from complete shutdown (about 7-8 seconds)<br/>2.  No OS update hassles (or mandatory restarts due to updates)<br/>3.  Great battery life (average 8-9 hours).<br/>4.  Good performance (Performs as well as my Windows computer for web browsing).<br/>5.  Aesthetically pleasing.<br/>6.  Great at HD video with a crisp anti-glare screen.<br/><br/>The thing that surprised me the most though,  was the fact that I was able to do about 90% of the things that I do on my Windows PC (including using Microsoft software programs online).<br/>The biggest thing that I do on my PC that I couldn't do on my Chromebook,  is burn or play cd's or dvd's.  I did also have a slight issue with the system freezing up briefly on occasion (one time was during a very low battery).<br/>The built in microphone also works much better than the one on my Windows PC.  Well done Acer!
Received this product today and when it was powered up, it said the operating system was damaged or missing. Talk about disappointment!
I used to pooh-pooh Chrome OS, but this turned out to be one of the best computer investments I've ever made, and much cheaper than the old, agonizingly slow Windows netbook it replaced.  I just want a cheap laptop to take traveling, that allows me to go online, check email, and remote into the office.  The latter doesn't come out of the box, but the $10 Chrome RDP app took care of that.  And it's gloriously fast!  It starts up and shuts down almost instantly, and Chrome itself runs faster than the Windows version (though the Mac version is also pretty fast).  I also like the fact that the OS is locked down for greater security.  True, you can unlock the OS and turn it into a Linuxbook, but I haven't felt any compelling need to do that: this is not my development box!  Plus, it's so convenient to use that I keep it right by my bed (which is where I'm typing this).
This was exactly what I needed for my children to use for homeschool.  My children are aged 6, 5, and 4 and with no prior computer experience are now easily using the Internet to access online learning programs.  These programs run smoothly and quickly on this chrome book while on my own very pricey laptop can be slow and glichy.  The keys are perfect for my children as they are not overly sensitive and have a real keyboard feel. The size is perfect, allowing for nice quality graphics, but is not cumbersome or too heavy for the children to have on their lap during use. The chrome book also suprised me in the it doesn't feel cheap, it actually feels substantial despite its very light weight. I am so happy with this that I am buying another one for my mother so she can also have an easy to use machine to access the Internet without a hassel.
Fast shipping. Does exactly what I need it to without a crap ton of unnecessary garbage. I'm officially a chromebook convert.
What a great little unit.  I honestly did not know what to expect, as I had never even used a Chromebook before.  I wanted to try it, so I thought I would go for economy.  I don't know what else a person would want.  It is a compact size, very light, boots in 5 seconds.  Honestly, it really boots in 5 seconds.  So far, it does everything I want it to do.  The speakers are great, and the screen is nice and bright.  I was reading using kindle in the cloud and it was perfect.  I know they make these bigger with bigger processors, etc.  But, I don't know what you would need it for.  I was a little apprehensive and kind of in the bigger is better mindset, but so far this thing is great.  Very inexpensive.  If you can live with Google Drive for apps, and you are primarily on the internet, this is a good unit to consider.
absolutely, hands down one of the best PC / Laptop purchases I've ever made.<br/><br/>The proprietary jack for the power supply is a downer.  I would have preferred a USB cord.  Also, the display could be a little sharper and more vibrant, but<br/><br/>It's super light<br/>Charges wicked fast (around 30 minutes for a full charge if you don't use while charging)<br/>Battery lasts fo eva! (~8 hours)<br/>Speakers are AWESOME.  I'm currently living in an RV with my wife while I develop homestead and micro-retreat center in Central New York and we often watch Netflix at night together.  The sound coming from such tiny speakers is surprisingly big, deep and rich.  Perfect for streaming media.<br/>It's fast (boots in seconds)<br/>NO VIRUSES OR MALWARE - since it's running on Chrome OS, I don't have to worry about getting infected.<br/><br/>Definitely buy again.
Love my chromebook!  I definitely recommend reading a bit about the differences between a standard laptop and a chromebook before purchasing if you aren't already aware of them.  It is different!  But I don't mind having to save everything to the cloud and having essentially an "online only" computer.  If you aren't the type of person who stores a lot of photos, music, etc on your hard drive, then this should work for you.  It's fast and so light!  My boyfriend and I actually fight over who gets to keep the chromebook and who has to use his macbook pro (especially for vacations), that's how much we both like the chromebook!  Also, just for the record, I have very minimal computer/technology skills and have had absolutely no problems at all setting this up and using it for the past few months.
Wonderful product, beautiful. The edge looks a little wide which makes it less modern. But for the price, it is a good buy
I was surprised how much I love this.  First Chromebook.  I am using this instead of my Samsung Tablet which is taking longer and longer to charge, and battery lasting short and shorter time.  Also, I am happy to have the keyboard back, and this device really does run 12 hours, plus charges up in a zip.  It's even lighter than my 10" tablet.  Just remember this is Not a touchpad, but the speed on this more than makes up for it.  Everything about it is blink-of-an-eye fast, never have to "wait" for anything to load.  It's also cool looking.  I'm not sure if cool is still a word.  Highly recommend this, if you understand what a chromebook is and want lightweight, fast, basic email and web surfing uses and listening to music or watch movies.  The visual is better than I expected as well.
If you're looking for a simple, lightweight laptop with long battery life, you've come to the right place. While admittedly you cannot do much offline, this Chromebook is a beast when it comes to keeping you connected with a suite of social and productivity apps like Facebook and Google Docs.  The 16GB internal memory seems a bit light at first glance, but you can add more memory with SD cards for movies, music, pictures and more.<br/><br/>Without Windows weighing it down, the Chromebook is extremely fast in doing everyday tasks. The white is pretty sleek, although it can get dirty on occasion that a simple cleaning will easily take care of.<br/><br/>Overall, being a huge Google user in the first place, I find the Chromebook to be an outstanding value and highly recommend it.
I purchased 2 of these Acer Chromebook, one for my little sister and one for my nephew. I absolutely love them! I opened it to make sure they work properly before I gift them to the kids on Christmas and have issues. They are light weight and compact, it could literally fit in my handbag. The kids will love it, I'm more excited to give it to them than anything. I was lucky and got them while they were still on sale for $179, I see now they are $199 so I'm happy I purchased when I did. I would definitely recommend this chromebook to others. Thanks to Prime shipping I got it in 2 days which really added to the experience!
I remember a few years back all the talk about these “Chromebooks” and eventually got around to playing with one (don’t remember brand) and was around $400 plus if I recall correctly; was not that thrilled when for a few hundred, if that, more I could get a laptop with better specs and so on. But now, different story. For $200 they literally doubled the specs and doubled down on the price and the outcome is a great product. Its no powerhouse, its not made for Photoshop, but when you sit down and think about what most people generally do with there PCs, this does most of it at a fraction of the price. Highly recommended.
So I ordered my Chromebook after NOT being able to purchase from local Walmart. I ordered on Thursday relieved on Saturday and started using on Monday! IT's just like using my phone, but a lot faster and bigger! LOL  I love the fact I can download apps (looks like only from Google tho). It charged fast, I currently have 78% charge left as we speak. Working with my WiFi it moves pretty fast though websites. I'm learning how to work it efficiently since controls and tabs are not like your normal laptop. Day one of usage and Im happy! Now to find a protector for it, this white will be dirty fast!
I own two Apples and three Window machines, but now this is the only machine I ever use.
Imlove this machine,i cant live without it. Great value, hot looks, the ultimate bargin.
It's an amazing little laptop for the price and chrome OS isn't as bad as I first thought the first time I read about it. My only complain is that the first laptop I got had a couple of dead pixels. Amazon being the awesome store that it is sent me a replacement which I'm using right now but again I found one dead pixel. Other than that the build quality is better than expected, keyboard is comfortable, screen is nice enough and laptop feels sturdy enough to throw in my bag without worrying much and for $200 I think it's an excellent device to carry around instead of a $1300 laptop.
Bought this for a vacation next year so I could stay in touch via email with my sister and friend (I don't have an iPhone and don't wish to buy one).  I have a computer at home that isn't portable, so I wanted something tiny and lightweight I could travel with.  Didn't need bells or whistles, nor did I need Windows.  This does the trick.  Not really as sharp a picture as my home computer, but then it's a very small screen compared to my other one.  It's fast and everything works on it that I need.  Cute as a button and will be very easy to transport.
I own three  of these computers ( and one of last years C720).  They work extremely well.  It seems to be just a quick, if not faster than my Macbook on the web.  The case feels a little flimsy but my 10 year old son has used/abused last years model C720 for over a year and it has not suffered any damage.  I also use them for my construction business in the field and have not had any issues.  This is an amazing deal.  I just ordered another one and had an issue with the charger.  Amazon delivered a replacement the same day that I called about it.
Any apprehension I had regarding a "cheesy" Chromebook is totally out the window.  I'm blown away by the performance, quality, and experience using this Acer.  I have 15+ years in the enterprise IT business with Windows and UNIX.  I was expecting a half baked desktop experience with this and I have to say it was as good as a Windows desktop, if not better considering the bang for the buck.<br/><br/>It requires a few extra free things you want to install from the Chrome store, but other than that, its a turn it on and go experience.
I'm not going to lie, I mostly got this computer because I think its cute. I know, horrible. I only needed a computer for an online class that I'm taking, to brose the internet and occasionally watch Netflix. So I didn't need to worry too much about all the features. This computer is perfect for what I need it for and I haven't had any troubles with it. It is very light weight and there are no delays. The only bad thing would be the built in camera, its ok, probably would take a better picture is good lighting but not in dim lighting. But I didn't buy a camera I bought a computer so overall this is a great product.
'Tis a lovely little thing.  For the price, less than $140 it's a winner.  Only issues are 1.  Sometimes I've had keyboard lag.  Maybe email programs as haven't found it on g'docs. 2.  There are times when I really strain to read small type fonts. I knew that might be the case going in.  But it's light, battery life is great for me.  It's very usable.  Sits on my lap and typing is fine in the "recliner".  Love the speed it "lights up with".  Good no antivirus and all that b.s.  Even Hillary Clinton could figure this one out.
Very fast and easy. Screen looks great, and sound volume is good. I researched a lot of chromebooks, and different processors, etc... at the end of the day a $400 chromebook is really not much faster then a $200 one. If you think a  hundred extra bucks will get you a huge jump in speed you are wrong, you probably will barely notice it at best. Only difference I could see between this and a $400 one is screen size, and maybe a quicker buffer time on 1080p video. This one does 99% of what the more expensive ones do just as good as them, and is still faster then most windows computers.
Booting up takes less than 8 seconds, non-reflective screen aids visibility, battery lasts all day, no cooling fan, hardly gets warm, excellent keyboard, solid construction, and the processor is more than adequate for handling several tabs and playing videos. The only downside I can think of is the screen has a lower pixel density than I'm used to, but if you're not coming from a high-end smartphone or tablet I doubt you'll notice. If you're debating spending a little extra on the C720, it really isn't necessary. The C670 does the job just fine and has a much longer lasting battery.
I love this machine.  My last computer was an expensive Dell XPS with a lot of high quality components.  The thing is... I never actually did anything with it.  I never played a lot of games.  I just did papers for school and browsed the internet (when I should have been working on the former...)  Now I just manned up and admitted that I don't need a $1300 facebook machine.  This chromebook is perfect. The only problem with it, is that it switches between people so easily that my girlfriend uses it all the time.
it boots up almost immediately. If you spend 99% of your time on a laptop wasting time on the interwebs, this is the thing for you. However, if you need more computer functions such as storing data, photos, etc. I would recommend going with a real laptop. Although the chromebook does all those things, it can't connect to every device you want to transfer data from. For example, my cell phone wouldn't connect so I had to find another way to transfer photos onto my removable hard drive. Hope this review helps!
Great price for a basic computer that can do all the basic things that so many people need. Really great for non-techies. All the apps are there, the operating system automatically updates/upgrades, and the system is extremely secure with dual authentication. What I find most attractive is the reduced burden of concern for equipment costs and continually upgrading hardware. With the Chrome system, it is likely to be a long time before you have to buy something new; but even when you do, it won't be much.
It was a gift for dad. It worked as far as google, YouTube, and Facebook.  Only caveat is the lower left of the mouse pad was cosmetically damaged and when I connect to Bluetooth on my bose soundlink mini, the picture and sound are out of sync if you pause and go to another program sa you wanted to google something while you're watching. Other than that no complaints so far. Its been almost a month of use. As I said it's a gift and I don't expect my dad to use it other than those programs I mentioned.
It is very light and compact.  I love this laptop and would purchase it again in a second.  I use this primarily for streaming and surfing the web.  For the price, this Chromebook does exactly what it needs to do.  The battery life is still fantastic after daily use since the time I purchased it.  This is not for the individual who needs to run multiple applications while streaming lectures/videos.  This is for the guy/girl who needs to surf the web, shop online, or watch some movies/youtube videos.
I bought this for my 12 year old grand-daughter. I didn't really know enough about the Chromebook as opposed to the common laptop sold everywhere as I should. It wouldn't carry the programs that my grand-daughter needed for school, (Word, Excel etc) but I had a friend make some minor adjustments and now this little jewel does everything she wants and needs. It even looks beautiful and is perfect for her. It weighs half as much as my laptop and has enough speed and memory to last her a while.
I ordered this because my XP lost its sound (bad guy software, no doubt), was out of date and finally I couldn't get on the Internet at all (Microsoft no doubt).<br/>This unit is incredible and for the price, cannot be beaten.  I was worried that I might get a refurb but it was brand new and worked easily right out of the box.  I'm still amazed at the value provided and the ease of both setup and use.  If you need or want an easy-to-use, Internet only, light weight, cheap thing, this is it!
This is my second Chromebook. I had my first for several years before it met it's untimely death (someone who will remain nameless to protect the guilty spilled a large coffee saturating the keyboard). In the entire life of my Chromebook, it never had a virus or malware issue and there was never a need for expensive virus protection because Google provides that for free. My wife recently bought a Windows laptop and as already spent a fortune cleaning up virus and malware issues.
great to surf the net without going to my office to use my main lap-top
Works fine for most of my needs, like email, general web activity, and Netflix, but I can't use a lot of programs (applications?) I'd like to, like iTunes and the Citrix server. My fault for not knowing that those things wouldn't work universally, but leaving this in the review in case other people are considering the same purchase (and are failing to consider the same things).  It's very lightweight and has decent battery life.  I think this would be a great second/travel computer for someone who doesn't need it to do everything.
Best little machine!! I travel a lot and cover media events and typically use my tablet with an extrenal keyboard for taking notes and writing. My Logitech keyboard broke and I needed a quick replacement. Considered getting another keyboard than saw this machine and the minimal price tag and decided to get it instead. Wow....to say I love it is an understatement! So functional, lightweight and small that i take it eveeywhere and hardly use my tablet any longer.
This is great for the price.  I have been recommending this to a lot of people.  It is quick, light, and kinda cute in white.  Most people I know buy laptops, but they really only need a chromebook.  All they do is facebook, edit their photos, shop online, write a few documents, and check their emails.  This is great for that.  It's super fast and you can't get viruses.  Plus, if you break it (which happens to some of my friends a lot) it isn't very expensive.
This is my second Chromebook. The first was a 1st generation Samsung, and I think I got spoiled. It only "died" because it got dropped dozens of times and eventually the screen went bad.<br/><br/>I've only had this one for a week or so, and my V key is already super-sticky (and I haven't spilled anything on the keyboard.) It freezes up twice a day and has to be restarted.<br/><br/>I don't hate this thing, but it's not like the Samsung one was.
This is my second Chromebook after 2 1/2 years of really hard use the last one died.  I knew I needed another one so I ordered this one.  As usual Amazon got it too me in 2 days.  I was up and running in 10 min.  Love these machines!  Started with computers years ago with a giant Gateway.  These are the best yet.  I can watch videos, search the web, play some games and just about anything else I would like to do including shopping on Amazon..
It is a very nice Chromebook. I do a lot of travelling and bought this Acer as a backup to my Samsung Chromebook. For the much cheaper price I would rate the Acer as equal to the Samsung. The Acer trackpad is more sensetive than the trackpad of the Samsung which offers a much smoother operating experience. An additional advantage is that it can also be opened flat for taking photos, something the Samsung cannot do due to the fixed hinge.
Not much different than my Acer C720 Chromebook. This one is white which I personally love, and the charging port and HDMI are now in the back of the unit, which is also great. Performance wise, I don't really see a difference. Same goes for graphics and sound. I like the two tiny LED's and the black keys paired with the white base gives it a nice look. The touch pad is now bigger and better than ever. I have no problems with it at all.<br/><br/>Also don't forget to visit the CHROME STORE!!! Please do yourself a get an adblocking extension such as uBlock Origin (light on CPU), or the more popular AdBlock Plus and Adblocker. DO IT! It will block all ads on any webpages, including YouTube!
Awesome. Great for a student. I'm in college and if it works for someone who's as busy as I am, it will work for anybody, I can assure you. Battery life is incredible, it's lightweight, silent, startup is instant, et cetera. Of course, there is limited use when not connected to the Internet, but I'm sure you can download an app from the Google AppStore to mitigate that issue. The price is excellent for such a great piece of machinery.
Purchased this to replace by heavy 15.6" laptop. It died while writing an assignment for school and to my surprise I was able to get the delivered same day!  Wow impressive. I am able to do everything I need with this device and the best part is that it's light as a feather and fits perfectly in most of my purses. Its a really great option for those who travel a bit that don't need all the big programs, kids, or college students.
it's ok- it's not as good as linux but at least its not windows!
I bought this especially for college. After reading the reviews (72% Good) I was skeptical about the fact that the Chromebook has no Windows Office. However, I read there was Google Docs and took a chance and I've got to say I'm in no way disappointed. The appearance is pleasing, it's fast, it's light. Google has definitely stepped up there game as well as Acer. I know for a fact this will not be my only or last Chromebook.
This is the most intuitive computer I've ever used. There's no manual, but I don't miss it at all.  The keyboard fits my hands and responds great.  It's different in some ways, but a little experience with Android helps.  Of course, I'm comparing it with Windows 8, so it's not hard to find something better.  I can't believe I can get a computer like this for such a low price.  As always, the Amazon delivery was super quick.
I bought this chromebook before it became the #1 best seller in laptops. i couldnt have made a better decision! As long as you're not getting this to play large games (it plays some small apps pretty good) or to run large programs, then this laptop should work out just fine! i basically only use it to search the web, type documents for school (use google drive a lot), and youtube (runs youtube VERY well). Great laptop!
When I returned to college my partner bought me a Chromebook. I am impressed. The platform took some adjustment because I work with Apple products & Microsoft products but I understood this in a just a few days. Everything I create is backed up when I connect to wifi. Sometimes I need Ethernet but it's not really an inconvenience for me. If the headline doesn't recommend it enough I don't know what else to say.
For the price point, this Chromebook is outstanding. Although it's only packing a Celeron, it manages to run extremely smooth. Not to mention it has a sleek, lightweight design. However, as the construction is plastic, it can feel a little cheap in the hand, but that shouldn't deter you from purchasing this sleek device, as the low price, fantastic screen, and respectable battery life more than make up for it.
I bought this computer because I needed something to help me get through the school year that wasn't going to break the bank. I picked it after seeing someone else using one during a seminar. I've had it for almost a week and I am VERY satisfied with how it works. If you are mostly interested in typing up documents and using the internet for watching videos or using social media then this bad boy is for you.
Far superior to windows and so much cheaper for run of the mill functions. Don't know about games, graphics, etc. Only weakness is Skype<br/>video calling does not work without special work around. Hangouts (google video chat) is free to use. Faster boots,longer battery life, works with printers, and very simple start up. Move your bookmarks to Chrome browser and they are there when you start Chromebook.
One of the two new chrome books arrived with no operating system. Called chrome spent three hours making a reboot operating system, then they advised if we had any additional errors we needed to exchange the chrome book because it appears there maybe a hardware issue this shouldn't happen out of the box. Was a birthday present so we are trying to see if it keeps working, fingers crossed. The second chrome book appears to be working fine.
For the money it's a great deal and built very well. I use it mainly to read news papers and Google drive, video streaming works pretty well with a solid internet connection. The screen is not the best on the market nor the speakers, the keyboard is tight and track pad works just fine as well. If you do want a Chromebook and it's your first, pick this one up and give it a shot!
I bought this Chromebook for my daughter to replace a Samsung Chromebook of which the screen was becoming faulty.<br/>The Acer has a much more solid build and the performance is excellent not to mention it is very attractive. My daughter is very happy with it and agrees that it is a much better Chromebook. I was able to get this device for $187, I can't recommend it too much.
This works well for a school computer and was a great price, I wish I would have gotten a regular ACER vs the Chromebook. I have a dell inspiron to use for printing, music, downloading files, ect, but the chrome book really doesn't let you do everything you need, this is more of a supplemental PC so I don't have to drag my dell to school. Great, but you get what you pay for...
This is a great solution for a great price. Quick start up, good battery life, good speed.  I was looking for something to use at home, mainly checking personal email, logging into work web access email, online shopping and social media sites.  I love having a keyboard.  It's so light weight that it's easy to take along.  As long as you have Wifi access this is a great option.
It's a Chromebook which is simplicity itself.  Price is nice and quality it excellent.  This is a replacement for an older model (different make).  I don't expect these things to last more than a couple of years and they are so cheap who really cares.  It would be nice if the SD cards on these devices fit flush with the case so they could be left in, less chance of losing it.
I bought this laptop for my son and he loves it! It works perfectly and I even use it sometimes too. I think if you are looking for a laptop, this would be the laptop you would want. It comes with a charger, instruction book, and a 1 year warranty. The charger is white as well as the laptop. It has a really easy set up too. My son set it up in about 1 minute. Yeah, that fast.
Love it.  Perfect for everything I do.  This is my second one.  I bought this one for my son.  He is even impressed.  He installed Fallout on it and was surprised it ran so well.  This is from a guy who built his own gaming computer with top of the line graphics card.  I only use mine for basic things like surfing the net and basic word/excel things.  I highly recommend it.
The finish and fit are great. The trackpad is awesome. I can do 90% of what I do on a computer on this little Chromebook--for the remainder I have to go to my "real" computer in my home office. It's light, portable, reliable (and if I really learn the ins and outs of the Chrome OS, maybe it's versatile as well). I just love it and can't believe it only cost $150.
I initially bought this for my fifth grade sister to do her homework on, but I've been finding myself going to this trusty laptop whenever I need to work on a quick assignment too. It boots up fast and has no clutter, allowing you to do what you need. The cover gets dirty a little quickly though (esp in the hands of an elementary schooler) but it should clean off easily.
I love this little laptop. I love that it's nice and light. Quick boot-up and picks up where you left off when you power it back on. It's perfect enough to take around with me to campus and does everything that I need it to. Would definitely recommend this product to any student who needs a simple little laptop in order to get their work done. Great shipping with Prime!
Excellent deal!  We recently purchased this chromebook for my 10yr old as a birthday present.  He wanted an actual laptop but I couldn't justify the  $$ so he could learn how to type and maneuver his way.<br/>This chromebook works great.  He's able to go online and practice typing through various typing apps and sites.  There are also a good selection of games for him.
This Chromebook is exactly what we were looking for. It was under $150 and a quick delivery. It is light and fast processing. This Chromebook has little to no space but it offers great apps with google and box storage... which although that is a change, it works and we needed to make that change anyways. It would be great for an adult, student, child... easy to use!
I suppose everything happens for a reason. I received this Chromebook in NON working condition.  The only thing I can say about this is that it was a nice looking laptop and it was lite. So you know I called ACER technical support and they told me to return the product or ship it to them to fix it. If Amazon would have swapped this out for me, I would have kept it.
Exactly what I needed. Pretty much a glorified tablet at half the price. It's fast and is perfect for surfing the web and doing homework. Internet is a must to use it but I'm addicted to its portability based on weight and battery power. The matte screen is an added bonus, because it allows me to do work and surf the Internet outside without an awful glare.
I love this little computer!  Even on our very rural farm with marginal internet access, this computer is quick and fun. I learned to use it efficiently in a very short time and find I can do all the things I hoped I could do on a convenient home computer.  It is lightweight, small enough to carry easily and yet powerful enough to do about anything I need.
I got this on Groupon for 120, was looking for something simple that I could just get online and work my business and it is was more than I could ask for. I expected something that was a little outdated and old school but it looks so modern, lightweight and has all the features you need in a basic computer. Such a steal and would HIGHLY recommend!!!!
Perfect size, very convenient to take with me from room to room or to go. The battery life is very long, and it starts up at once with no waiting. I'm very happy with the product. I own a desktop and a smart phone, and this is great for emails, etc. Saves my data time with my cellular service, and allows me mobility. I loved the low price as well!
I purchased this as a backup computer for travels/when on the go and it's been fantastic! The only downside is there's not much hard drive storage so everything is hosted via apps/sites which require wifi. I love the bonus that comes with the purchase as well for go go inflight wifi. The value of that is even more than the cost of the comp!
Not a bad computer to use for school purposes. The best thing about this laptop is, it doesn't need security bc its iOS so browse the s*** outta stuff X). Its pretty basic, no microsoft word or nothing but mostly everything in the computer is mostly tied with google. I recommend getting this laptop for beginners especially if you broke X)
Surprisingly good! Fast, great keyboard, great screen, and light. I also have a Macbook Air (mid 2011) and have to say the Acer is way faster. Mac gets bogged down with more than 10 browsing tabs open. I've had more system crashes on OS X than I care for. When you also compare by price, Acer is a vastly better deal for everyday surfing.
I just love my new chromebook. I've been a long time Macbook user but with my previous Mac dying, I just didn't feel like paying<br/>so much when this chromebook is good enough for most of my needs.<br/>The battery life is great, keyboard feels nice, and it boots up really quickly which is a big plus. Mostly, I love the price.
Super Quick Shipping, Love That Amazon Texts You So You Know When It Arrives, That Makes It Safe. Great Price For A Really Good Laptop. It's Definitely Worth The Money! It's Bigger Than I Thought It'd Be. Very Lightweight. Overall I'm Very Happy With My Purchase No Complaints. I Would Definitely Recommend This Laptop To Anyone.
Wow Acer + Chrome OS is a match made in heaven. Fast and portable. It's just the right size, I had an acer netbook and it sucked. It was too slow because it was full of windows bloat ware, and it was just too small. This is a good compromise with a great user interface. Plus all the trial google apps are actually pretty good.
It's really compact and does the job for basic internet users. I only use it for browsing the internet and watching videos. I do find that occasionally the sound goes out for no apparent reason in the middle of watching something. I usually just close it for a few minutes and open it back up and it typically comes back on.
Phenomenal product! I can do anything with this Chromebook that can be done with a laptop. Boot and shutdown time is 4-5 seconds. Battery life is between 10-12 hours depending on settings. Have been involved with technology since the 80s and this is one of the most simple yet elegantly designed products I've encountered!
Absolutely love this laptop. I bought it for my daughters to use for their online schoolwork. Great for that purpose. I love that it is bare bones as far as preloaded programs/software. Boots up quickly, runs fast, lightweight and great charge time! Definitely a chromebook fan now! Will be buying a second one soon!
Took 2 tries but I love the product .<br/>Suggest one buys it new. I did not the first go around, but true to form Amazon came through and arranged for the return and refund .<br/>If you are looking for portability, writing documents and Internet this is for you .<br/>There is also I find a long battery life.
i love my new chromebook! its great for browsing the web facebook, doing surveys. nice light weight and compact laptop. it does not get hot when on for a long time. And the battery lasts a long time. i would definately recommend this to any one who needs a cheap well working laptop. you wont be disappointed.
Small and light. It's portable and very easy to use- prefect for a student or someone on the go who is ok with just watching Netflix and writing papers- very simple tasks. It does not have a place to put in a DVDs, etc. great product for the price if you are looking for something simple to get the job done.
It's only $150, so there isn't much to complain about. The one thing I find very annoying is the little mouse pad (not sure what to call it). It's very loud and requires you to press it much harder than my Macbook. I think this is a perfect computer for a teenager that needs one for school or something.
Considered a tablet versus a chromebook.. I decided on the Acer chromebook and could not be happier.. Having a keyboard makes a huge difference... I have already installed multiple apps from the store with no issues.. The battery life is great.. 6 hours minimum.. I mostly use it for e-mail and netflix..
I was looking for a small laptop to use between my classroom and home.  This is it!  Very light and portable. I love that it doesn't have to boot up every time I need to use.  Getting use to using google documents has been a bit of a learning curve but nothing too difficult.  You can't beat the price!
Great computer. Lightweight and pretty simple. I bought this for school and it works great. I download my files as Microsoft word and turn them into my English 101 class just fine. The only thing is you can't right click, so I copy and paste using the ctrl button. Ctrl C and ctrl V for copy and paste
Great chromebook for someone who wants to surf the web, some writing, and other things you need to do online. I recommend youtubing some videos to learn about it first, if you don't know anything about them, like I didn't. Gives you explanations on usage and little hints. The price is great for this!
This is my backup laptop. I have 2 hp laptops that are constantly getting viruses and other problems, so when they are in the shop I can always rely on my chrome. It is super fast, light weight and always dependable. Best investment for a laptop I ever made. Inexpensive but always dependable. Love it
Bought this for my 7 year old son. He can manuever it well for his homework and games. We are very happy with it. Arrived fast. It was smaller than I expected, maybe the measurements in my head were off. It would be better if it wasnt white. But this had the best reviews and amazing for the price.
I could not be happier with this Chromebook.  My $800 Lenovo died.  Only 1.5 years old.  I vowed not to spend big bucks on a laptop again.  I really only wanted a laptop to surf the internet on.  This little Chromebook is great.  What a bargain.  Starts fast.  Sturdy case.  Perfect!!!!  I love it.
Superb & cannot believe its so cheap!  This is not my main computer, but I use this when working in the living room or to check something.  I absolutely love it.  I am totally impressed with it, the look, the use of it, speed, everything.  Absolutely worth buying this, I am now a fan of Chrome OS.<br/><br/>Battery life is excellent, I had no problems typing, plus it loads in seconds.  I absolutely love this little thing!  I'm pretty surprised myself that I am writing such a glowing review :)
I have several computers but this has become my go to computer. It is fast, reliable and easy to use. I love using the cloud and being able to print anywhere with access. The only weakness is perhaps gaming but for any serious computing I use Chromebook. I find it difficult to go back to Windows.
Good quality for the money. I'm a big fan of Chromebooks and have found the HP that I bought for my daughter to be the best overall package with the 13" screen and Haswell processor. Nevertheless, I have been able to moderate my usage enough to make this machine meet most of my needs.
Excellent Chromebook..<br/><br/>I own an iMac that has both Windows and Mac as my main PC and for video streaming and other media I normally use one of my several tablets.. I don't have much use for a laptop except for basic documents and really to sit on my lap and browse the internet while I watch TV..<br/><br/>This is where Chromebooks shine!! This Acer 11.6 is actually my second Chromebook.. I purchased it last night because I dropped my two year old Samsung Chromebook and broke its screen.. This Acer actually feels better built than my old Samsung and it offers a much better track pad! The track pad on my Samsung was the first thing that went bad..<br/><br/>Out of the box, the battery was 90% charged and just like any Chromebook it was ready to go! All it wanted was an internet connection and my google credentials and it was ready to go! The nice thing about Chrome OS is that its ready out of the box!!<br/><br/>Battery life: battery life seems to have improved over earlier versions of Chromebooks as well! My Samsung usually averaged 5 - 6 hours.. This got 7 hours out of its first charge and on its second I am going on 8 hours and it has about 5% left!! Most Chromebooks don't have moving parts like harddrives, fans, etc because everything is in the cloud so it doesn't need them.. This allows for amazing battery life!!<br/><br/>Screen: screen is decent on this Chromebook.. It is very bright and vibrant! It's not the screen of a $600 laptop but I paid $150 for mine at Best Buy, and for a $150 laptop the screen is amazing! It is very close to an HD quality screen!<br/><br/>Sound: sound in this Chromebook is amazing! The speakers are very blah but I normally run a Bluetooth speaker with my Chromebook and this computer delivers Excellent sound using a Bluetooth speaker or headphones!!<br/><br/>Uses: Chromebooks have tons of uses! You can use them for educational purposes, use them in your business, use them for media like Netflix, Hulu, and more.. You can use them for school, word processing (remember they use free google documents), use them for blogging! And even gaming if you play online games.. The uses are endless and honestly they are much easier to use for a lot of these task than a tablet..<br/><br/>Tips:<br/>1.) They come with google documents for free BUT if you use Word, or other MS office products MS has online versions now you can use as part of their cloud!! So yes, you can use MS Office on these<br/><br/>2.) You can print with these.. You can either print with a cloud printer or through chrome installed on another computer.. Google Cloud Print<br/><br/>3.) They DO WORK offline now ☺<br/><br/>4.) You can install Linux on these<br/><br/>Overall this is an excellent value for a basic Chromebook.. It can handle 10 - 15 tabs being opened at once and it has plenty of power.. I highly recommend this Chromebook
I got this laptop to replace a 13 inch macbook that was about 5-8 years old, and I've been pretty happy so far. The web browsing is mostly faster, but I've noticed if I have the music app open (which opens in a browser) that web browsing is significantly slower. The laptop also requires a reboot more often than the macbook did. But the battery life is fantastic compared to any laptop I've used, I regularly get 8-10 hours out of it with light use on dim lighting. I'm normally very picky about keyboards too, and I haven't had any of the issues the other reviews reported. I did notice in the settings that you can change the search button back to caps locks if you'd prefer. One odd thing I did notice is that the trackpad behaves slightly differently than mac, like your fingers need to be further apart when doing a double click on chrome. Took a bit of getting used to, but it wasn't a big deal.<br/><br/>I've been surprised that this is able to handle torrents perfectly with JSTorrent, and the browser extension. With the extension you can just right click on a magnet link and add it to your client, works great with the pirate bay. It can also stream music, movies, tv etc from your media server with Plex. I also have VNC working great, I'm able to SSH to other computers, and even FTP/SCP stuff. The chrome store also highlights a lot of great sites online such as clip champ which allows you to transcode video without downloading or installing anything.<br/><br/>It can't run basically anything you'd need to install though, such as games or even simple ruby apps for managing EC2 nodes. One really annoying flaw too is that you must be signed into google to listen to your music, so if you want to sign into your work email that also uses gmail you basically need to stop listening to music for a bit. I was also a bit surprised when I got an invite to google inbox, only to find out that I can't use it without an upgraded phone. It seems like having a chromebook should also qualify you for being able to use inbox.
This is my first ever Chromebook and I must say I am enjoying using this little laptop immensely. There's much to like about a Chromebook; it runs on Google's operating system, it boots up very, very quickly, and it's small enough and light enough to carry around the house, to work, or even on vacation.<br/><br/>It literally took me less than one minute to have the Chromebook up and running once I took it out of the box. The Chromebook easily found my WiFi connection and, once I signed in with my Google account, everything synced perfectly.<br/><br/>Of course working in the Chromebook environment is very different than working on a typical Windows desktop or laptop computer. While is is certainly possible to work offline, and to use a number of the apps offline, you really need to be connected to the Internet to store documents in the cloud. Google has a number of products that mirror popular Microsoft Office products: Google Docs is Word, Google Sheet is Excel, and Google Slides is PowerPoint. You can open documents in the Office related formats or as a PDF, so opening the documents on other computers are not a problem. Additionally, Google has thousands of apps for games, utilities, office-related products, etc., in the Chrome Web store.<br/><br/>Looking for a "save" button in Google Docs? You won't find one. The computer automatically saves a version of your document in the cloud. The good news is that your documents are always available, and hopefully, secure, in the cloud, from any computer, mobile device, etc. Dragging a copy of a document onto your desktop will not save it to your computer's hard drive. You can download it in various formats, and, although I have not tried it yet, I imagine you can download it to a memory card or stick.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, the Acer Chromebook has a 2.16 GHz Intel Celeron processor, 2 GB RAM, and a 16 GB hard drive. The computer has ports for HDMI, a memory card, and USB 2.0 and 3.0. It measures 11.77 x 7.95 x 0.73 inches and weights on 2.4 pounds. The battery is rated to last 8.5 hours. The best feature of all, for me, is that it boots up in about 10 seconds. Google is also offering 100 GB free cloud storage, but I have not tried to see if I am eligible for that yet.<br/><br/>The screen of the Acer Chromebook measures 11.6 inches. While not the sharpest or most colorful screen, it works fine for basic Internet usage, such as YouTube, or general computer activities. I have no problem working on documents or using the keyboard and built-in mousepad.<br/><br/>This is not a computer for doing heavy video editing or other RAM intensive activities, but for basic access to the web, email, document creation and editing, presentations and spreadsheets, it performs really, really well. And, with thousands of apps to choose from in Chrome Store, there's enough to keep anyone entertained. The processor is quick and once you get use to the Chrome operating system, the computer is easy to use. Given the price (cheaper than many tablets) and features, I would highly recommend this.
This tiny laptop is pleasing in every way.  Light and easy to work with ...........I needed one for my transcriber at church (i am deaffend) and also needed internet access to reference library materials.  Sure saves packing all those books around.
Decent portable Chromebook, but the screen color leans heavily blue and washed out. I wish I could calibrate it but I can't. This item loses two points because the screen causes eye stress to me. Other than that I like the form and function of it.
Excellent computer for those who need just the basics. Word prossessing, spreadsheets, drawing are availabe through Google online. The Acer Chromebook is light and so easy to youe and set up. Just be advised that you MUST have a wireless printer.
I'm happy with it. I wasn't expecting a supercomputer at this price, and I didn't get one. For $160 though, I love the look, feel, and experience in general when using this little chromebook. Did I mention the keyboard feels excellent to type on?
This is an amazing product.  This is my second chromebook and an all around beast.  I am going to break down this review first for people that have already used chromebooks in the past, and what makes this model special, and then break down why chrome is so awesome to begin with.<br/><br/>This is the ideal model for me.  It is by far the cheapest that is out out there, and also the best for what I am looking for.  I started using Acer web books with the Aspire 1, and absolutely loved having it to not have to lug around a large laptop for when I needed to get online or work on something that didn't need a lot processing power for.  It stayed my go to for school work or to lug around when I didn't want to carry something heavy.  Then my go to Macbook Pro died.  The Aspire would not pull the load of such an expensive piece of hardware, and I needed a replacement, but didn't have the money to get another one.  I had been reading about Chrome and that it replaced programs with online apps.  I decided to take the plunge, and quickly realized that it was an lifestyle to completely convert to Google.  While I will admit that not everything on the Google network is completely where it needs to be, I will say that being an early adopter, that it gets better all the time, and is the most complete and the thriftiest of the other options, but more on that in a moment.  In terms of what you are getting from Chrome, that doesn't really change from platform to platform.  What you are getting with this version of Chrome, at least compared to the the Acer 710 (The first iteration of Acer Chromebook) is a much sturdier frame.  This is the biggest improvement overall to me, and is even much better than the 720 version.  You are also getting a 2.16 GHZ processor which is a decent size upgrade in processing power, though you are still dealing with 2 GB in Ram and 16 GB solid state drive.  I know this is getting a little bit ahead of myself, but I have read a lot of reviews and comments about the lack of physical memory on this, and how it prevents people from saving files.  If that is how you feel, then you are doing it wrong.  The idea of chrome is to outsource most of the processes to Google, so that very little has to run from your unit.  You get 100 GB cloud drive for free with purchase, that can be accessed anywhere.  I spilled water on my old 710, and thanks to the way that Google works, as soon as I signed into my new computer, not are all my files there and intact, but all of my preference and third party passwords saved on my Google profile.  It was just like signing into my old computer, only this one runs much faster, and has a much better battery life.  It went from 2 hrs, to between 6 and 8 depending on what it is that you are doing.  Another big improvement is the speakers, which are still located on the bottom of the computer, but don't get as distorted when placed on your lap or cloth surface as the older models.  Still not peak sound performance, but much better than before.<br/><br/>Now to the bad.  This first is a minor gripe that goes on preference, but I don't like the keys as much.  My girlfriend has the same model and prefers them to the 710, but that was an immediate selling point for me.  They are still the individually placed keys, similar to apple, but they feel, to me, as though they are slightly more raised, making me lift my fingers ever so slightly more, slowing down my typing.  I wouldn't even really complain, as they are much more springy and feel free to go to a store and try it out yourself.  Now for the unforgivable.  The delete key has been replaced by a power button that is actually part of the keyboard.  I have no idea why this was important for google, as it is a part of all their newer chromebooks, but it really has no function as the notebook powers itself on when you open it automatically, meaning that I have only used the power button maybe twice, and a delete key is just handy for typing and such.  I guessing they were trying to immolate Apple?  The mouse pad is much less responsive, and while better than anything I have found for Windows, it just has the slightest of delays and feels like it just isn't as tight as the older models.  It isn't bad if you don't have the previous model, which was better than my old Apple mouse pad, to compare it to.  The SD card slot no longer completely accepts the card, leaving half the card sticking out.  I have caught cords on similar set ups and broken the SD card off accidentally in the past (with my old Mac) so while this is a feature carried over from the 720, I really wish that they would go back.  Also the 710 had an additional USB port and a monitor hook up.  I also enjoyed the fact that the old power cord had the option to change the plug out so that you could change for what country you were in.  This cord is longer though so it is minor if you intend to stay in the U.S. The biggest annoyance for me was the fact that the RAM could not be upgraded.  The Acer 13 and 15, so named for the size of their screens, both have the option for a 4 GB RAM and 32 GB solid state Drive.  One of the purposes for having a smaller laptop is that I don't have to carry bulky equipment, and while I don't really feel the lag from the lack of RAM now, I also know that this model is not going to age as long, which is really quite a shame considering how much effort you can tell they put into creating a sturdier frame for the computer, that is the best of all the Chromebooks.  It is most infuriating when you think that the older, and slower 720 only had 4 GB of RAM, and it isn't even a choice here.  My last gripe is the lack of choice in color, and I don't really like white, though it grows on you.<br/><br/>Now for Chrome.  Unlike Windows and Apple, this is not made to run "programs"  This means that if you have to download a program onto your PC, this is not for you.  On the plus side, this means that it does not have a heavy operating load and is lightning fast on the internet, which is what it was made for.  Now here is where people seem to be betting confused about how this product was intended to be used, because I hear a lot of people advise that chromebooks are great for people who only want to check email and social networking on.  While this is true, and if that is all that you do online, then this is not only the cheapest and best option to do so, there is really nothing that you can do on any computer that can not be done here.  That does not mean that it can run any program, but that Google has a work around to do any task.  If you want to write documents, then you are going to have to work on Google Docs.  You can still read a Word Doc, or just about any other kind of document (The hands down best feature about Chrome is that it can open and play just about any format for just about anything, without the hassle of updates that you are responsible for) but if you are going to write a document, you will need to write it on Google and have it convert to Word or PDF.  An extra step, but what I am quickly realizing is that Google word is just all around better, not to mention that it is sharable so that many people can be working on it in real time.  Sure, skype doesn't work, but Google Hangouts does the same thing.  I work in media, so one of the biggest things for me was video editing.  There are online editors that work in a cloud, so while I have to pay a subscription, it is actually much cheaper and I don't have to update models every time a company comes out with something new.<br/><br/>This is a lifestyle, and you really have to realize that if you are going to convert completely to Google, that there are a couple of old ways of thinking about computers that you are just going to have to let go and come to terms with the fact that this is a faster, cheaper, and more updated way to use a computer.  The more people who get on board, the better all of these work arounds and apps are going to be, and the idea of paying hundreds of dollars every year or couple of years for software is a thing of the past.  Trust me, you won't be disappointed.
I got this chromebook for my 84 year old mother. I have had one for 3 years and felt that it was a computer she could use and have little trouble with. She has assimilated quite well with it and I am a happy son. Thank you Acer and Chromebook.
****Update - Problem described below was fixed by using a different wireless router.  The problem router was a Belkin, I replaced the Belkin with an Almond router and all is good****<br/><br/>It is everything it is advertised to be......EXCEPT....when I can't access gmail or google search.  Yes...you read that correct.  For some reason and it is often enough to be annoying.  I cannot access my gmail account or google search from my GOOGLE chromebook.  When this happens it is VERY annoying.<br/><br/>The entire reason I purchased this chromebook was to have a fast, instant start-up internet device for those times when I'm late for my daughter's soccer game I need to quickly look up wthe location of the field, or some other last second need to access information on line where a keyboard is helpful.  4 out of 5 time (probably 19 out of 20 times really)  it works great.  But every now and then I click on the gmail "app" button (essentially a button for a hyperlink to gmail) and the the loading bar for gmail only goes part way across and get's stuck!!  I can access other websites in these moments, so I know my internet is working, but I cannot access gmail or google search.  If I wait eventually I get an error message that says "the app is unavailable".  It offers to "provide more information" on the error, but if I click the link for more information bu it takes me to a blank browser window with "about:blank" in the address bar.<br/><br/>And it has something to do with the chromebook itself and how it interacts with the google servers because I've done many tests when this occurs where I run and grab my kindle fire and can easily access my gmail and google search while I confirm they are still unreachable on the chromebook.  I've double and triple checked that my chromebook is "stuck" while my kindle can access these "apps".  Strange huh?  Yes...and very very frustrating.<br/><br/>This only happens 1 out of 5 times...OK probably much less but it is so frustrating it feels like 1 in 5 times.  When it is working it is awesome.  It is WAY faster on-line than my old netbook and is just as fast if not faster than my wife's Mac she is provided by her work.  It boots up in a millisecond and gives me everything I need to meet 99% of my home computing needs in a very lightweight quality-feeling device.  Easily 5 stars if I didn't experience this bug.  And I hold out hope that the constant updates will eventually fix this.
Without getting into what a chromebook is or isn't, I will say that this thing is one incredibly good deal for a portable computer regardless of O.S., especially when you find it on sale (meaning under $199 as of April 2015). I got mine for $129 (a ridiculous deal). It is lightweight, reasonably sturdy (you can't expect it to be on par with something like a Macbook or Pixel quality wise at 1/4 to 1/6 of the price), and has an above average (for lower price points) keyboard and trackpad. The processor isn't the quickest in the world, but it is more than enough to easily handle about half a dozen tabs open at a time, even when one of them is streaming video at 720p (no need to stream 1080 since the screen is only 720). The screen is not great overall, but as good or better than what you find on budget machines (by budget I mean $399 and under). The 2 GB ram is not bad at all considering it runs Chrome OS which is much better at running with lower specs. Don't be afraid of the 16 GB drive because you don't save much on there anyway, and it has an SD slot.<br/><br/>I ran this side by side with my wife's Windows 8.1 Toshiba laptop with an Intel core i3 and 4 GB ram, and it absolutely smoked it. Whether you had just 1 tab open or a dozen, it was better every time. It slows a bit if you throw too much at it, but the Windows machine slowed to a crawl in those situations. For all the people that say "you can't run Photoshop or edit video or play games on it like you can a Windows laptop" I have two things to say about it: 1. Are you likely to do those things anyway? Many people say that, but then they use their machines exclusively for web content, email, and basic word processing. 2. Just because you CAN do those things on a cheap Windows machine doesn't mean you will. Sure I COULD do video editing on my wife's laptop, but it would be so painfully slow that I would give up. And games.... well I have done World of Warcraft on my wife's laptop and got framerates in the 15 fps area on low video setting so sure I COULD technically play the game, but really it is not worth it.<br/><br/>Battery life is insane. I like running the battery down to zero before charging, and with regular use this thing doesn't go to zero for 2 or 3 days. It probably gets 7 or so hours of video streaming, and up to 11 or so hours of web browsing or typing. It does all this silently too as there is no need for a fan and there is no spinning hard drive. No moving parts also means less to break. It has eMMC instead of a solid state drive (eMMC is basically an SD card soldered on the motherboard). This is a bit slower than an SSD, but not significantly. In theory it last less than an SSD but at under $200, how long does this thing have to work to be worth the money? I wouldn't feel bad at all if this thing worked for a year or so and than I had to replace it. If I went out and bought a new $1400 Macbook right now, it would be obsolete in 2-3 years anyway, that is $500-700 per year of use.<br/><br/>The only negatives I have about this thing are the fact that it isn't upgradeable (RAM, processor, and storage soldered on the motherboard) and the SD card sticks out the side of the slot. The first part isn't an issue because it works great right now, and at that price I don't mind dumping after a year or two which is when I'd be looking to upgrade anyway. The second is only a problem if you want to stick it in a form-fitting case, but you can always remove the card when not in use. Is this the greatest laptop on Earth? Not by a longshot, but if you want something easily portable to do your web-browsing, email, Facebook, media consumption, and a little bit of work, and you don't want to break the bank, this more than fits the bill. If you absolutely need to run Windows software, or edit video, or play high graphics games, look elsewhere, but know that you aren't going to get that from a comparably priced Windows laptop, you'll be spending at least twice as much (4 times as much for Apple) for this type of performance.
Build: This Chromebook is super light.  Carrying it one handed is very easy and it's barely noticeable in a backpack.  The keyboard is decent and easy to type on.  The track pad is large enough and perfectly functional.  Finger gestures for scrolling, clicking, swiping, etc work every time and never go off accidentally.  They just work wonderfully.  Speakers are small, but adequate.  I would recommend headphones for any serious listening.  The biggest positive in the build is the fanless design.  This laptop has no fan and barely gets warm.<br/><br/>Screen: All I can say is adequate.  It is completely usable.  It has a matte finish which is ideal.  A normal user wouldn't notice anything at all.  It's just a very typical screen.  It's not a vibrant as a high end tv, monitor, or even a nice smart phone.  But, it is way better than a screen on a $100 tablet.<br/><br/>Battery Life: Under normal browsing, I can use this for several days between charges.  I would estimate about 11 or so hours of on screen time between charges.  Under heavier use, I have streamed video on this for 8 hours straight before the battery warning came on.  Battery life is fantastic.<br/><br/>Other: Boot time is around 5 seconds + 10 seconds to log into Google.  Shutdown time is about 10 seconds.  The Chromebook is very responsive and never lags.  2 gb of ram is just fine even with tons of tabs open, including video streams and things like that.  I have also loaded the 16 GB of storage with video when traveling on an airplane.  Plus, you can load up a big memory stick with additional media and play from that too.  The super long battery life makes it great to travel with and watch media from.
This laptop is great, it's extremely light, extremely simple to use, and overall nice. The price and quality of build is actually quite insane, so I would recommend this laptop to anyone who needs a durable, portable, and efficient machine.
Wonderful laptop!  Great purchase!
The thing about small laptops is that they are handy. They can easily be put inside your bad along with your other things. That's why I bought this Chromebook. Not that it looks like a Mac, but it also has quality graphics and audio too.
Great value, easy to set up and comfortable to use, compact and light weight, perfect at home or for travel.<br/>This is the second Chromebook I have (the other is HP 14) and I am pleased with both.<br/>Shipped rapidly, arrived safely.
Love this chromebook! My other laptop that I own performs well but it is heavy, 15.6 inches, and has a very noisy fan. This Chromebook is great for traveling and class because it is lightweight and silent. Fantastic battery life as well.
We bought two of these because the price was so affordable.  One was for our son who us 8, to use instead of our laptop for his school activities.  He loves it and it has fulfilled all our needs and expectations.  Awesome product!
Great everday computer to go surfing, emailing and reading news. I have a 09 Apple Macbook that I use for heavier work with a new battery I don't want to use up much. This Acer is a great product. Hasn't have any problems so far.
I use this little guy for nursing school. It's light weight, yet sturdy, wicked fast, key strikes feel solid and precise, size is perfect and use of the cloud is easy enough, turns on and off easily/quickly...so worth the price!
If you understand what a Chromebook and what Chrome OS is (basically a browser and not much else), this is a fantastic computer. Running the latest Celeron Bay Trail processor and with Wireless AC, the Acer Chromebook 11 can handle websites, Chrome apps, and Google apps, mostly with ease. The 2gb of RAM does bog the machine down a little. There have been several times I have been quicker to type and get moving than the computer can process. The all day battery life makes up for any disappointment, however.<br/><br/>Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides, along with Google Drive, are competent replacements for Microsoft Office for many, if not most, users. Popular websites like Mint, Pulse, Evernote, Feedly, all have Chrome Apps. And you can easily play Angry Birds or Bejeweled.<br/><br/>I bought this Chromebook as a toy, as I am convinced very few people actually need Windows any more -- get Chromebooks, Chromeboxes, or iPads on the low-to-mid end, and Apple laptops and desktops on the mid-to-high end. When you factor in not needing antivirus on these machines, the little maintenance you need to do on these machines... well, why would you Windows unless you need the latest games on release day?
This little machine is well worth the bucks (especially if you only need a machine for web browsing). I use this device for web browsing, taking notes in Google Docs for work and school, viewing power points and PDFs, email, and video chatting/making phone calls with Google Voice and Google hangouts. I honestly think this device is fantastic (unless you need a high-powered machine for graphics or gaming), so much so that I bought 1 for my niece and nephew for their homework and web browsing.<br/><br/>This chromebook is sleek, light, and fits in most of my totebags. The matte screen is great for reducing glare (and fingerprints). AND this chromebook is super quiet. It makes virtually no noise (unless you put your ear RIGHT on the machine).<br/><br/>The battery life is amazing. I can use this machine all day long on a single charge. That said, I don't like my screen too bright, so I use the lower brightness settings. Today, I used my chromebook all day to check emails, take notes, and do a little shopping. After 10 hrs, It still projects that I have 2 hours left. I also have a Macbook air and haven't used it in months because I have to charge it less than half-way through my day.
This is the perfect portable machine to take on trips. It doesn't run hot and the battery life is great. I gave it four stars because the trackpad feels really flimsy.
I was expecting this to come on 02/10/15, but to my surprise, I received it earlier than expected. I love my Chromebook, it's light and sleek, battery life is GREAT.
This isn't my first Acer Chromebook. I chose this model because it was so easy to use and I don't have to spend a lot of money on Mircorsoft software. Go Google!!
The Chromebook arrived on the day promised.I really love it so far.It is lightweight and easy to use.I would advise anyone looking for a new computer to buy it.
I love my chromebook. It's easy to set up and get going.  It's super fast.  It's lightweight. All of my chrome bookmarks are saved.  I couldn't be more pleased.
This was my first chromebook, and I like it. You have to put in your gmail acount information when turning it on for the first time, but there's also an option to browse as guest. It's quick to turn on, and besides the Google Chrome internet, has icons for Gmail, Google search, Google Docs, and You tube. So it's ideal for anyone who constantly utilizes Google Docs and Gmail, etc., but really anyone can use it even just for the internet alone.<br/><br/>It's bluetooth enabled and has easily adjustable settings, with some nice wallpaper options. It's not touch screen, so you have to use the touch pad but that's fine with me. I like the overall design and the white color. It's slim and easy to carry, so it's very mobile.<br/><br/>Most importantly, I like how everything opens quickly when you click on it. I also had no issues with playing Youtube videos on it. My only issue is my confusion about anti-virus protection. The instructions don't mention anything about it, and the privacy settings in the Chromebook only refer to phishing and malware protection, so I'm not sure if that includes anti-virus protection or not....
Bought this as a Christmas present for my kiddo.....think I'm now a convert as it is fast!  And easy to use.  Still getting used to no desktop icons though.
Using my new Acer Chromebook to write this review.  I am thrilled with the product and SO glad I purchased this.<br/>I would certainly recommend to anyone!
Best buy had this advertised online for 169.99 I bought it, went to the store and they charged me 149.99. This thing is amazing. There are no moving parts (already replaced the fan and hard drive in my 7 year old laptop due to bearings wearing out). The display is led so it should last ten years or more. It's super light.<br/><br/>I love how it doesn't have f1 f2 keys ect, on the top of the keybaord, but to replace those it has brightness (seperate increase/decrease keys) and volume controls (mute, vol up, vol down), so it's very easy to adjust these which I do all the time, compared to going into settings blah blah blah.<br/><br/>One thing you need to know is the touchpad is different - there are no buttons next to it like a regular laptop. So to scroll down use two fingers and you will scroll up/down the page (love it), use one and it moves the cursor. To "right click" (copy, paste, save as) use two fingers.<br/><br/>For basic tasks, this works great. I have been using Unbuntu which has all the compatible office software (word, wordpad ect). I have not tried those on this yet.
So far it's been great.  The battery has been strong, I love this screen, and it is very sturdy.  It makes a strong candidate compared to previous models.
A really good value. Easy to operate. Instant boot up, with no prolonged shut down. No expensive spyware is required. Internet access is lightning fast.
if you are looking for a little netbook to get on internet at once, this is great. It is reliable , sturdy and pretty! Excellent quality and price.
Packaged well. Works as intended.<br/>Is for our middle school child to use at school. So it is nice since its light-weight and so far so good.
I wanted something light, portable, and functional.  I knew what I was getting when I ordered a Chromebook and it's been pretty much what I'd expected.  I wanted something I could browse with, type lengthy documents with, and battery life was important.  Gaming of any type was not relevant to my purchase.<br/><br/>Battery charges from 5-10% and fills up in 90 minutes or less.  Google docs is convenient for me since I'm already using Chrome and other Google products on my desktop.  I enjoy the extra screen real estate from my phone for general browsing (Netflix, etc.).<br/><br/>If gaming anything highscale is important, don't get a Chromebook.  If you wanted something like Terraria you could get a Chromebook that has the Haswell processor on it and run Linux for some basic gaming.<br/><br/>I did buy mine refurbished from the manufacturer. I have a dead pixel on the screen.  Comes with a 90 day warrant from the seller.  Keeping it for another week or so trying to find anything else that may be wrong with it.
I love this Chromebook! It's perfect for commuting college student. It's lightweight and fast. I use it for Kindle books, viewing lecture slides, pdf files and browsing the web. It's compatible with my wireless keyboard and mouse, if you're thinking of using wireless mouse.<br/>The material is plastic and it doesn't attract lint or dust too much, which I value.<br/>The screen is not as good and sharp as a laptop, but still pretty good.<br/>The only downside thing, which was also mentioned in other posts, is that it doesn't run software programs, which can limit what you do. Note that Chrome OS is not the equivalent of Android, either, because most Google Play Store apps don't run on Chromebooks. However, I read in an article that Google is trying to work with app developers to make more apps accessible to Google Chrome store. It doesn't bother me much because I have my phone and laptop to do what this Chromebook doesn't.<br/>Overall, it's good for a college student who doesn't want to carry much too class.
You can't beat this machine. Anyone who needs on-the-road computing, or has a kid in high school or college, this is perfect. It's tough (I've dropped mine on ceramic tile floors more than I can count) and speedy and the battery time is loooong. This is my 2nd Chromebook - first one lasted 3 years and finally the battery just wouldn't take a charge anymore. However - replacing a complete computer every 3 years for under $200 is a bargain any way you look at it. There are plenty of apps, too. Personally, I prefer Wrd and Excel to the Google versions, but there's an app for that, too.<br/><br/>My only complaint - on this version they took away the 'delete' key. So there's an extra step required if one wants to delete something, one has to use the backspace key. Other than that, I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a lot of computing dynamite in a tiny, reasonably priced package. And if Chrombook builders read this, put the darned 'delete' key on the next one! Am mystified as to why they took it off.
I cannot complain. Once you get used to the minor keyboard differences and the touch pad, it's on like hot buttered popcorn. I use it to check email/facebook, bank/shop online, and watch Netflix/YouTube. I did notice that if the machine is running multiple tabs in Chrome at once, there is a bit of a lag (i.e. streaming music while chatting on Facebook). For me, it is great! It is silent, really light weight, and loads quickly. I paid $170.00, not too bad. But do shop around...would I recommend this to anyone who is looking to do more than surf the web? Probably not. It's a Chromebook, so it's optimized to run web apps. I am not a gamer, so not sure how it would perform in that arena. I graduated from college like 5 years ago and have never needed to use cloud storage/Google Drive/Google Docs, so I can't say much in that regard. If you do purchase, I hope you like it! If not, return it, and hopefully you find the right machine for you.
It is actually a pretty good machine.  I'd say better than the 4 starts I gave it here.  The issues I have are very minor.  It doesn't have a delete button though it does have a backspace that does the same job but not exactly the same.  Also, the backspace button you can't just keep it pressed and have it delete and you literally have to keep pressing and releasing it to delete something.  Anyway, you get the idea, I am bringing this issue up simply because I have nothing negative to say about this.<br/><br/>It is very easy to use.  The price for the machine was good (it was on sale for $160 or $170).  The other accompanying deals were fine (cloud space, access to the internet in flights etc.).<br/><br/>If you are looking for a machine to browse the internet and you are looking for mobility, it takes care of those needs.  My wife has to have a keyboard so this works just fine.  I'd consider buying another one if the price is right.
This computer served my needs perfectly and for only $150.  I needed a small computer that I could use when traveling or at home.  I use it primarily to write.  Even though it doesn't really work with software downloaded onto it, it still saves docs and you can write or work on it offline.  It is tricky to download and I've learned that it's easiest to use a flash drive when plugging in my camera to download pictures.  I simply put them on my flash drive or onto dropbox and it works perfectly.<br/><br/>If you want a computer that holds a lot of your docs or pics, this isn't it.  If you can use google drive, ever note or drop box than it will be great.  It is small, light, fast, and does all I need.  I would feel really dumb to pay $1000 more at this point and I was very close to doing so in an Apple store the week before I tried this out.
Fast bright quality Chromebook at a great price.  I just miss touch screen capability but great for what it does.
I did a great deal of research before deciding on what Chromebook I was going to purchase, and I feel like it certainly paid off! This Acer Chromebook is quite a deal for less than $200, with an 11.6 inch screen, 2 GB of DDR3L SDRAM memory, 16 GB of internal storage, and a Intel Celeron N2830 Dual Core Processor. The screen is very bright, with crisp graphics perfect for streaming media, web browsing and editing documents. The whole netbook comes in at about 2 lbs. so its quite light. The netbook is clad in plastic, but the fitment feels tight and durable. I was able to get about 9 hours of life out of the battery before it needed charging, which is more than adequate. I'm very impressed with the quality of Asus products in recent years, and this netbook is no exception. Buy it and you won't regret it!
Arrived ready to go, easy to use, pretty fast. I've recommended it twice now. You can't go wrong at this price.
Bought for my 9 year old sons, they love it and I love that I don't have to fix what they break, software-wise.
It's simple and cheap and fast and it provides everything I want with my computer, i.e. browsing and emailing.
This computer met all of my expectation. Despite its price it is well made. I'm very pleased with my purchase.
Luv it.Does what it's supposed to do.Super light weight and small.Been using all day,every day for a month and no problems or complaints so far.<br/><br/>Battery lasts all day web surfing and watching movies,plus recharges in no time.Haven't found the limit on storage space yet,despite having 10 movies at a time downloaded into the hard drive,and still doesn't seem to affect the performance.<br/><br/>Just took a few minutes to set up out of the box,very easy and intuitive to set up and to operate,even for a tech moron like me.<br/><br/>Took a little time to recognize the wifi at work the first time or 2,but now it automatically connects to the wifi at home and work as soon as it gets in range of them.<br/><br/>I couldn't be happier with a purchase...now Acer...where's my check,lol
The kids and I enjoy the Acer Chrome. I bought two of them and thinking I might purchase one more for a gift.
Does everything it promised.  Great speakers.  Love the simplicity of it.  Don't miss the old laptop at all.
First I have to say that I recieve this item extremely fast. I did the same day shipping (which was about 10$ at the time) thinking that I still wouldn't get it until the following day. I ended up with my package at the front door later in the evening after ordering around 11:30 AM. Now, getting to the point. This chromebook is super fast! I had the Samsung chromebook and liked it so I was a little weary to get this one. For some reason I thought the acer would look a little tacky in white but it actually looks really nice! Not sure if it's actually built much different from the Samsung chromebook but this acer chromebook seems to be built sturdier. Easy to use since it had the same interface as the chromebook. I would honestly consider buying this as a gift for someone.
The first one we received did not work, but Amazon sent a replacement right away, and we like it very much.
Great little computer. I added Linux to it to expand it's capabilities. This makes it so much more useful!
My HP chromebook is starting to show it's wear after 15 months of moderate to heavy use. This week I lost my ChromeOS and panicked, ordered this Acer and I am very happy with it. This unit is half the cost of competing units but still delivers adequately. Buy it! You won't be sorry. Not only is it low cost, almost as fast it has a really resolute display. I was thinking of returning it because I have since learnt that it's easy to reload the Chrome OS on my older chromebook. BTW, all chrome users should make a recovery flash drive to resurrect their OS if it crashes. I was running a dozen sites simultaneously and perhaps overloaded the system. I will soon use a 4 GB flash to load the recovery OS for this unit too. This Acer is a keeper and I'm happy I purchased.
If youve been debating whether or not to buy this to get your feet wet with Chrome OS, you need to do it now as it is currently on sale everywhere I've looked and I get the impression that Acer may be phasing it out since the one I purchased was the last one on the shelf. As Chromebooks go this is definitely not a high end machine by any means but probably the best in this price range. The keyboard, matte display, etc. are all what I would classify as serviceable and perfectly acceptable for a notebook that costs this little. Surprisingly, the small speakers really work quite well for watching movies and videos. Haven't experienced any real hiccups or slow downs using it for day to day tasks. Good student and web surfing device. Get it now before they're gone.
This is a very good computer, and I am surprised it cost me less than $200. It arrived on time, it's smaller than, say, a mac book, but you don't notice the difference at all. The screen quality is great, the keyboard works fine. It has crazy good speakers for such a small machine. It was a little tricky figuring out how to save pictures and access them, and the settings are a little confusing, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly. This computer was designed for you to mostly use Drive; save pics on drive, etc. It's a very light machine, which is nice since l have to lug books around school all day. It's a great computer if you just want something to browse around the internet. Really the only cons are that you cannot save any pictures to the desktop.
It's been about a month and I have zero complaints. Does what it needs to and the battery lasts forever.
Never buying a Microsoft laptop again.  This boots 20 times faster, surfs fast and keeps itself updated.
I bought this for my 9 year old so she can complete her homework after school.  It has been perfect!
Delivery was on point. MY daughter loved it. its nice and clean as described. works and everything.
I was so happy with the first one, I ordered another one for my granddaughter.
I like it very much, light, good battery life, nice screen, etc. I was concerned about readability at my age (65), but no problem. My dislikes have to do with the limitations of the Operating System, keyboard and so on---items intrinsic to all chromebooks.  I never thought I would miss a "delete" button so much.  The conversion of the delete key to a search was a terrible decision IMHO.  I have a number of other complaints but they are in no way specific to this unit which is terrific!
So far this has worked exactly how I expected it for my type of usage. I was able to open pdf files from almost every source EXCEPT one place. My sister is in a program with University of Phoenix online. She attempted to access her pdf textbooks from my chromebook one time and was unable to view the files. I think this is an issue with the school itself because I was able to access my online course content through my local college no problem. All in all I am happy with my purchase, but I can see how the inability to access some pdf files may be a problem for some people.
I usually can pull off my college cojrse load without a laptop but this quarter I needed one. I dusted out my old one from the closet amd it was broken, not overly disappointing I truly loathed it. I went to the store in desperation searching for a something. I was there introduced to Chromebooks. I am the LEAST tech savy person alive. Somehow i have made it 1/2 my way through college with very little typing homework. Its so simple, the easiest laptop ever. The fact I can pull anything from my cloud everywhere amazed me. I loved it. I'm so happy I will be using it a ton!
I wanted a "computer" to take on a long trip.  This Chromebook fits the bill;  although it's not sturdy, it is well- constructed and lightweight .  It is small and easy to travel with.  I purchased a case to add a little bit of sturdiness to it and that helps.  The display is great and the sound is also good for most purposes.  Chromebooks are very different from PCs, so I recommend trying one out before you buy.  For general web surfing and emailing, it's perfect, but there are a lot of things you can't do.  If you go with a Chromebook , this is a great one!
This little machine is pretty close to perfect, especially at this price point! Incredibly light, super long battery life (I am getting close to 9 hours per charge just browsing on medium screen brightness), and plenty fast for browsing or playing flash games. The plastic case does not feel cheap like I thought it would. It has a textured plastic surface that does not pick up fingerprints and feels good to the touch. The sound quality is surprisingly good. Lastly, I was very happy that the screen is not glossy. It does not reflect any glare whatsoever. Buy this now!
Can't beat the price and it works awesome.  Highly recommend.  For those surfing the net and for the use of apps, it is awesome.  Why pay for programs when one can get apps that can do the same thing for free or at minimal costs.  The google docs version word and excel are very close to the real microsoft programs.  Light and sturdy with a great keyboard.  This thing is awseome and very economical.  Would buy another one in the future for other friends and relatives.  Great x-mas or birthday gift.  Youtube reviews for this product were stellar.  They were right.
perfect for surfing, email, netflix - lightning fast.<br/>incredible value.
It's nice to see ultra-cheap "netbooks" coming back strongly. Very often all I need is a cheap laptop to do browsing, online documents, streaming audio/video, etc., and this is perfect, and performs surprisingly well. Add an RDP client or other remote desktop solution, and I can do some work on a real computer very easily, without bringing my thousand dollar laptop with me, or worrying about damage or theft, since this is so inexpensive that if something happens, I'll replace it for less than an extended warranty would cost on a real computer.
So far so good, it is fast, lightweight and just what I wanted a computer just for the internet. Easy setup. I don't use all those word programs so this is great. With my iphone & kindle I couldn't access the full websites I needed, and my old laptop was so bogged down with Microsoft Windows junk it was so slow plus it is 6 years old, it was time for something new. I am usually a MAC person but they are so expensive, and I don't need any programs just a fast internet.<br/>Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is there is no caps lock, that I can find.
Can't beat this for the price.  The more expensive models will be a bit faster for sure, but this handles numerous tabs just fine.  This is a secondary personal laptop I tend to drag along with me - if I spent all day on it I'd probably spring for a nicer model.<br/><br/>I was looking for a model that was so small/light that I wouldn't have to think twice about whether I wanted to drag it along in my bag.  This fits the bill.  The long battery life means that I rarely drag along a charger as well.
Excellent! No complaints, although 8 hours battery life seems a bit optimistic. Certainly 4-5 hours though.<br/><br/>Video playback is super-smooth. Sound is very good. Volume and brightness keys are really nice for frequent on-the-fly adjustments.  The display  doesn't compare to the color and vibrancy of a "proper" laptop, but it's perfectly acceptable and gives that longer battery life, which is what I want.<br/><br/>Now my daughter plans to buy one when she's saved up her money. :-)
I really love my Chromebook even though my fiance would not let me get anything else. Its small, light weight, and has a very long battery life. The only problem I have is that the mouse pad seems a tad bit loose, which doesn't really bother me, but I thought I should mention it. I would recommend it to anyone but as long as they know that it is centered around chrome apps and has to be connected to WiFi constantly. I am still new to it, and getting use to using it, but I have only had it a week.
Nice, compact, lightweight Chromebook which I bought mainly to stream radio and Chromecast tv streams to my tv. The computer was simple to set up and should any queries arise there is an online manual and help available. I had difficult streaming tv fluently using Chromecast on all services except You Tube and I eventually succumbed to linking the Chromebook directly to the tv via the HDMI port and mirroring my screen. This took care of my problem, which suggests the trouble lies within the Chromecast dongle.
For $160, there's nothing to complain about.  Boots fast, plays Amazon videos flawlessly, and is light as a feather.  I bought it primarily for a secure way to log into email, online banking, and online shopping.  I don't want to think about whether Malwarebytes and AV checkers are catching everything they are supposed to.<br/><br/>I bought the minimum spec Celeron model.  Don't see a reason to invest in anything stronger, unless you want an RJ45 Ethernet port or plan to run a Linux distro.
Just what I needed. Super light, cute, does 80% of what I do or more. You can't keep more than 10 tabs or so open at one time without slowing down but its rarely an issue. Speakers are really good considering how inexpensive this computer is. Keyboard great only it doesn't have capslock which is weird but it does have a brightness adjuster and volume control buttons! It even has a reload button, a full view button, a search button, an app toggle button, and a page fwd and bckwd button!
Amazing product, great price for a tight budgeted college student
It's what you would expect in a chromebook.  Nothing fancy, but works very nicely.  Its super light, which makes it very portable.  I teach part time and see only a slight disadvantage in using an all Google environment.  For day to day use, its excellent.<br/>The screen is less than perfect, which is really my only complaint, but really, going back and forth between this device and the Nexus 10, you can understand why.<br/>Great machine overall.  Get one for you and your kids!
So far, so good . . . this laptop has met all my expectations and performed well. It is lightweight and portable, and the battery life is great. I had no issues setting it up and using it immediately. I'm still getting used to the small keyboard--typos are common, but mistakes will diminish with continued use, I'm sure. I use it primarily to check email and access the internet, and it has been super functional and reliable for those things. Very happy with this purchase.
On the initial startup, it said that the "Chrome OS is missing or damaged. Please insert a recovery USB stick or SD card." No such stick or card comes with the chromebook of course and the OS shouldn't be damaged in a supposedly brand new chromebook - very disappointed.
My wife was jealous of my 1 year old C720 which we use at the cottage for internet browsing.  I purchased this so she can have her own with her own google profile.  I must say this is a sleek machine (nicer build with the same specs as the C720 for a reasonable price) I'd even consider dumping my laptop in the city for the 15 inch version.  I think all technology is heading towards the cloud anyways.  We will see what kind of mess windows 10 does to my old acer laptop.
I opened up the nice sleek white chromebook and it came on as soon as I opened it! I followed a couple of onscreen instructions and it was ready to go! I am watching  old classic tv shows on youtube with very little to no buffering.You can make one click and go to your email or google or youtube easily! It also has a long battery life! But, something I don't understand....When you call Acer for tech support they tell you that you must BUY the one year warranty for over $100.00 so you can download special software for them to be able to fix your issues..and for you to be able to call them once a month so they can help you do something (once a month) to keep the computer running like brand new! CRAZZZZZZZZZZZZY!!!!!!!!! I though that it automatically had a one year warranty with ACER at no charge! Did I HEAR him correctly or what???? As far as the computer ITSELF I love it but was I wrong about the Acer COMPANY warranty??? HELP!!!!!!!!!!
My 8 year old laptop didn't die, but it got so sllloooowwwwww. So when I saw this chromebook for $150 I had to have it. I love it. The best things are that it starts right up fast when you open it. I can do everything I need on it, all the same things I can do on my tablet. I like that it is light but tough. The one bad thing is that you cannot print from it unless you have a wireless printer that can link to it. I have a wireless printer but it does not recognize it.
Had it for about three months now. Works great. Easy to use - and I came from a Mac system - and easy to transport. So glad I stumbled upon this small laptop. I'd rather it not have to be connected to the Internet for most everything to work well, but I am learning to deal and it is becoming second nature as to what will work without a connection and what won't. Only other downfall - having to use Google for nearly everything. I kind of like Word... Worth the price.
This is a great little machine. My 6 year old laptop recently died, and was looking for something to have around the house to supplement my desktop/phone. It does everything I need it to with a great battery. Honestly, I bet this fulfills 90% of needs that people who use macbooks have -_-<br/><br/>The price is perfect, it runs simple tasks quickly, I can't find anything to complain about. (The screen leaves something to be desired, but for the price??? cmonnn)
Its a good little computer. I bought it for my boyfriend who was starting back up in college. I am a Mac user so when I use it I really don't understand the chromebook system, and it's something I have to get used to. However he seems to like it. The keyboard is small however and missing some pivotal keys in my mind, like the F keys! Also the speakers are pretty quite and watching Netflix isn't perfect on the laptop. It's a good computer for the price however.
I can compare this to the Samsung as I was trialing both at the same time to decide which I wanted, and this Acer outperformed the Samsung by a mile. This thing is crazy fast. I didn't know pages could load this quickly on any computer! The screen is great, very bright. Battery life is incredible. It's super light and you can sit it on your lap, or on the bed, without it getting hot. It's like a tablet in that regard. Best computer I've ever owned, thus far.
i bought this little lap for mom, who previously had an acer - non-chrome laptop. mom is 80 years old not a total techie, but is sharp and persistent. she absolutely LOVES this this laptop. Her main computer activities are email, Facebook, genealogy research and looking for information on the web. the lack of storage in no problem for her as most of her on-line stuff is cloud-based. she can save photos and documents. a GREAT product for the right customer.
I have used Macbooks, Toshiba, and currently have a Dell laptop for work. I needed something  for use at home to write emails, do internet searches, watch YouTube occasionally and  create simple word documents. This Chromebook is perfect for me. I can do all that I want to using the Google features. I use Google docs to create any documents I need. I have also started using Google hangouts instead of Skype which have been great with talking to loved ones.
Does everything you expect a Chromebook to do.  It's not a laptop, but doesn't cost as much as a laptop either.  Honestly, it is probably what most people need to surf the Internet, make Amazon purchases, other online shopping, pay bills, social media, Etc.  It is light and has a great battery life.  I'm only giving this Chromebook 4 stars because there are nicer and more expensive Chromebooks out there, but this has to be one of the best values.
Exactly what I expected, works great! Delivered in two days!
Excellent product. Good value for the money and functional.
Best purchase ever!!!!! I'm glad I bought my chrome book!!!
This laptop is great for students. While it cant do everything a windows machine can do, for the price tag it cant be beat.Battery life is about 8 hours while watching YouTube and 12 hours when using Google Drive. The keys are well spaced and the track-pad is responsive .Its light and portable enough that I forget I am carrying it.The hinge doesn't feel like it will come off like other Chromebooks I've owned. Overall I give it a 5/5.
It's light, fast and has amazing battery life. It's my go to computer for Starbuck interludes. I have one issue.  A one finger click anywhere on the touchpad equates to a left click. My issue is that the touchpad is so sensitive that my scroll is occasionally interpreted as a click and I go somewhere unwanted. A minor problem and in time I may seek a remedy in desensitizing the touchpad. All in all I highly recommend this Chromebook.
Refurbished. It looks like new and it works great. Thanks!
Replaced an old laptop with this for traveling. Works fine
Actually bought this for my wife.  She seems to like using it as much as her newer Macbook Air.  I have two Chromebooks and they are light, inexpensive and easy to travel with.  Battery life is excellent.  I like not needing an antivirus program for the device.  I like that I can use my VPN service with the device.  This Chromebook didn't seem to allow for adding a larger hard drive, which I was able to do with my older Chromebook.
This is a great little Chromebook. The versatility and battery life make this an incredible bargain for the price offered by Amazon.  I've got a nice laptop, but find myself grabbing this often because it is so easy to carry and has a nice feel.  Even my six year old daughter uses this with ease and prefers it over her other electronic devices.  Yet, it offers adults adults with the necessary tools to function as a great computer.
Way better than an iPad...and way less expensive too.  I recently traveled in Europe with this Chromebook and I've become a Google fanboy as a result.  Fantastic for lightweight work, eCommerce, and web browsing.  Hook up and HDMI cable and you've got a great system for streaming your favorite movies.  I also purchased one for my son who has been using it for college assignments, social media, and web-gaming.  He's loving it too.
One of the two things that I am not satisfied with this chromebook is its keyboard layout which is kind of awkward if you are used to the normal keyboard, and thus, you may sometimes mistype. The other thing is that when I receive the chromebook, the space key is a little bit defective that when I press the right edge of the space key, it does not work.
This laptop is great in terms of what I need it for. I highly recommend it as a backup cheap laptop that you can bring with you anywhere. I bought this as a laptop I could carry with me to class without having to worry about damaging it or needing to charge it. The battery life is fantastic, and it is an easy laptop to use. I would highly recommend it to anyone, if you need one to supplement a more expensive heavy duty laptop.
The light weight is great!  Everything works well so far.
From day one, the camera app did not work.  Repeated attempts to engage with Acer customer service were useless.  The extent of their advice was to restart and powerwash the device repeatedly, then they said I would have to pay shipping on the repair even though the device was defective.
Compact, Powerful, and User-friendly. Is how I would describe this laptop.Ordered this chrome book for my mother and it is exactly what I wanted and more.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Small, but not too small<br/>Very lightweight<br/>Easy to use<br/>10 Plus hour battery life<br/>Affordable<br/>No useless built in software(Bloatware)<br/>HDMI<br/><br/>Cons: None that I have found other than I wish it came in more colors
Quick loadup, the machine is helping me change my way of organizing paperwork, tests, and diagnostic information for school. All of the work can be done on a regular PC or laptop, so making the switch is not necessary. Though, if you're in need of a new device, look no more and get rid of the ties to Windows-based computing. Most of the things I used my PC for I can do on this device, just not caps lock (So annoying).
i love how small and light it is and the screen size is great.. i wanted a replacement for my HP laptop and looked at chromebooks and liked this one the best.. it was shipped quickly and on time, arrived in great packaging and in less than a minute i was set up ready to use it, super easy.. the mouse pad is a little different so it took me a couple days to get used to that, but now i don't even realize it anymore..
Excellent small laptop.  Would buy another one anytime.
The laptop is fast, efficient, and has long lasting battery! It runs well and supplies you with all basic needs for a computer. Although it isn't good if you are needy of a computer with lots of storage, it is perfect for browsing the web and using things such as Google docs and slides. I am using it for school so it supplies me with everything I need to be successful. For the price, you simply can't beat it!
Great buy for the money - well made - fast - long batt. life (very unusual).<br/><br/>Two small problems for me.<br/><br/>1.  The fast power up/bootup is slowed by the necessity of having to enter a google account password.<br/><br/>2.  The type fonts for the toolbars & browser tabs are minute - no apparent way to adjust - I am not talking about web content font size which can be adjusted several ways.
I've worked on it for a couple hours now. Got it as an inexpensive alternative for my kids to access the internet - they didn't need a regular laptop. This works well and quickly so far. I figured out how to have my children be Supervised Users, where I can specify which sites they can access - that works great. I'm a happy buyer, and I can now get my expensive laptop back from my kids before they ruin it.
This laptop is completely awesome for the price, I hope they dont raise the price on you guys because of its awesomeness lol. Its light weight but has a 7 second start up and long battery life. Its perfect forn web browsing and the keyboard makes it easy for a girl like me with long acrylic nails to be able to word process at high speeds. I recommend for anyone looking for an affordable laptop alternative.
Great product.  Light, long battery life.  Great value
Love the color on the screen and the lightweight body.
So far I am loving this little fellow.  Light, comfortable, fast, easy to use.  Just make sure you glance through the intro at startup, will help you find little things like how to do caps lock. It did hang for quite awhile when I started the setup, but I just restarted it and all was well. Worth the little dollars especially if you were already,  or are willing to, put all your stuff on Google drive.
I love it. I was skeptical at first whether it would be useful, but It has become the only computer I use now. I get about 7-9 hours of battery life depending on what I am doing. A couple things to note if you are considering are that this is a small laptop, the screen is small, and if you look at the screen at an angle it washes out, so if that matters to you be warned. Overall an excellent product!
Love his chromebook! I'm not what you'd call "computer literate" but this little Acer is super fast, and easy to set up. I have yet to tap into all of it's benefits & potential, but I am so impressed with the quality and ease when it comes to using this little workhorse! I'm a senior, and have found the key board easy to adjust to. The quality of pictures is superb! I am one happy camper!
I was a little concerned that the 11.6 keyboard might be difficult to use.  This is not the case.  I have been using the Chromebook for a few weeks now and love it.  I am able to do everything I need so far.  I have not used the document app yet and am still learning about all it will do.  I am very happy with my purchase.<br/><br/>The keyboard has a good touch and the mouse pad is responsive.
This laptop is great for the price. Light weight and elegant. Since it is a Google Chrome device I can have everything from my other devices synced into Google Drive and I can access it all from the laptop. The battery life is outstanding, keep in mind I don't spend hours on it at a time playing games or anything. I highly recommend this laptop for anyone looking for a simple, no fuss computer.
I am in love with this little computer! I accidentally spilled water on my MacBook Pro, so I bought this computer to get by until I save the absurd amount of money it'll take in order to fix my MacBook Pro - except now I might just stick with the Acer Chromebook. I really like the matte screen and the sleekness of the computer. I am a student and it does everything I need - highly recommend.
It was everything I've expected when I bought it.<br/><br/>Couple of things I would have like to have changed on the machine that others might like to know before purchasing the computer.<br/><br/>1: no backlit keyboard on computed<br/>2: when you turn off the computer and close the screen them open the screen the computer will turn on without activating the computer power button.
Fast ! Lightweight! Sexy white!<br/><br/>Love it!
Works great, no issues. Touch screen would be nice.
Exactly as advertised.  This little Chromebook does the job and has tremendous battery life.  And you never have to worry about viruses!  This is a no-brainer.  My daughter who is a freshman in high school has been using this since the beginning of the year for note taking, research and writing.  Wish this tech, at this affordable price, was available when I was growing up.
Instant on, no fan, no updates, no anti-virus software. Cloud backup.<br/><br/>For fun I like to wipe everything on it "Powerwash" then see how long it takes to completely restore the working config. Not long at all.<br/><br/>Chrome OS completely changes how I view using the Internet. My wife and I used to use our phones, but this is now the go-to device.
This chromebook is great ! I paid less than $150. I am very happy with this machine. It goes on youtube, streams Amazon Prime and gets on my email and the web. It turns on immediately.<br/>Don't expect a tricked out Macbook Pro and you are happy too. I downloaded some apps for offline movie watching as well. Great purchase.<br/>I would recommend this to a friend!
Love it. Hard to get used to after having a Mac laptop. I think my iTunes collection will remain connected to my old Mac laptop and I can't use Sketchup. But I have gotten my Wacom tablet to work with it while in Beta mode. So light, fast, and fun. Other people mind the narrow monitor range, but I don't mind. very happy with the purchase. Great coffeeshop machine.
After trying several tablets I decided to try this chromebook. I found that this is able to do much more things than the same tablets in the price range. It is very fast, has a clear picture, and is very user friendly. I use this laptop everywhere. With this I am able to watch Netflix, easily play games, and read all my recipes while I am cooking in the kitchen.
Bought for girlfriend (who is not always computer friendly) and have nothing but good things to say. Setup in a few minutes and easy to learn. Works well for study, email, movies, etc. Unless you're a computer scientist, engineer, or other professional, I can't imagine you would need more. Would even work well for most business applications and professionals.
its really light weight and great fpr students because the functionality and portability of it helps with being on the go.The computer boots up really quickly versus normal laptops. The apps that are provided that are usually accessible only through the internet on normal laptops are accessible offline(like google docs). The cloud storage is an amazing thing.
So far, I'm very impressed with this. I previously had the original Samsung Chromebook. The internet on this is way faster and no intermittent wifi problems, like I had with the Samsung. It also is thin, light, and much more solid feeling than the Samsung. And it has a sharper screen resolution and better audio. Can't beat the price on it. I would recommend!
Awesome, especially for the price. Chrome OS is a seamless operating system experience. Though low in price and with an Intel Celeron processor, I have had absolutely zero issues with speed on this chromebook. It works just as quickly for my needs as my Mac. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this product! Plus, for $149, you absolutely cannot beat this price!
Great for what my 63 year old father needed! :)
This is an amazing little web browsing treat !!!  Quick, easy does everything you need to enjoy flying through web apps.  It handles video streaming on it;s own screen and can HDMI output to my 22" monitor or 60" HD TV without skipping a beat.  I love this little thing.  I would / probably will buy a few more so the kids stop snatching this one.
This is a GREAT laptop in my opinion. It is fast to load when turning on and off, the WiFi connectivity is amazing, it is everything I expected and more. This laptop is great for school, work, and entertainment. This size and weight is perfect for someone who is on the go.  If you are looking for something cheap and efficient this is the laptop to get.
It's been a month since I bought this computer. I think it is a great little chromebook and it does exactly what I need it to do. I like the fact that I can use google docs as if it were MS word or any of the office products. Great value for a powerful book! It's also small enough to fit in a purse but big enough to not have to squint at the screen!
I bought this laptop for work. Some people warned against it and said it wouldn't have enough storage, but for what I need it's been great. It works fast, it's light, the battery holds up well. I love using Google Docs to share information with co-workers, all in all a great buy.
Have had this for about a month now and so far so good. Does seem to be a little bit slower than the acer c720 that I own but other than that it runs great especially for its price point. like the fact that the charging port is on the back now makes it a little less awkward than if the plug was coming from the opposite side that the port is on.
This is HANDS DOWN the best item I have bought on amazon.  I LOVE this computer! it does everything you need to do online.  And Google Docs and sheets is good enough for most things for a small business. Once you go chromebook you wont go back, I can not believe how slow my windows laptop is after using this.  I havent picked it up in months!
This thing is really sweet if you're just looking for something simple to surf around on.  You could do a lot with the thing if so inclined, but I have found it does a great job just being a netbook.  Great for using on the couch when watching TV and super easy to travel with.  Exactly what I wanted and has so far met all of my expectations.
my google chromebook does everything i need for college & it's as fast as the brand new pc's in the school computer lab. apps like the ones micro$oft makes you pay for are FREE.& there's always top-notch support available through google help forums. innovative technology doesn't have to cost a lot of $- that's what i call revolutionary!
I am so happy with my new Chromebook! I already used chrome for my browser so using was the Chromebook was easy. It loads quickly, much faster than my laptop ever did. It has all the features I need at a low price. Since I know very little about computers, I was very impressed with all the tutorials provided for it's many features.
This thing is a beast, boots up faster than you can blink, very responsive and very light. I bought the Acer Chromebook because I'm a remote troubleshooter and on-call 24/7, 360 days a year. This Chromebook is perfect for carrying around and not have to be bother by the weight & size.  Oh and it's beautiful, very easy on the eyes.
My two year old c720 died on me (chrome os missing or drive malfunction) and I could not download it to another computer. I turned to Amazon.com for a new machine. I found the cb3-111 for $139. Read the specs (irrelevant cos I only surf). So I ordered it. It is pretty amazing. Others posted the specs, so read email if you need em.
I purchased this Chromebook as a replacement for the previous Acer Chromebook I had(I broke the screen on that one). Though it is an update, I do wish now that I would have just purchased the same Chromebook I had before, I liked it better. There isn't anything bad about this one, I just prefer the one Acer made before this one.
Purchased another. Good for kids and adults
This is a very good computer it works well for me. The only small issue is that the screen is not so bright. I paid 189 and so far I think its worth the prize. The battery life is amazing it lasts for hours . And delivery was fast I got it in three days such a life saver for school projects .Love my Chromebook I recommend it.
I love my chromebook! If you're looking for a no-frills machine that you would only need for surfing the web or doing some work, then this is it! Please take note that there is no caps key, and no delete key (just backspace) -- but I'm not complaining. It is very light, I put it in my bag to go to a coffee shop to work.
We purchased this as a gift but I have a Chromebook myself. You just can't beat the price and quality these little Acer Chromebooks provide. The battery life is amazing, the quick processing, the lightness is wonderful. I find I really don't miss having a windows laptop because this does everything I need it to.
powerful and good , always get compliment
We love this computer so much that we bought a second one.  The reviews are dead on. This computer is fast, light, and fun at the finger tips.  It is money well spent.  I wouldn't hesitate on this purchase.  I've been recommending it to others that don't want to spend a lot but want a lot of bank for your buck.
Love my chromebook. It's super light and has the ability to add apps onto the computer. The only thing I do not like is you are not able to remove the apps if they are not on the bookmark page which is quite aggravating. If anyone knows how to fix this please let me know. Other than that it's an awesome laptop
For a browsing device, this is handy and practical. It doesn't do much of what a conventional laptop can do, but the price is terrific. For what I want to accomplish with it, (casual browsing and shopping) I am satisfied. I've only used it for a couple of weeks, so I have nothing to offer about the durability.
This was purchased for my granddaughter for college, she loves it! Also I did have a question answered by other consumers, and they were very helpful.<br/>I had wondered if this item had the adobe reader on it, and found that it has a built in PDF reader that opened automatically when a document was sent.
Keyboards are always small and take some getting used to on chrome books, but it's worth it. I use this one for everything, it's zippy, and the battery lasts as long as advertised, which is rare! Would be nice if the operating system could use all Android apps without any hacks, but this will comes soon...
Very good one , fast , long life battery
Very good, fast and easy to use Computer
Broke in less than six months! Piece of JUNK!
So far this as been my greatest investment when buying something on amazon, this product will not let you down, very good quality for the price, Im really happy with this chroomebook. If you are a college student trying to find something good that will help you when browsing on the internet here it is.
For my mom's birthday I wanted to get her an easy to use laptop with all the unnecessary stuff. She loves it! She only uses the Internet for Facebook, email, YouTube and Pinterest anyway. Great price for a great laptop! It's a #1 seller for a reason. Very user-friendly for those who aren't tech savvy.
It started out as the best thing that had ever happened to me- just what every college student needs! But, after having owned it for 4 months, sometimes while playing videos or when multiple tabs are open it freezes and shuts down or has to be force shut down. But overall, good qua lit for the price.
This has been a great option for our younger kids as a shared 'homework' computer. So many of the assignments and tutorials are online in Google classroom. The first Chromebook we got shutdown within two days, but I went through the return process (super simple) and the replacement has worked fine.
I'm still getting used to the chromebook, but, so far I really love it! I use it for writing my book and carry it with me everyday. Its lightweight, which makes it very portable. I still have my Ipad also, but I'm glad I ordered the chromebook so now I don't have to carry an extra keyboard with me.
Bought this for my technology-phobic mom, to replace a dying Windows-based laptop.  The Chromebook is lightweight, easy to use, and most importantly for my mother, difficult to mess up (which she frequently did with her prior laptop by inadvertently downloading things, etc).  A win-win all around!
Shuts down when my wifi does, very annoying when in a rough spot. Bought it around Christmas time for around 150, it's good for the price, but if you were about to spend like 2-300 i would just save for a better computer in general.
I love this product. The battery last a long time and I rarely turn it off. For a struggling college student this was the perfect buy for me. I also have apple products and it sucks that I can't download iTunes to manage my music so that's a downfall for me. The only reason it's missing one star.
Got for son for school.  He has taken it every day to 7th grade for 3 months, slid in the tablet partition in his backpack.  He completes most of his class and homework on it and loves it. It is extra lightweight, comes on immediately and battery life last all day - about 7-9 hours.  Great buy!!
Absolutely love. Wether  your a mac or pc user, you'll be spending less time with them and more on your chrome. The Acer seems to be the leader at this time. I see why. Can't beat the price. Don't let the low price lead you to believe it's less than it is. Not the case. You'll have no regrets.
This is a CHROMEBOOK for using CHROME as your os and it works perfect for me. If you are big into windows os and rely on password protected media (password protected thumb drives/external hard drives) then this will not fit you very good as those require .exe files. However if you just use media without password protection it works great.<br/><br/>The interface is very simple and goes hand in hand with google drive. Very little hard drive space but that is perfect for me because all you need is google drive. Plus, i like how easy it would be to reset it if need be. For instance, if it ever starts to lag in the future, i wont have anything stored on the device so i can just easily reset it to factory settings without losing anything due to using google drive as my storage drive.<br/><br/>There is a bigger acer chromebook at around 15" or so but i wanted this one because it is more compact. The screen looks great and ive had no issues with the touchpad. Its super light and doesnt seem to get hot. Ive even used it with the second screen function with my mac desktop and it mirrored my mac just fine. That feature comes in handy if i want to access my mac from a different room and be portable. The speakers also sound great.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great machine and the price is unbeatable. Plenty of apps to complete any task. Also you can google for sites online that are helpful too. For example,  i found a few really helpful websites that edit pictures with many different effects and features. Better than downloading an app in my opinion. Im very glad to have this and use it often. I own an ipad, 4 other laptops one being a macbook, 4 desktops ( one windows and three mac) and i grab this one to use probably more than any of them. Once again, it depends on the task at hand. Most of the time all you need is something simple for email, internet, networking, and small tasks.
I was debating between a Chromebook and a tablet but ultimately decided on a Chromebook so I could resume my writing hobby and have an actual keyboard. This is one of the cheapest ones I've found on here and I've had it for a while and it works perfectly for everything I use a computer for: writing (with google docs), watching things on Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, & Youtube (streams fast with nice video quality), checking Gmail, browsing nonsensical stuff on Reddit, etc. I also will be using it to go on online classes. Chrome has always been my go-to browser and I am not sure if you can download other browsers. It works on googles operating system. I'm used to windows so I thought this may be an issue for me but it wasn't. There are tons of apps like the kindle app which are perfect for reading. The speaker volume is average. I have a noisy house so I like to use headphones. It comes with small mic hole that is on the left upper side of the monitor. I purchased headphones that came with a mic but had two different cables for the headphones and the mic. Since there is only one slot for the headphones/mic in the Chromebook, I purchased an adapter which you can find for less than $10 that allows you to combine and plug in both jacks. Love this book!<br/><br/>Easy and fast to set up. Most of the things on this chrome book, you have to access through the internet otherwise you can't do much. It connected to my Wi-Fi with no problems. If you let someone use it you can have them sign in as a guest and they can web browse.<br/><br/>I don't play games so I have no idea how it works with games. But when I did my overall research it seems it's not a good computer for gamers who like to play things on Steam, etc... Also from my research, there are things like Skype that you can't use but it's a non-issue for me personally since I don't use Skype.<br/><br/>Battery life is excellent. I dislike using the touchpad most of the time so I bought an AmazonBasics 3-Button USB Wired Mouse and it works perfectly with this chromebook (and it's a good price too!). I also bought an AmazonBasics 11.6-Inch Laptop Sleeve and it fits super well. Great price for that too!<br/><br/>There is a built in webcam and I was surprised that the quality is pretty good if you are in good lighting.<br/><br/>Worth every penny! I'm very happy with my purchase.
Has worked very well. Love the size, love the convenience, love the price. Debated between a Chromebook and a tablet - glad I went with the Chromebook with the keyboard. Always starts right up, the battery lasts a very long time and the screen resolution is great. Would buy it again.
Great product.  Just what I expected.
Great for the price. I really love how lightweight it is. I don't like being able to only use google apps but that's what you should no you are getting into before you by a chromebook but other than the Google apps it's great. Very fast. Lightweight. Slick. And has a great look.
I love it.  It's light and quick for Internet access with a high-resolution monitor and a comfortable, responsive keyboard.  This will be my default PC; I've save my $600 HP full-sized notebook for when I need local processing power and larger storage.  A GREAT buy for $150.
Absolutely best value for your money on the market! This simple chrome/net-book completely replaced the need I was feeling to buy a new laptop. I bought one for home use, as well as another for my store to be used by my staff to look up customer appointments (Day Spa).
I previously had a HP chromebook that only worked for a few months.  Then it would not keep a charge. So I purchased this Acer Chromebook after reading a lot of good reviews.  It works great, I love the small size and the small price!  It does everything that I need.
I bought it for my 5 year old to play his games and watch videos on.  He loves it.  My 7 year old likes to steal it away every so often too.  I may buy another one for him for Christmas.  Overall its perfect for this.  Not sure about anything else as I don't use it.
great price , on this great little unit , this is the ideal size , for back to school , or any one for that matter  , if you want to take it with you , take this 11.6 in. CB3-111-C670 Acer Chromebook .  I've gotta stop , starting in sound like a salesman [ I'm not ]
This chromebook is much higher build quality (more durable) than the comparable ASUS c201 which suffers from a flimsy screen backing which allows the screen to crack internally without any misuse. the ASUS customer service is also horrible and cheap. Acer is better
This is a great laptop for students in any grade. It's not too heavy, it's compact but a perfect size. Came on time and worked great. Set up only takes about 10 minutes. It's fast and very useful for schoolwork. I reccomend 100%. Great laptop for a fantastic price.
This is a great computer for kids. My kids use it for the internet only and it's nice and light for them to carry and inexpensive enough that if something happens I won't be devastated. If you just want an easy to use laptop to use the internet this one is perfect.
I love this Chromebook!  I have never had a laptop that boots up and responds so quickly.  I don't plan to store much on the computer itself as that's not what it is meant for.  This is great for browsing the internet and comes with some extra goodies!  Love it!
I have had a problem with gmail reception, but could be my ignorance of system and google advisors rather customers that run the show  .Acer is great. Google is difficult  but I am an older (68) customer so always think maybe i missed something. Hope to conquer!
Excellent value with good service!
My chromebook does just about everything that I need it to. Now I only use my workstation laptop for audio recording and pc specific applications. the video quality isn't great, and sometimes multiple flash instances cause it to freeze, but overall a great buy!
A student showed me her Acer and I wanted one.  It does everything that I need.  How can it be so cheap?  For surfing, checking emails, reading for fun or business, it does it all.  It was so inexpensive I assume that it will just implode one day, but not yet.
Really like it! It came to the house a little faster than I thought. Wish u could use certain software like M.Word and itunes but u cant. Battery life is pretty long and it does not have a caps lock button so for many PC users that is something to get used to.
Bought for daughter and seems to work well.  Only thing is since I bought it for back to school, less than 2 weeks later it went on sale.  Hate when that happens.  Still feel I got a good value.  Anyways, she is happy with it and haven't heard one complaint.
This is a crazy good buy! If your needs are basic then you really can't go wrong with an Acer Chromebook. This thing has amazing battery life, is simply designed and extremely light weight. I take it with me everywhere. Go for it! You won't be disappointed.
My daughter is thrilled. It's better than I expected, and the white angular case of the Chromebook is very sleek.<br/>I have an 2012 Acer Chromebook that I love, but I am getting jealous of hers....especailly the HDMI port for mirroring to the big screen.
Decently snappy, boots quickly, keyboard, webcam, and touchpad feel solid. Worst part is the storage space and build quality, as it feels sort of cheap, but it accomplishes its function easily, and it's cheap enough to justify its price.
Love it. But where's the capslock button and no skype? Haha. Not a bad thing to count off for it. Thia little thing is need. I hate that you can't use skype on it but the hangouts app works well....with people who have hangouts or gmail.
this is not a laptop  it is a very good tablet  and priced better than tablets  there is now drive  but it works well to watch movies on  or let the child watch her shows on  while i can watch my shows  i feel it was a very good purchase
SUPER LAPTOP i got this product at low cost from here  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MMLV7VQ/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=9325&creativeASIN;=B00MMLV7VQ&linkCode;=as2&tag;=amazonbfc-20&linkId;=QZAX32FHXHAPUFX2
I really like this chromebook! :) It loads REALLY fast, and it has looooong battery duration. Plus, it's the newest model of an ACER chromebook. Very good price as well (even cheaper when you get Amazon Prime). Totally recommend this!
Durable and great for kids,  my two girls use these everyday and it holds up to pretty good abuse.  They don't overheat and theres no fan intake to block on the bottom. this is a perfect chromebook for almost anything you would need.
Just what I needed love it....
Works well overall.... but sometimes it freezes and forces a restart. Not too big a deal usually as I haven't lost anything and can be back online within a minute or 2 MAX but still a little irritating. Not bad for the price though.
I got this computer for writing and going on Pinterest, and it's doing both exactly as planned. As someone who is not made of money, it honestly makes me so happy that you can get a functioning machine without having to spend 500+.
This chromebook is excellent. It is attractive and works well, and it seems like it cost a lot more than it actually did. The keyboard is just the right size and is comfortable to type on. I can't imagine a better value for $139.
I like chromebook and it is perfect for my use, primarily for on-line internet, e-mails, and banking.  I would like to have a laptop with the disc drive for dvd applications and a lighted key board for use in the evening bedroom.
I purchased this Acer Chromebook to serve a specific need and it more than fits the bill....Extremely fast for a computer in this price range....I've purchased other Acer products in the past and I've never been disappointed.....
I Like the Chrome Operating system because it is a sign of the future. This particular Chromebook is small but with an easy to see screen. Even the Power adapter is white.
I bought this as an experiment to see if I want to switch from a PC to a Chromebook.  So far so good.  It IS noticeably faster during startup but not breathtaking for normal tasking.  For the price it's certainly a good value.
Love it! Lightning fast, great for all things done online. Screen is small, but I knew it would be. Display still great and crystal clear. If you're ok with surfing the web on a small screen, you WILL NOT regret this purchase.
I really like this notebook. It boots up quickly and has pretty decent speakers. I like that it has Bluetooth capability, because my old one didn't. I wish it came in colors other than white without having to pay extra for it.
Liking it so far!  Very fast.
I was really impress by the Performance and how easy it is to use. It's light weight. The Price is Awesome!  It came securely Packaged. I'm able to watch My You-tube Videos etc. And I'm Very Satisfied with this Chromebook.
Excellent laptop.  Works like a charm, is light and small, and a breeze to use.  Long battery life, and does what you need.  I wish the keyboard illuminated at night, but that's a mild issue. It's a perfect travel laptop.
Love my Chromebook!!! In the evening I can leave my desktop and continue in the living or bedroom with my Chromebook. Lights on or off.. it doesn't matter. The keyboard is so slick and quiet. Awesome!! Highly recommended.
I ordered this after seeing my friend's. It is all that I thought it would be, just perfect for my needs. It keeps me connected when I'm away from home and I don't need a regular PC.  and I love watching my Movies on it.
This has been a fabulous computer for our teenage daughter! Inexpensive, very fast, and lightweight. We are considering buying another for our other kids to use. This is our first Chromebook, and we are very satisfied.
Perfect little device for my 11yo entering middle school. This is our 2nd Chromebook and I really like this newer model. I worry a little about a drop with the mostly plastic shell but a nice carrying case should help.
I ordered this laptop for my husband and it has been the best thing that I did. He has no knowledge of computers. so this gift was perfect. If you just want to log on to the internet. This is for you. Very good laptop.
Excellent.just what I need to shop,check e-mail and facebook. Holds a long charge and it is very easy to use.Light weight feels like nothing in my lap unlike my vaio laptop. Well look into getting one for my grandsons.
First one gave out on the 29th day no power would not start up. Amazon did an exchange with no problems just hope this one lasts. Overall very light weight no fans does not get hot great for the web or watching Netflix
Best computer I've ever had!
Wanted wireless computer to use outside on patio. After some research decided on this Chromebook.  Very happy with performance and physical quality of unit.  For this price it is great.  I don't often review products.
Been using this for college homework and studying as well as music, YouTube, Netflix, and general web browsing. It hasn't caused me any trouble for the 2 and a half months that I've had it. 10/10 would recommend.
Great product; great price!
Quick start, no problem. I like how compact and simple this is. Everything is stored on the cloud so if you need to access something, be sure to either transfer it over to your small HD or be connected to WiFi.
For the price, I love it! I use it for daily internet activities and it works flawlessly. Plus, at this price, WHEN my son breaks it, I will be significantly less bent out of shape than if he broke my MacBook.
Some say that it's the most overrated laptop today.. however, in my opinion, it's not.. if you ever had the chance to try its features.. then you might change your mind. great product in a reasonable price!
This was for my 12 year old son, who loves it and uses it every day.  So far it has worked perfectly. I'm thinking of getting one for myself as they are so light and portable.  I do love my iPad, though :)
I got this machine a placeholder until next year, when I start a better paying job. I assumed I'd have to change it for a more versatile laptop, but the truth is this suits my purposes just fine. Basically, I need an internet browser and access to Google docs. I don't play games, write any programs, or work with any visual media.<br/><br/>This laptop has helped me realized what I need from a computer: google docs, google chrome, netflix, and a search engine. There's really no need for me to spend a great deal of money for anything more. I'm probably not going to upgrade until this laptop falls apart. It has superb battery life, it's silent, and it has so few background stuff running that it doesn't overheat even on the odd Sunday that I might be wasting on netflix.<br/><br/>If you're the type who plays games online, makes videos or visual art, or generally need the power to run lots of esoteric programs, then this chromebook is probably not for you. If, like me, you just need an internet machine, then this is worth every affordable penny. The only thing I kinda of miss is a touchscreen, but not enough that I'm eager to pay for something else anytime soon.
My wife has been using this for about 4 months. Iit replaced a old 2009 MacBook that she spilled coffee on. It has been quite acceptable for light duty use, such as video streaming, e-mail, Facebook, etc.
Very lightweight, connects fast to wireless and a pleasure to work with.  It's the perfect internet browsing device if you don't want to use your desktop or laptop (very comfortable to use on the couch!).
Still working on using it.
Super fast!  Already have cloud access for photos and Office 365!  Lightweight, too!  I also have an Acer netbook for a hard drive and programs.  Incredible battery life!<br/><br/>Definitely would recommend!  The price is right!
Great for my children who are 10 and 17. Set it up in minutes. It automatically updates and that is huge for our family. We love this Chromebook.
Just as I expected it, it's light. Runs very fast/smoothly. The camera is okay. I love that it runs by my google account. That's what I love about it the most & of course great price!
A good option but not the best option depending on your situation. This Chromebook is a solid choice and physically well built. It's sturdy and attractive for the price. However, it is noticeably slower with a much shorter battery life than the Chromebook I had before this one which is this ASUS option -  http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VUV0MG0?psc=1&redirect;=true&ref;_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00 - The ASUS option has gone up in price since I bought it but there seem to be other ASUS options with similar specs. The ASUS Chromebooks are physically a little flimsier, but I would recommend an accident protection plan for any Chromebook. My old ASUS (before I broke the screen hinge) was perfect for me. Consistently fast and a crazy long battery life. It was worth the extra money for me.<br/><br/>This Acer Chromebook is still a good choice for someone who doesn't mind the shorter battery life, prefers a sturdier build, won't have more than a few browser tabs open at a time and wants to save that bit of extra money.
Perfect, basic chromebook. Does what it's supposed to, does nothing it wasn't designed to do. Very happy with this product, sure beats using my smartphone for all my web navigating.
This computer loads up faster than my Android phone. I always log in as a guest so everything is sandboxed to avoid viruses. It is the best internet surfing device I have every had.
I have one tiny gripe with this Chromebook.  It only comes in easily scuffable white. Actually, make that Inevitably scuffed white.
great price for product
Good for my skill level
Awesome computer!!! Exceeded my expectations. It's well priced for what it does, I can travel and access all my cloud drives. Amazing battery life. I bought one for my girlfriend.
This is a great little machine.  Very light weight, nice screen, good speakers. Plays media and games fast and consistently.  Long battery life. Great price. Very happy with it.
We received the laptop quickly.  It has an outdated operating system so it would not connect to our WIFI.  After my husband contacted google support (for 2 hours) it works now.
met or exceeded my expectations.  Arrived on time, intact. The chromebook needs more help features for those unfamiliar to Chrome. takes too much trial and error and giving up.
Good looking, good quality. The only thing is the screen is so small, the font is hard to read at times, but not enough of a nuisance to take away a star. It's worth the price!
Everything I expected it to be! Internet connects everywhere in the house, even better than my Ipad Air. Keyboard has very good feel and response. Very Happy with the purchase.
The chromebook exceeded my expectations. I have a laptop (windows), an ipad and a kindle fire. The chromebook has become my go to device, I use the chromebook 98% of the time.
Literally never spent a better $150. Great display, and goes toe to toe with the Samsung chromebook my sister got a few weeks ago. Best entry level computer I've come across.
For the price, this isn't a bad little machine.  It does everything I need it to do when I'm travelling for work, and is much smaller and lighter than my personal computer.
Received it two days earlier than anticipated and it perfoms exactly as it should. Great for streaming and tweeting and emailing and any other tasks you need to accomplish.
Nothing comes close to this fine machine even at a much higher price.I'm on it every day and it simply goes like a race car.I love every thing about my Acer 11 chromebook.
The screen keeps blacking out! Im afraid its not going to last me long even though i just bought it less than a month ago!
Bought this for my 12 year old grandson.  He took it straight from the box and started using it immediately.  It's fast and easy to use.  A great computer for the price!
I followed the setup instructions. There is no manual just a simple two page instruction sheet. After inputting the setup stuff the thing will not go to the next screen. I accessed the web site for further info but no help. Am returning this piece of junk. Lousy product and extremely poor customer service. Will never purchase anything from Acer again
Great value, for general note taking and internet surfing you cant beat this deal.  However, if you want to do anything beyond that,this may not be the product for you.
A great laptop for the price. My only complaint is that it will not allow my iPhone to connect to iTunes. I'm unsure why this is fact it works great on everything else.
Product works great for what I use it for.  Extremely fast, easy to use.  I wish google office had a few shortcuts that excel and word have, but overall,  works great.
A great little computer to have and use anytime.  Thinking about leaving me dinosaur behind, and ordering another for myself, as the first was a gift for someone else.
For the money( less than $200.00 including shipping) I don't see how you can beat it. Processes super fast and opens right up at a touch with absolutely no lag at all.
The product was in excellent condition  when I received it at my door and I love working  on the Acer Chromebook , I have to get used too work on that small computer.
The product works well so far, but I only set it up and used it enough to do a little test.  It's a Xmas present for my 7 year old.  It arrived sooner than expected!
Love this Acer Chromebook!  It is fast, clear, small and easy to carry with you.  I would recommend this little chromebook for web browsing and emailing it is great.
A chromebook was needed for my child's middles school, school year.  My child loves it and navigates the programs with ease.  The battery life lasts all school day!
This laptop is perfect. It's light weight and is easy to carry. The picture is great I just wish you could adjust the brightness of it. Other then that I love this.
The Chromebook was everything that I had hoped for!  Fast, smart, light weight.  There are some things I haven't figured out how to do yet, but I'll figure it out.
I love this laptop. Its lightweight, way faster than than dell and has a webcam. I bought for college and was looking for lightweight, efficient and fast laptop.
No problems. Works great, if not better than my <br/> it was replacing. That one had a faulty trackpad, so I had to return it.
For what it is and for the price, a very good value. Very light and portable. Good for web browsing and web apps. YouTube videos play smoothly. A good purchase.
absolutely love this. so cheap, fast and portable, i have one dog on either side of it while i type! love it! probably not good for a ton of photos or files,etc
I absolutely love this. It's light weight, sleek, runs fast and is the perfect college note taking and essay writing device. I'm very happy with this purchase!
My 10 year old needed one of these for school. It works great. It's fast, easy, battery long lasting and she loves it. Does everything a regular computer can.
bought 2 for kids entering high school. great little machines for what they need. their school provides gmail accounts so all their data will be in the cloud
Works great and is pretty fast for the hardware, but be let be be known that the more Web pages opened, the slower the machine will move just like any other.
Battery malfunctioned after 45 days, just outside of return period.  Would not buy again, but school requires light chromebook.  Badly made.
Does what it's supposed to very nicely. I haven't figured out to do much offline, including printing. But I will persevere when I have time.
I Love my new Chromebook<br/>love the battery life<br/>and especially love the lightness and compact ability it has<br/>Highly Reconmend
It's a great little computer. Outstanding battery life! Only criticism: speakers aren't very good, so I hook it up to external speakers.
Good laptop for the price. Got it for my boy friend for he can do his homework. Works fast. The only down fail there's no place for CDs.
Love my little chromebook for using when I'm on the couch or traveling.  It's handy for my web browsing, etc.  Nice lone battery life.
I purchased this for my husband, who is technologically challenged. He can use it easily and is very happy with it. Perfect price too.
I just love it!<br/><br/>BUT I'm a Google/Android fan. It's smooth, easy to use, light weight and startups up faster than Windows.
Excellent item,  very nice finished, excellent price, could be very nice to keep the product updated, and a new model touch-screen.
Works great, kids use it for homework because it is the same kind used at school.  They no longer have textbooks they use laptops.
Small enough to travel and not be obtrusive, big enough for home use. Good battery life, sleek design. I am really happy with it!
Outstanding laptop. Simple to use,  very fast,  does everything you need.  Great keyboard and mouse.  Chrome/Google is the best.
love this little machine..it's very light weight , very fast, good battery life without recharging..it is as good as advertised.
Love this Chromebook! Great build quality for plastic. Lite weight, great keyboard and fantastic trackpad. Great camera as well.
This laptop's so powerful, you can play lots of games using this one. the best laptop from Acer! thanks for this great product!
computer is inexpensive, does what I need it to do and doesn't give me any trouble.  Wish my wife and dogs were as reliable.
easy to use and very fast compared to my old system.  I like the security and not messing around with downloads and updates.
I thought it was great! Unfortunately, my wife didn't, and had to send it back; didn;t have the funds to keep it for myself.
Love it!  Just what I wanted.  Looked up on YouTube how to do stuff.  Does everything I wanted it to do. Would buy another!
I recently purchased my Chromebook. Very nice. Easy to set up. Types smoothly, working fast. Just the right size. Love it!!
This is just awesome! Highly recommend it-Acer is one of my favorite manufacturers, and the Chromebook is super fast, easy
It is a great computer. Takes a little bit to get use to, some of the features are alot different from a windows computer.
Yes.....buy this small computer.  Perfect for travel.  Everything I need for quick internet searches and storing my docs.
Perfect little notebook. No problems and no complaints. Huge bargain. This is computer I have spent 30 years waiting for.
Exactly what I was looking for in a chromebook.  Works like a charm, great little size, and does everything I need it to.
I've yet to be disappointed with a chrome product...this new one's battery life is amazing!  I'd recommend it to anyone!
We've bought several of these for our school. They are durable, great battery life, lightweight, and work as advertised.
I didn't think this chromebook was going to be large enough. I was pleased with the size and at $140 it is a great deal!
Very impressed with my Chromebook. It's very easy to run. I enjoy all the features.  I would recommend this gor anyone.
I love this!  It works great, and does just what I need.  A good value, and I've had no trouble with it after 3 months.
Came in super fast. Love the way the keyboard feels. Absolutely no problems at all. Very happy with this product
Perfect for on the go "internetting". Honestly to whip it out and take notes real quick, its so perfect.
Fantastic little machine!  Very versatile, I could not be happier with this purchase - especially at the price!
Excellent fast boot lightweight , perfect for quick on line access when I only have a few minutes to go on line
My chromebook is everything I wanted it to be-easy to use-lightweight-holds a good charge. I'm delighted w/it.
Works perfect for checking email and browsing the net. That is all I wanted it for and it has performed well.
Love the Acer.  Could not beat for the price and it really is a great little laptop.  Would highly recommend.
Bought this for the kids to do their homework on. Great price and a great product. Speedy, good screen, etc.
love it for just what it is, its simple very nice screen, camera and this is all I need this for that's it .
I love my new laptop! If you're looking for a good laptop at a low price this is the one you're looking for!
still using it as my main "laptop" now! :) Really convenient to bring around because it's so light.
Bought as a gift, but opened it and checked it out before. Seems pretty awesome, and now I want to buy one!
I tell everyone to get this. Sleek, fast, reliable, battery life that even the Energizer Bunny would envy.
Love this thing.  Gone is my old outdated windows 8.1 POS and now I have this which is fast and wonderfull
Bought for my 14 yr old daughter.<br/>This thing is super fast!<br/>Price is a steal!<br/>Well built!
This computer is great for the price. It does seem to freeze up often, but works well for my 8 year old.
Everything seems to be working just fine on it. I saw a lot of mixed reviews, you get what you pay for.
It works so fast and free of waiting for programs to load.  I am enjoying the book very much. jim meyer
Yes, I love it.  It more than meets my expectations and beautifully serves the purpose I wanted it for.
This is a fantastic device.  The screen is beautiful, the keyboard is so easy to type on, the mic/camera are excellent for a cheap laptop, and it feels durable (like its made from quality materials).  It connects to wifi and blutooth devices automatically.  Most importantly, I have experienced ZERO slowdown in a month, and it's as fast as the day I bought it.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an alternative to a tablet (those who like keyboards), or anyone who needs a secondary work device for travel.  Especially for writers.
I love my Chromebook. It is perfect for my needs, browsing the internet, shopping, email and facebook!
Arrived on time and happy with the performance of this chromebook it might be old but the WiFi is fast
Very nice computer chromebook. Built well and nice looking. Just learning chrome OS learning quickly.
Love this chromebook! Super fast, display is bright, speaker is loud and perfect size for my bag.
Great product! Received it in a timely manor and was exactly as described! Perfect for our needs.
All is good except cannot use skype n yahoo messenger. The cam can only be used in gmail hangout
I am beyond happy and very pleased with my purchase, turned on immediately, very fast browsing.
Met all of our needs for an easy internet connection for travel.  Lots of extras<br/>built in.
Bought this for our daughter to use for school. Great quality & does everything needed & more.
Very lightweight and powerful machine.  The battery life and charge time is very impressive.
It is effortless to use and does everything I need -- and it was an excellent price.
My only complaint is that you can not use it unless you are someplace that has Wifi.
Everything went great! Package came as promised in great condition. no complaints.
very good. serves the purpose. I bought it for 6th grader..  for him its perfect..
I've only had this laptop for a few days, but I already love it! I have a MacBook, but it's too heavy to carry in my backpack to class with all my schoolbooks. I saw one of my friends got a chromebook and couldn't skip out on buying one; especially with such a great price. It is very light weight, perfect for internet browsing and taking notes in class! Would recommend to someone looking for something simple and inexpensive.
Wonderful value for the money. Use it every day.Bought the square deal warranty.
I am so excited and happy with my purchase and  service provide to me. Thank You
Bought for my legally blind sister. She loves it, it is so easy for her to use.
Works great!! The battery lasts a long time. Super light. Very good for college
Inexpensive. Great for classroom use. User friendly. Good deal for an educator.
Love my chromebook! So portable! I take it every where!!! Light and convenient!
Perfect for what I use it for, basic browsing, light gaming, and photo editing.
Love this Chromebook. No viruses, ultra fast boot time. Great battery life also
Light, Little, and quick.  I would recommend this little beauty for everything!
Nothing, but praise! For a college Laptop this is the most bang for your buck!
Love love love!!! So easy to use and just absolutely love this little laptop!!
Great computer for my senior in high school. Does everything she needs it too.
Its wonderful. I just don't like the fact that EVERYTHING is done by internet
Everything I had hope for! Light weight, and easy to use! Perfect for school!
So light and easy to take wherever you go.  And no software to buy!  Love it!
works very well for what I use it for...I hooked up a wireless mouse to mine.
The acer chromebook 11is. Great and I'm enjoying my acer and i got it on time
Great at first but the mouse/touch pad keeps messing up!!! very frustrating!
So far so good. Had it for about a month or so and it hasn't failed me yet.
It's very nice product. Very light weight, fast and easy to use. I love it.
Love this little notebook. It's go everything I need and want. Great price!
good laptop that merges budget and quality into one. nice design on it, too
Bought this for my 14 yr old granddaughter for her homework. She loves it.
Light, quick and does what I need it to do. Especially good for the price.
I bought two of these. They are both great, with exception of the trackpad being kind of weird on both of them. The best way I can describe it is that it seems to have some play in it where it needs to be double clicked even for a single click. Not a deal breaker at this price point, but definitely deducts points and as a result it's a four star rather than a five star machine.
Bought it for my daughter , she is a senior in high school. She loves it!
Light weight makes it perfect for wife's bedtime emails and web browsing.
I love it, nice and convenient with the size of it and real easy to use.
Good machine, and a great value, though it could be a bit more powerful.
Great for emails and listening to Pandora while I'm on my exercise bike.
My aunt loved it perfect laptop for people who just use the internet :)
Enjoy it, works great, works great off my mobile hot spot on my phone.
Lovely laptop. Check out my video review: https://youtu.be/riua2YlBWxk
Excelent product, small and easy to use, perfecto for basic necesities
Pretty solid little computer for cheap, though it has its limitations.
I didn't get very far with the set up process and will be returning this computer. I bought it mainly to use on the road to access my work site which requires Java. Turns out Google Chrome doesn't allow Java to be downloaded.
The Chrome book was also for my granddaughter and she loves it also.
Exceeded my expectations great for streaming  and basic office tasks
I love it. It perfectly fine to me for writing. It is good to carry
Easy to use..lightweight....perfect for surfing the web on the fly.
Exactly what I needed and at a fantastic price. Highly recommended.
I'm going to take you through a full day with this machine how I use it, and I'll give you a little bit of insight on the product along the way (especially the hardware).<br/><br/>Let's start with the battery life. If you plug it in overnight, you're golden. Depending on how much you use it, you'll be good to go for a full eight hours of screen on time. However, I use if for little things throughout the day -- for example, it's my lunch period and I need to write a paper for my AP Language class -- and I can get between two and three days, if not four, of battery life without charging again.. This Chromebook charges fast, albeit I still plug it in at night. (FYI, the light can be a little bit bright and bothersome once it turns blue, the color to indicate it's on/charged. If you choose to charge it in the room you sleep in, simply place it face down.)<br/><br/>Fast forward a little bit, and I'm at school. Group project? No problem. Depending on if it's turned off or in standby mode, it will take no more than eight to ten seconds to boot up, ask you for your Google account password, and open the web. I personally connect it to my iPhone's personal hotspot, so I have the web EVERYWHERE. I go to drive.google.com, navigate through my labyrinth of folders (most of which are filled with my Google Docs files (free), PDFs of scans from my iPhone's scanner app [Scannable], pictures, etc) and create a new document. My group works on the project, share it with everyone, and go to my next class period. By now, five to ten people are mystified by how light this device is, and how good it works for what I do.<br/><br/>Fast forward just a little bit to my TA period, where I'm helping a teacher teach his class. I know far more about technology than he does, but he just got a new phone and would like to transfer pictures. With the right adapter (I just happened to have a micro-SD card adapter and he had a USB cable), you can transfer pictures through the Chromebook to other devices, the Chromebook itself, or anything else you can think of.<br/><br/>Fast forward to after school, when I tutor other people for my AP United States History class, and my Chromebook is out on the desk. I have open a PDF of the notes, a PDF of the scan outline, and I'm still using Google to search the web for things that I may not know. I can show people pictures, my notes, etc... all with little to no effort.<br/><br/>There's no fan. There's no heat, really, even when using graphically intensive tasks. The whiteness of the shell doesn't SCREAM 'weird', but more like a slick "this is something different" kind of look.<br/><br/>While I'm writing this review, there's a few other things I would like to mention. The keyboard is a DREAM to type on, and I can consistently reach around 70 words per minute. The screen isn't ugly or obtrusive, but it works. You COULD watch Netflix if you really wanted to, but you're probably better off watching on your smartphone or on a television. The touchpad... well, there's an issue with the touchpad.<br/><br/>Maybe my Chromebook is just a little defective (and that certainly could be the case), but it's gotten a little TOO clicky for me. When I gently press down, it doesn't meet my finger, it flexes a bit... actually, more than a bit. It's not horrible, you can still distinguish a click from a little press. However, I turned tap-to-click off because of this little issue. Also, I changed the scrolling style to reflect how a Macbook would perform: natural scrolling. For some reason, Google wanted to be special and call it "Australian Scrolling."<br/><br/>There's two other big things to address, and these are the obvious, white elephant things about the Chromebook.<br/><br/>1) The obvious absence of a Microsoft Office suite, which I'll address in a minute...<br/><br/>2) The lack of proper printing support.<br/><br/>Google has remained mostly inactive when it comes to coming up with printing solutions for the Chromebook. They seem to want to FORCE YOU to use their solution, Google Cloud Print. But, there's other plugins on the Chrome Web Store. For example, there's a plugin on the store by HP, Epson, and I believe a few others. The HP one is certainly buggy in all respects, sometimes flat-out refusing to print. The solution I use is to use the Chromebook way for everything else: put it all in the cloud. If everything is in the cloud, you can do more than access it from any device, you can print from any device; I use my iPhone to print in the Google Drive app and the individual apps for Docs, Sheets, and Slides.<br/><br/>Microsoft Office is a big absence from the Chromebook ecosystem. Breathe. You're going to be just fine.<br/><br/>This is a device you throw in a backpack, not a desktop publishing suite (yet). Yes, there's a Microsoft Office web app, but what can you do with it that is any better than Google Drive? Take the jump, and you might feel especially comforted by the fact that the Chromebook comes with 100 GB of free, Google Drive storage, and documents created in Docs, Slides, and Sheets don't even count towards your storage. Also, you may not have noticed, but almost everywhere on the web where you can upload files, you'll see a "Choose from Google Drive" button right under it that works better than uploading. This is especially true if you use Turnitin.com like I have to.<br/><br/>That's it! That's everything you might want to know if you're a student wanting this device. If you have any specific questions, feel free to comment. I'd be more than happy to help you.
Awesome!
Amazing Chromebook. I have had many but for the money is the best.
I love mine! Highly suggest this Chromebook to anyone looking into buying a Chromebook. I went from using my MacBook and realized this was much better for surfing the web and everyday things. For the price and the quality of this Chromebook I highly recommend it. Great for college students as well. I take it to class with me everyday.
I bought this for my mother and at the price it is great quality!
Really nice chromebook, small and fast. Battery last for a while.
perfect for just lounging or laying in bed and surfing the net...
Been using it for a little under a month, it's been great so far!
Great for the price, shipped on time. I couldn't ask for better!!
Works great for schoolwork and shopping, the reasons I bought it.
This is really a great, value-for-money, product. IMHO, Chromebooks are rapidly advancing from just being content-consumption devices to content-creation devices (especially, as far as office productivity tasks are involved).<br/><br/>I do hope that Acer helps speed-up the adoption of Chromebooks among the general population.
Bought for my son, he loves it.  No issues with speed or memory.
I got it for my 5 year old for homework, works perfect for him.
Thanks so much for the quick turn around!!!!  You're the best.
Exceeded expectations, fast set up and processor; in spite of the gurus distaste for the Chrome generation; they are here to stay!<br/>My only reservation- if I did it again, next time would choose the 13" screen.  Acer, Asus, Toshiba all good; Samsung is bringing<br/>on faster processor so will be very good.
Not what I was looking for (my bad) but it is a nice machine.
I worked right out of the box and did everything it promised.
Such a great device!  Incredibly lightweight and easy to use!
Bought this in July and the screen LCD has malfunctioned. No crack or any damage but the top left part of the screen is distorted making the laptop unusable. I cannot return per Amazon's policy. Completely disappointing. I have 2 other Samsung Chrome books that are working great 2 years after purchase.
Lots of fun. Easy to use. Extremely portable. A great buy!
great product and great price, came in perfect condition.
It's great when it worked and I like the concept.  BUT after only owning 6 months and under normal use at home the screen has gone bad.  It is useless as it just shows lines.  I guess you get what you pay for and it might be worth spending a little more for a better built chromebook.
Amazingly capable and easy to use machine for the price.
Great product battery last over 8 hours great chromebook
My 7th grade daughter is very happy with the chromebook.
Great mini laptop for my daughter. She has no complaints
smaller then thought, having problem seanking to printer
Both my kids have it and it and it works wonderfully!!!
Like it so far but still learniing how to best use it.
Mad can't play online poker.really good for the price.
I am very happy with this purchase. I use it everyday.
For an inexpensive Chromebook it is a great purchase.
Item as described.  Very lightweight and easy to use!
Love it. This is second chrome book. No complaints.
I am a teacher and have all my materials saved on Google drive.  This devise allows me to work anywhere with wifi.  It is lighter and faster than my laptop.  In addition, it is so inexpensive that I don't have to worry about damaging it.
Takes some getting used to but worth the effort
I love it, it's my go to machine for everything
I guess I have simple internet needs and this Acer Chromebook was my first chromebook. Although initially concerned that it wouldn't function as well as my previous larger laptop, I have absolutely no complaints. It's been great.
I love it all I need now is a wireless printer
son loves this and you cant not beat the price
The Acer Chromebooks are an ideal solution for classroom use.  They are lightweight, portable, and with strong internet connectivity, have very quick response.  The reasonable price makes them affordable for the school setting.
Very light weight and convenient, very beautiful and sleek looking. There is no caps button so its similar to using a mac. great if u hate technology like me and just need to use the web. you can type docs on your gmail doc.
Good Chromebook. Great quality for the price.
So far so good. 10 yr old daughter loves it.
Don't like the speakers being on the bottom.
Great little chromebook  works as advertised
Great for basic use and surfing the Internet
I needed to get my 9 year old a Chromebook, so she can surf her favorite kid websites and do school work, and I become hooked after using it!  I am blown away by the raw speed of this thing!  Boot up time is like 4 seconds, and web surfing speed is fast... much faster than my late model Windows PC's!  In addition, no anti-virus or anti-malware software is needed, since Google O.S. is apparently immune to hackers!  Am I DREAMING?!  For those of you who want an inexpensive, fast, and secure way to surf the internet, with built-in security, look no further.  These Chromebooks and Chromeboxes are AMAZING!  Of course, you don't have the full functionality of a Mac or Windows system, but since more and more computing is now done online or on 'the cloud', this is the wave of the future!  Also, if you have a family member, perhaps an elderly parent, or a 'special needs' brother, cousin, etc. who is not computer literate, and just need to use a computer to web surf, these Chromebooks and/or Chromeboxes are the way to go for sheer, problem-free simplicity!
Great buy. Grandson loved it.  Easy to use.
there is no capslock key...it throws me off
The recipient is on Cloud 9...she loves it!
Third Chromebook. Best buy for the money.
Purchased for granddaughter she loves it!
My niece loves its for homework projects.
Perfect for our son's internet interests
So much computer for such a low price!!!
Easy to use, our granddaughter loves it.
Great computer, very fast a lightweight.
Great value for my 11 year old daughter.
Exactly what I expected and works great!
great value. just what I wanted it for.
I just needed a computer to get on the internet with.  Great for that.  I wouldn't be as happy if i was trying to use it for anything other than the internet.  Nice size.  quick start-up.
the fastest notebook I have ever used,
Great buy for the price.  Easy to use.
My daughter Loves it
Daughter loves it. Delivered FAST !
Great product,  promptly delivered.
luv luv this..take to work and etc.
delivered as promised, works great!
works nice for kids to do homework
Works Great! My daughter loves it.
Good product. I love this computer
omg i want to marry it im in love!
My grandson loves this Chromebook!
My daughter is very happy with it.
Worst computer ever, I've never hated a computer more than this one it has caused me nothing but a damn headache since I received it.  I tried to give it a shot but it's been 45 days and I still hate it, rarely will it connect to my wifi and lord forbid during the time I'm trying to connect it will ask me 20 times the password that should be saved already.....so damn frustrating I will NEVER recommend or purchase a google chrome book....ugh
Nice chrome book my first took awhile to get use too but having fun with it and would recommend to others, I use when we go on vacations or traveling works great.
I really like this notebook, and when I went to buy it at best buy I was told that I couldn't just download anything is it isn't apps and that everything was web-based, so when I actually started using I wasn't really surprised. however, one thing that really pissed ne off about this is the fact that, in order to use the Google play apps, you need to have a Android device, not only that, it has to be from an specific list of devices, it's not like you can buy just any tablet that has google play that it works out, and since I only have apple products, that was very annoying. I am happy with the product in all other aspects, don't plan on returning it because I like the price, the size and the weight and there are a lot of good apps at the Chrome Web Store.
What more can I say?!  I love it.
so awesome. Perfect for traveling
Came with out a operating system
still works, great for internetz
So far pleased with ease of use.
Awesome computer for the price.
Wonderful, just what we needed.
I love the laptop perfect size
Won't go back to windows based
Great product at a great price
Awesome! CANT BEAT THE PRICE!
This is perfect. A must have!
Little, light and pretty cool
perfect for writing my notes
just got it and no issues..
What a great chromebook!!!!
Affordable and trouble free
They are working out great!
Very good computer. love it
worked better than expected
Love it, love it, love it. Very fast, easy to use, and very low maintenance, especially compared with Windows machines. Very light. Long battery life.  Extremely good value for the price.  Couple of minor issues:  the touch pad on this model is just so-so; the lack of a caps lock button and delete button takes a bit of adjustment at first, but once you adjust it's fine. Overall I love it, love it, love it. Still might need to keep a secondary Windows machine for some applications, regrettably, but I'll drag myself back to Windows kicking and screaming only when I absolutely have to.
It worked fine for the 1st week. Then it never powered on. No one from Acer could give a solution. Thoroughly disappointed.
Love the size and security
Small lightweight and fast
Works well for the price!
Great product. I love it.
this chromebook has exceeded my expecations.  very quick bootup, speedy web browsing, and automatic, real time saving of documents in the "Cloud", these have all exceeded my expectations.  and i love the full keyboard and how light weight this unit is.
Love my Chromebook. :)
for grandson, loves it
Love this! Super Fast!
I gave my husband mine and had to get a new one.  He loves it and I love my new one. Thanks Amazon.
I bought this laptop as a gift for a senior in college. She loves it! She says its a perfect size.
My daughter loves it.
My daughter loves it!
This Chromebook is easy to set up and use.  It automatically imports all of your google and chrome browser settings. After turning on, it powers up very fast and is ready to go in 8 to 10 seconds.  Was concerned about screen, but found that the screen viewing is very good and 11 inch screen is good size.  Very light and portable.  If you are looking to surf the net and read mail, this is a great solution.
Absolutely love it!
Excellent deal!!!
As Described, Arrived promptly. Very Pleased. Can't Wait to play with it!!
Great all around
Could not have been better for what I needed it for! Great Notebook!
Very nice item!
First class unit that easy takes the place of both laptop or tablet. Well made, easy to operation with great functionality. For most work, including access to Microsoft Office and email, this unit works as well and as fast as a laptop costing 5 X more. As an intermediate platform for travel and daily use, it can replace most of tablet functions (though not apps). That being said, news is that Acer is not going to be producing the Chrome OS too much longer and will replace it with the Android OS. Hopefully, this tool will continue to work well during this transition.
good note book
This was a very good buy.No problems at all.Good job Acer.
It's a good laptop, however the mouse pad is not the best. The right click does nothing but highlight things. You have to peas on both sides in the middle to get all tho prions like copy and paste. It's light and has a fast load up and turn off time.
I love this laptop. It's the perfect size & lightweight.
great valee, great product, very happy with this product
This laptop is amazing, and I mean amazing. I was very skeptical about buying this chromebook after my friends and other sources incessantly told me that "a chromebook is just a browser". I will admit that this is true, but if you need a laptop for travel or just a second laptop for home and all you want to do is browse the internet, I couldn't recommend this laptop enough for you. It is definitely a steal for its price, I would be willing to pay upward of 350 dollars for this machine.
Upon purchase, this Chromebook was fast and fluid, just like my old Acer C720 was before it, but a few weeks ago it started becoming very laggy on sites like YouTube, where HD video would have constant freezing and sound cut outs. The scrolling on all websites also seems to lag quite a bit. The trackpad is very clean, so that isn't the problem, and my internet is very fast, and I don't have this problem on any other of my computers, so it is the Chromebook that's acting up.
I just got this yesterday and absolutely love it!!!
This was a great purchase!<br/>My Apple IMAC had crashed, the infamous blinking folder, and I needed something quick and at the lowest price possible. I turned to Amazon, did some research, found the ACER and, since I use Amazon Prime, went for it. I mention Prime because I saved on the shipping.<br/>Anyway, this little Chrome book does the job and at the price I am Impressed with it's quality.<br/>I had to let people know...
love it!!!!
The Acer CB3-111-C670 ships without SeaBIOS and no custom firmware is available (yet) as of June 1 2015. Check https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Chrome_OS_devices/Chromebook for Chromebooks that support Linux installation and monitor https://plus.google.com/communities/112479827373921524726 for possible custom firmware for devices with BayTrail CPUs like this one.<br/><br/>Five stars because you get what you pay for.
I love it.
I love it. Works great. Long battery life, light and durable. I had a more premium HP 11 but it was slow, had a terrible battery life, wifi dropped out and had charging problems. This machine has none of that. Does everything it is supposed to and had impressed me so far. I use this as my travel laptop when I go out of the country and I also write on it as well since it is so mobile.
For surfing the Internet this thing is awesome.  Much better deal than a 500 to 700 laptop for basic stuff.  Very happy with this purchase.  Built in Mouse pad is the worst feature (not that great of quality) but am getting use to it.  If it was too bad I would just order a high quality cordless mouse. Still 5 Stars because of price / overall quality.  You can't beat it with a stick
I like it. Very fast and streams perfect.
I love how it's simple, start up and shut down is fast.  This is the perfect computer for just wanting to jump on the internet! I am extremely happy.  I have had all kinds of computers.. laptops, desktops, notebooks, Windows ME, Windows XP, Windows 7 and 8. If you just want something light weight to carry around and hop online with, this is perfect.
Very happy with product. Good prices !
Love this
Excellent
Love it!!
Like it a lot.  Well worth the money.
Perfect size with great battery life.
purchased for grandson & he loves it
I'm very happy.  The Acer is well-built, solid, stylish, and enjoyable to the touch.  It is much better than the Samsung Chromebook I had previously, which inexplicably crashed.  Found a seller, paid no sales tax or shipping, and got it for under $170.<br/><br/>If you want a Chromebook (do your research), get this one.
It good for a high school or grade school student. For a college student this isn't the best laptop to use. It's limited to chrome and internet explorer for browsers. Most schools want Firefox web browsers for lesson plans and lecture. Other than that if you want to spice up your instagram page this is a great buy.
good2go!
Amazing!
Works perfectly i love it 😍😍😍
i so wanted to like my first Chromebook - i really did.  at the end of the day, I think i had my expectations waaay too high...i thought at the very least, the speed of my web browsing would exceed my 2.16Ghz Core 2 Duo Macbook (2007 - i mean it's been 7 years, come on) and it felt the same to me.  I'm probably too hard core of a Chrome user - i love being able to switch users quickly - i actually found a feature to do this on the Chromebook but it's not quite the same as having separate user accounts *each* with multiple Google accounts - on the Chromebook - they are mashed together and filling up the front screen with 6 Google accounts I have on the browser I'm using right now... I prefer one laptop login and then having access to multiple Google account - this clearly minimizes security risk.<br/><br/>to give this netbook some credit, the camera is better than my MacBook - i notice it deals with low-lighting really well.  It also has *great* battery life - to experience what it's like to be able to use a laptop for like 8-9 hours is incredible - it's a totally different ballpark!  this is the kind of laptop you'd use next to the TV for sure.<br/><br/>for kicks, I did put it into Developer Mode to see how well it would run Ubuntu.  now props up to the developers for allowing it to switch to Linux *without* rebooting (wow) - i wasn't able to get the installer for Skype and TheBrain to work and unfortunately don't have the bandwidth to figure this out right now - i was hoping they would just work the first time w minimal fuss.<br/><br/>I also tried to install new apps like Evernote and while no fault of anyone - it's just a rough port from Android and unfortunately as an iOS and Mac OS X user, it really pales in comparison.  but this is software, I'm sure it will be get updated over time.  it's just not the replacement I was excited about after attending Google I/O 2014.<br/><br/>the keys and trackpad felt pretty sticky - my workaround is to use my bluetooth keyboard & mouse - then i discovered bluetooth pairing is *super* flakey [esp w bluetooth speakers that work find on iOS & Mac OS X] - in fact, it's what I would expect of a developer product - this is when I realized this product isn't ready yet & put a nail in the coffin - it needs another 2-3 years.<br/><br/>our family has a Chromecast and thought this would work without a hitch - nope.  it got really confusing fast -  it was unpredictable whether it was going to mirror the screen, cast the video stream...  then once you get it working, it's not clear if the playlist has been put in the queue because it's giving you a button to add the list to the queue - it's a complete mess.<br/><br/>while this is more of my being indoctrinated by the Command key on a mac, it drove me absolutely batty to have to use Ctrl all the time (so you Windows converts need not worry)<br/><br/>at the end of the day, I realized I guess I'm the kind of user that needs to shell 3-6x for a MacBook Air and have the flexibility to run mac, Windows, and Linux.  it's hard to put Google at fault for $200-250.  I got mine for $150 and thought this would help make this product shine a bit more for its price point...but nope.<br/><br/>other last bits -  the power nib on the back seems super flimsy and seems like it might crack easily if you hit it the wrong way... the power brick is larger than i thought ( i guess i've gotten spoiled with how small the Air adaptor is now...)<br/><br/>oh - for some reason you can't sleep the unit while the SD is in.  every time i woke up the unit (it does wake up fast btw), it complains i have to be careful not to take out the SD without ejecting (or something along these lines)<br/><br/>ok - i hope that covers a lot of different moving parts.  again, I know a Chromebook is not meant to be compared against a MacBook -i just had a raw wake up call where those extra dollars go... I hope it helps someone make their decision.  that said, it's very promising what this platform will do a few years from now - just give it time!
I love my new Acer Chromebook.
Love it
Awsome!
Great!!
Love it
We love our Acer Chromebook!
Good buy for what it cost gave it to my mother for Christmas my only problem with it is its basicly a tablet with a USB port gets great battery life and the fact that it has built in blue tooth is great syncs right up to sound bars and stereo headsets
I looooooove my Chromebook!
Great price! $164. My last Chromebook cost $250 { 2 years ago}. A no frills laptop, but gets the job done.
When I flipped open the machine, I was greeted with a message stating, "Chrome OS is missing or damaged." According to the Google website and a member of the Acer web community, a reinstallation of Chrome OS, through a process called recovery, is necessary to get the machine functioning. The process seemed pretty straight-forward, requiring the creation of recovery media using a USB flash drive or SD card. However, each time I tried to create the recovery media on a Windows desktop, the process stalled and ultimately failed. This is very frustrating. I would return the chromebook, but I can't find the packaging. Even if the recovery process worked, I'd still rate the computer 1-2 stars because it should come with an OS pre-installed!
This is a great computer.  The whole family loves it, with the exception of my older child because you cannot play Minecraft or Skype.  I very rarely use my desktop anymore and it cost more than 3 times as much as this Chromebook.
This is my first laptop ever for myself and I love it. I'm able to do everything I need. Only stinky thing is it doesn't have a CD port???? But it's pretty great. It came the day after I ordered it and set up was super duper easy.
I bought this as graduation gift for my granddaughter. She will enter college next month. She has used the  acer and is quite pleased with it. I think it is  perfect for a freshman to have, starting out on a college journey.
So far so good. I love how fast it starts up and I can use it for 90% of my tasks. The keyboard takes a little getting used to but the build quality is solid. I find I keep grabbing this instead of my laptop.
I like it so far! I'm still figuring and learning how to use a chromebook after having a laptop, but it's fun! It's small, the battery last FOREVER and speedy! Connects to the internet right away; I love it!
I had to return this. The wi-fi never worked and it turned out to be a software issue.
Light and easy to use
The Acer Chromebook is perfect for my needs.  It's lightweight, compact, and very easy for an amateur like me to use.<br/>Mine is white and cute as the dickens....my friends are all jealous!
The power adapter on this won't stay plugged in.  Super loose and falls out quickly.<br/>Also the casing feels very cheap.  Granted this is a $150 laptop, but it feels cheap.  For example one slight bump will crack or pop the casing.<br/>Also it is port layout really sucks.  There's a port on every side and the back of the chromebook.  You have 1 usb and sd port on the left, then hdmi and power outlet on teh back, another usb and headphone jack on the right. You almost feel like you could be wired out the arse with ports everyone.<br/>Also having the power adapter port on the back, or any port off the back could be damaged if you use this as a "lap" laptop.<br/>Remember the old adage you get what you pay for....you buy cheap you get cheap
I got the Chromebook to take with me when I sit my grandkids a few times a week. I have 2 other laptops, but they're a little cumbersome to tote around. I liked the 11" size and the $199 price. However, one of the main uses I wanted this computer for is to play Big Fish games with the kids. We love playing them. But to my utter disappointment, I can't download any games from Big Fish. There are a few in the Chrome store, but they're not top quality, and the screen is too small. You can't run them full screen. You can also play online from the Big Fish site, but again poor selection and small screen.<br/><br/>For many users, this isn't a problem. But for me, this is a deal breaker. I'm keeping it only because I ordered 2 HP Stream 11s in a row, and both wouldn't connect to my wifi, so I had to return them. I don't want Amazon thinking I'm crazy by returning a 3rd computer within 2 weeks. I just ordered the Toshiba 11.6"  laptop (not a Chrome) because I need a Windows based computer for my needs.<br/><br/>All the speed etc. on this Chrome doesn't help me if I can't use the programs I want. The no external download thing is a major turn off for me.<br/><br/>So if you like to play casual games with a full screen, forget buying a Chrome.
Very good chromebook
great
Worth
Very good chromebook. I am a little disappointed that chrome does not have Snapseed that Android has. The photo processing apps are a little underpowered. Maybe I'm missing something?
Great price.  Long lasting battery.  Decent screen.  Attractive shell.  I found setting it up a tad complicated.  I also don't like that I can't move my apps all over the screen.  It seems like a waste of surface to me, but some might like looking at their favorite photo without fonts all over it.  However those cons were minor.  What made me take off two stars was the mouse pad.  I found it cumbersome to use.  Even worse, it stuck on one side after minimal and relatively gentle use from an adult.  It really requires a separate mouse (so another expense and item to carry).  I'm going to return the one I have and, with the hope that  I just got a lemon, will order another.  I will update when I receive the new one.
It freezes up sometimes and I have to restart several times a day.  Not sure what the problem is.  The keyboard is small.  I got an external mouse.  It's ok for what I got it for.
Love my Chromebook!
I wanted to give 5 stars for this product but Acer's customer service isn't very good. I just got this product and was very happy. However,  I had a problem so I chatted and called online with Acer customer service. They made me wait more than 2o minutes.  I indicated my name and they were typing weird name on chat line. They used non professional words too. When I called them, the representative didn't seem to understand what I was asking. He sounded like he was not paying attention to my question and saying the wrong things. I got really good deal with this product and I am happy with it so far but I don't think I am going to get anything from Acer because of their customer service.
13 yr old granddaughter loves this little guy. It certainly doesn't do the job her mom's Apple did, but she is very happy with it and her mom is happy to have her Apple back.
I really only purchased this device for the 2 years free of Google Drive storage and at such a low price it was a good opportunity to see what Chrome OS is all about. Initially my realistically low expectations were more than exceeded. Unfortunately to reach such an affordable price, they had to use the cheapest hardware around. For me that means a camera that doesn't work and a wi-fi card that can't seem to stay connected. Without a reliable wi-fi connection this thing is basically useless - which is where I'm at right now. Apparently others have had better luck, so it still might be worth the gamble to pick one up and hope you get a good one.
Absolutely love this Chromebook!  This is perfect for surfing, blogging, streaming video, & reading.  I recommend it to everyone that asks about tablets vs laptops.
I like the computer, I wouldnt want it if i was doing super secret missions that needed a number pad.  I happen to enjoy its small compact nature and its simplicity
Very very little memory, all data storage is online. Has a nice camera, it's stylish in appearance and lite weight. Best as a started notebook for a 5th-8th grader
Great for travel!
I have been enjoying my Chromebook laptop. So far so good. It's fast, it's lightweight, and I can take it with me everywhere I go. I highly recommend it.
I picked this chrome book up yesterday mainly because of the hdmi output because my wife and I cut cable and watch some tv shows over the internet.  After using the chrome book for a few hours yesterday, I absolutely love it.  It does everything I wanted it to.  It is fast, much faster than I expected it to be.  It is very stylish.  I had done no research before I bought it at Best Buy on an impulse buy but after reading other reviews and using the computer yesterday and today, I think I hit the jackpot of chrome books.  I love this thing.
Update: I received my replacement laptop within a couple of days and the tracking pad is not loose. I love it! Thank you Amazon. It performs great!<br/><br/>October 14: Just got this beautiful laptop today for my birthday. Just wondering if the tracking pad should sound "loose" when it is clicked.
I bought two of these, one for me and the other for my sister. Both refuse to connect to any Wifi. it just keeps disconnecting and connecting. I am trying every fix i can find on the internet with no solution.
worked perfect
My husband bought this for me for Christmas and I love IT! I love the light weight of it. So much more then I expected for the price.
wouldn't boot, when it finally booted, it kept dying and crashing, like some fish from the bottom of the oceans depths that just couldn't handle life out here in the sun lit real world. The refurbishers who sell this refused to accept responsibility for this turd, They apparently are only responsible for collecting the money when it passes through their hands, if anything is wrong with it, its the fault of the people who handed it to them. Rather than wasting time arguing with these shyster idiots trying to get my money back, I simply went and bought an ASUS C201, which arrived a few days later, and sprang out of the box like a happy puppy, all dancing and happy and shiny eyed, and running around the internet doing what a good chromebook should do. Like night and day.
I got it for kids to use for school. It's a bit too plastic and light, like cheap toy... It does work ok and holds battery...
No complaints
as advertised
THIS LITE WEIGHT NOTEBOOK COMPUTER IS PERFECT AS A CHAIRSIDE RESOURCE. I was skepticalABOUT WHETHER IT WOULD SERVE MY NEEDS-
This newest Chromebook keeps crashing.  I had no problems with the last gen, but this one is buggy and crashes all the time.
We have only had ours a few weeks and now it has started to lock up and won't turn off without a long wait.<br/>We can't print from it, our printer isn't cloud or whatever.<br/>No Skype, just Hangouts, which nobody I know has and I can't expect everyone to change just to suit us.<br/>Difficult to delete stuff, why can't that be simple.<br/>Glad I still have my 7 year old laptop.<br/>Just not having Skype would have stopped me from buying this if I had known.
Liked my Samsung chromebook very much and this Acer chromebook seems just as good with better battery life and costs less.
Simple, all html based. If you are having issues using this, then go buy an ipad (which are really for children anyway).
I'm in love with this laptop, it's a wonderful computer... Super fast and great battery. A lot of good things to say.
Junk junk junk acer is sub par i got mine to day after an hour black screen of death.will be returning for a refund
It's basically a pad...no real word program. Good to take on a trip for a way to use the Internet for searches..
Generally like - google apps a bit hard to navigate, sometimes has trouble connecting to our wireless internet.
This is my second one, after my first one got kicked across the room (accidentally, and not by me.)
First one  that came had no os and couldn't function.  Replacement seems to be working fine so far.
These are excellent computers for most purposes. We replaced our old hard drive with two of these.
Great! Bought it as a Christmas gift for my mom. She loves it. Great little laptop for the money.
GREAT GIFT
Works great! and also connect to N band which is a way faster internet speed compared to G band
I loved it!! I've been using it for 10 months now and no problem at all!! Highly recommended!!
Everything is fine except it cannot connect with my classic printer that is not convenient .
I got the Acer chrome book for my granddaughter,and she loves it..very nice and easy to use.
This is a good tablet pc, but mine reset itself several times before it crashed all together. I liked the setup though and it was easy to use. If your wanting the full functionality off a computer this is not what you want. If you're looking for something to use in addition to another computer then this is great for that purpose.
This Chromebook works works most of the time, but other times, it freezes and turns off.
small, efficient, reasonably priced. Purchased as a gift and recipient was very pleased.
very nice
The two of them were purchased for our grandsons and they are very pleased with them.
Great small device. Super fast with the flash HD. Much better than I was expecting.
perfect for my 70 year old father who only likes to google search and facebook.
Not meant to become a full time computer, but great for mobile and light duty.
It's been plugged into the AC for 3 days now, but every time I unplug it, the battery dies in less than 30 seconds. I guess it would be portable if it came with a 50 foot extension cord.
It is time consuming to install some programs in order to start using it.
Can't get it to plug in. Plug doesn't seem to fit in the hole of the side of the Chromebook. Any suggestions?<br/><br/>edit: ooops, there is a hole in the back edge I didn't see. My bad. Will rush home and try it out and correct this review if it works :)
Fast ,does everything I want to do and does it very well. Great value.
Very good.. Which internet explorer was on it but other than very good
amazing update of the former unit.unit.deserve to be know world wide.
I have only had my Chromebook for a day, but I absolutely love it. I use a computer for e-mail, paying bills, facebook and shopping on..you got it...Amazon. Due to medical issues, I need a very lightweight laptop and this one is great.
Confusing at first but once you get usto it the probuct is good.
My first experience with a Chrome Book is not a disappointment. It starts up fast and working in the cloud is seamless. I don't care much for Google's apps though; they're not compatible with Microsoft Office.
Love this little thing! So light and turns on super fast.
It's a Christmas gift so not sure but I have high hopes
off to a roaring start. arrived today. turned it on, connected it to wifi here at work went through a few screens, and it has been stuck on configuring for the last hour.....  not sure what to do. hope things get better or it is going back.......<br/><br/>update resolved the connection issue and it is working great!  connected right away when I got home. when you open it, it comes right on. great deal for what I paid for it. super light weight,keyboard is a great size. all in all I am very happy I bought this.  thinking I might be liking it more than my Ipad!  I use it for going online and facebook only. nothing else.  I did buy the extended warranty, just in case.
My husband bought this. He loves it. It's easy quick
Happy
Excellent computer for general purposes. Get one.
Good quality and somewhat durable for its price.
My old Acer computer was going loopy, so I needed a new one and there was two I looked at.  The Acer and the Samsung chromebooks.<br/>I came very close to buying the Samsung until I saw this one, The Acer 670 chromebook lll..  For $179 bucks  I coundn't pass on it, so I bought it...<br/>MAM O MAN, is this thing nice !<br/>FASTER, OH YEA !!!<br/>Boots up in less than nothing,,<br/>Picture is outstanding, sound is outstanding, use is OUTSTANDING..<br/>My little Acer notebook laptop dust in the wind..<br/>I like the bigger screen, better color, no loud fan to put up with..<br/>Only have one problem though..  Forgot my dang password, believe that ?  But that's what happen's when you become an "ol coot"..<br/>I checked a week later on the price and I couldn't believe the cheapest I saw this computer was $249..  WHAT ?<br/>My buddy got his Samsung last year for $200 bucks and thought he got a good deal until I told him what I got..<br/>Some people try to compare is to a high dollar machine and some get mad cause it doesn't have a cd drive, and it won't print out and it won't use microsoft hardware and I just shake my head at em..<br/>As for me, "two thumbs up and wiggle my toes", OH YEA !<br/>There are things on here "I" don't have the slightest cluse what they do or how they work, it's like a learning curve for this ol coot.<br/>If you want something more than this machine, something better, something that will make you go awww, then dig a little deeper in your pocket and get it.  Don't buy this and then start to boo-hoo cause some wacked out sales person talked you into buying it.
my husband a novice is enjoying this immensely
i want it and i ordered it and it looked good
great item. cant get enough of it.<br/>TY
THis weighed less than my 7" tablet and an  lightweight external keyboard did, starts near-instantly, runs forever on a battery charge, etc. There are many limitations to a Chromebook , but you can't beat something like this for the price.<br/>Downsides: processing and even viewing photos seems to tax this thing. It crashes occasionally and is certainly slowed down far too much by the simplest photo file transfer operations from the SD card or from an external hard drive.
Machine did everything I expected. The keyboard is responsive; system is fast; and access to needed software excellent. Glad I bought  it.
I love my Chromebook. Simplicity is key.
Fast delivery ,good product . Thanks.
Love the size, however disappointed that the majority of the apps are no longer supported by Google. (youtube, java, adobe)
Great little chromebook
My daughter loves it!
Great little laptop!!
Got this for Christmas last year for college. It was just what I needed so I thought. It's light weight, battery life was great idk maybe 7 hours, basically good for web surfing etc. Downside.. It doesn't support things I used daily such as iTunes, Skype and Microsoft. The fact that I only had a online version on word sucked cause I couldn't work on homework without wifi. I'm now looking for a new light weight laptop that supports Windows so I'm not held back. Also I've never dropped it or anything and it just flat out stopped working 2 months ago so I didn't even have it for a year and it died on me. Won't charge or come on I researched other people having that problem and its happened to a lot
Very sleek and nice.
Kids just love this.
Love this Chromebook
Great chrome book!
Grandson  loves it
Sheer awesomeness!
awesome investment
Exactly as described.  Shipped promptly.  Works great!
Use it every day
Just love it!!!
great product.
so far so good
So far so good
No delete button!!!  I can not believe how much I used the delete button until I did not have one with this product!  Poor design!
Awesome deal!
Good product.
good web book
Good product.
It's exactly as described.... It's a very simple laptop. I thought chromebook fold and can be turned into a tablet. It works and was new in the box. When trying to "setup up" start the computer It was loading for over 8 hours, I just turned it off and then turned it back on. It seemed like everything half loaded and wasn't loading right. My son can use it though for school so that's all that matters.
It's awesome
ok, i actually bought this off of groupon. Which i actually do not recommend you buy from.<br/><br/>This Chromebook is not flashy at all, but lets be honest, who is going to be buying a Chromebook to be flashy?..<br/><br/>It does what you expect it to do on a browser based laptop, you need to search the web? open it up and you have the web at your fingertips within seconds, the keyboard in my honest opinion is great, the track pad, well not good at all, i opted to get a mouse, so no biggie. Battery life is great, lasts me about 8 hours, usually doing my web based homework on line, speakers are surprisingly great for the price, no it wont be the best but again, for the price you cant complain.<br/><br/>now lets talk about the display.. again not the best display, but good enough for web usage. so basically this is for the people who just need to be checking facebook or go shopping online, things along that line, you will not be able to upgrade it in any way shape or form. No downloading applications, the only way to upgrade the storage is by using a memory card, and when you do that, it sticks out and you will need the adapter to put it in, i actually typed this with the laptop.
My only negative so far is that I really miss the camera that I have on the touch pad.  I do feel that this device is well worth the investment.The Acer Chromebook is lightweight, loads fast and has a high up time.  I have used it for hours without having to recharge or plug-in as opposed to my laptop and pad.  I don't feel you can go wrong with this device.
works great
Works great
You get what you pay for. It's slow, it's temperamental, and the OS doesn't do a quarter of what a PC can do. I wish I had bought something else. It's a Facebook machine and not much else. Very glad I only bought it to supplement my studies and that I have a better laptop. I would have sent this back and purchased something else if it was my only laptop.
The idea of the computer is great, however we have had this computer for less than 2 months and it cannot be used now unless it is plugged in. This is not a good thing for a laptop. I wanted to exchange it for one that would work, however you only have 30 days to do that. I'm not happy with that policy, which should be 90 days on an item like this.
For the price you cant beat it.
Good value
I love it.
Love it!!!
best thing since sliced bread!
Can't say enough about how my expectations were exceeded by this laptop.  This is the 2nd I've bought of this model and for the price you can't beat it.  Buy into the Google experience and this is as flawless & smooth an experience as you can get in this price range.  Do your friends and family a favor and recommend it.
When it arrive, the screen never came on, like it was not connected.  But tried the HDMI, and that worked.  Typing this review on it.  So, using it like a Chromebox, but not able to use it for the reason I purchased it.  (One cool thing--with the screen never coming on, the battery life is tremendous.)
fantastic
exelente
Love it!
nice one
perfect
Love it
I really like my Chromebook. I wasn't real happy with it, when I first received it. It was sent in some sort of factory test mode. I had to reinstall the Chrome operating system for it to work properly. It was inconvenient, but once I got it working, I have been very pleased.
Great!
i have the older model from a few years ago, the speakers were lousy, very low volume, this looks like a great deal ...does anyone know how the sound is on this one?
Great
Beware! This laptop was refurbished!
Nice
slow
Super light and fast.  Fills spot of a tablet but is smaller than a laptop.  I love this thing, my kids love it, the whole family loves it.  I never thought I would be interested in having a chromebook.<br/><br/>The only thing I don't like is it doesn't have Windows so you can't run Windows programs such as Microsoft Office.  If it did, this might take over my laptop completely.  It is so easy to use.  I have a feeling I'll be using it more when I get used to using Google Docs.  My kids already use Google Docs for school and they use it for that purpose.<br/><br/>It's cheaper than an iPad (and I still love my iPad), but the functionality is just about the same.  I have to admit, it is faster than the iPad.  It makes me want to order a keyboard for my iPad because I love the keyboard.  If you're looking for a cheap, fast, replacement for a tablet or a laptop, this is it.
I love it!
Initially, I was pleased when I opened the box and saw my new smart looking Acer Chromebook.  Sadly, beauty was only skin deep.  I<br/>charged the battery, and eagerly looked forward to my first free moments of the day to try out my new purchase.  Disappointingly, when I turned<br/>on the Chromebook, only a message appeared saying, "Chrome OS is missing or damaged," so didn't get to do anything.<br/><br/>I got on-line and found out I'd have to "recover" the Chromebook, but decided to pack it up and send it back.  I paid for something that<br/>worked, not something that needs to be worked on to make it usable.  My son has a Samsung Chromebook which has never given him problems.  He has<br/>even dropped it a couple of times and it has held up beautifully.  If I decide to buy another device, it won't be Acer.
Just got this set up a few hours ago.<br/><br/>Id like to say a sarcastic thank you to the people who answered my question "Can this play 60fps video smoothly?" with the reply "yes". Because no, this laptop cannot play 60fps video smoothly at all. It can play 1080p video just fine, but most video over 720p is 60fps now, and they frameskip alot.<br/><br/>Other than that, it works just fine for everything else, though google chrome eats up a bit over half the laptops RAM when you are using it with 1 tab.<br/><br/>I regret going for a cheaper 2gb ram/32gb storage chromebook, i should have bought the HP 11, which i know can play 60fps video and doesnt eat half the ram card when looking at facebook.
I had to send this back because the space bar wouldn't work properly. I had to hit the space bar either really hard or repeatedly to get it to work. I'm not sure if it was a defect or if it's just how it normally is, but regardless, I didn't want a replacement for it.
yes
i love this chromebook, however, how can i have it running in windows?
great light weight computer perfect for games! loving the chromebook!
I love my Acer Chromebook. Quicker than my desktop on the internet.
Nearly all tablets are better than this and some are even cheaper
this is a gift for my granddaughter for xmas, she is can't wait to have her own computer, this one will be great for a starter, and I am sure she will enjoy it.
great
It's terrible on connecting to the Internet, and you can't ever plug Internet cable when you really need one and cannot wait for the notebook to decide to work. An internet-based computer that does not connect to the Internet is a wast of money, time and is a great test for patience. Don't blame my Internet provider or WiFi router, because other notebooks work just fine.
Arrived as expected. Giving as a Christmas gift.
The laptop is actually a Christmas gift......
Received as described and fast shipping!
Like it.  For the price, can't beat it!
Got it in 2 days and itwouldnt turn on
I brought this as a gift for my friend and it showed up cracked and broken!
in love with my new labby work perfectly great to using it as we speak
its a chromebook yet chrome apps does not work on it how disgusting
great little computer -fast
Granddaughter  LOVES  it.
It's great - we love it.
Its great for browsing !
I can  not find the total 16 G local hard drive. The storage of the local download folder only has less than 1 G storage. I will return this product.
Well, based on all the great reviews I decided to buy this for my daughter's birthday.  She was so excited, we plugged it in and an error message came up saying that "Chrome OS was missing or damaged. I called Amazon right away and they said they would refund me and send me another one from a different company. That came today, only 2 days later.  I plugged it in and got through the first three steps and now it's been "determining device configuration" for a half hour.  I don't know what to do and I'm frustrated.
so happy with it.
Great, Love it!!
Son loves it.
I'm returning the laptop. The print was too small & I didn't like the keyboard, but it was fast so for some people it might be ok.
HORRIBLE!!!MESSED UP SCREEN EVERY TIME I BOUGHT IT
Computer died in a little over 6 months (apparently this is a very common problem... do a google search).  Troubleshooting with customer service now.  Thankfully it is still under warranty, but now I must pay for shipping to have it repaired.  What would have happened if this occurred after the 1 year warranty was over?  A $200 computer that lasts barely over a year is a very expensive computer.  My expectations were for this to last at least 3 years (compared to my old apples that lasted 7 years each).
I refused to under rate this machine even though I sent it back. People make sure you understand that the Operating System - O.S. Chrome is not for everyone so do your research! Lightening quick machine with limitations I get the idea but just wasn't working for me.
Love it!
Love it!
I already own one with a 320GB local HD.and quite happy with it. However, my question for the new model:<br/><br/>IS THAT POSSIBLE TO REPLACE THE 16GB FLASH STORAGE  WITH A 128GB ONE?.
We didn't realize that we could only use the chrome browser for everything. Sometimes online applications require Firefox or other browsers. Aside from that it's great!
This computer is adequate for the price. I didn't expect the casing to be plastic. It is really cheap. If you want something that connect to the Internet and allows some work using the office program installed through Google, it is adequate, but I would not purchase this item again. In fact, I will be looking for something else soon.
Doesn't connect to the WiFi. This chromebook, or chromebooks in general have a problem connecting to certain kinds of WIFi. I have had no issues connecting to the same WiFi source using several different phones and Laptops. It's a chromebook issue and it renders this purchase useless for me.
I loved it. Its a great little computer. Its the mighty mouse of tech world for the price and capabilities.
Nice
This is the worst investment we have ever made. It locked up after 3 uses and even though we purchased extra protection no one would help us or make this right. Wanted to give it 0 stars but couldn't.
Do not buy a chromebook.  All it does is surf the internet.  My files disappear  The sound is terrible.  Scrolling is terrible. For a long time it insisted that I was in Guatemala and would not change to English.  I guess Google finally spied on me enough, figured my address, and took it upon themselves to change it for me.  It was a waste of money.
The charger they sent me doesn't even work... I can't even turn on my laptop
This looked like a great deal at first. The reviews were good and we went ahead and purchased it for our daughter who mostly needs it for streaming Netflix. For a day or so, it looked to be the perfect fit. However, we were quickly disappointed when it suddenly started losing wireless connectivity every few minutes. The wireless connectivity display indicated that the device was connected, but I could not get to the web or stream video. I attempted to find some help online, but no one seemed to have any fixes that worked. There was a lot of "never seen this before" and "return it - I'm stumped" answers.<br/>I'm a computer scientist so naturally I attempted to look under the hood a little bit - to no avail. Nothing I tried kept the chromebook from losing its connectivity to the wireless network. Other devices showed no issues - so I know it isn't my wireless network.<br/>When the chromebook did have connectivity, the signal showed up as being very weak (perhaps 50%), even when it was next to the router. I discovered online that several other chromebooks have had this issue. I'm amazed that this chromebook has so many good reviews when the wireless connectivity is so unreliable. Either the reviews are fake or I just got a lemon. I have some crappy hardware before, but seriously - one day of use and the thing starts to fail? Not very impressed - to say the least. I'll be returning mine for a full refund.
This laptop is whack. A tablet does the same for way cheaper.it doesn't download anything but crap apps
Could not connect to a printer, my flash drives were not compatible, it was a pain to use.
OK for the price, but cheaply made and the chrome browser is impossible to block annoying, repetitive pop-up tabs.  I'll pay the extra $$$ next time and go back to MAC!
the laptop screen will not turn on and it is cracked and shipped later than advertised.
Perfect for our needs!
10/10 would recommend
Dead on arrival. Returned.
It would have earned a lot more than one star had the screen lasted more than one month. The damage may have started by my picking up the chromebook with my thumb in contact with the screen, but it's hard to tell for sure. The function of the chromebook itself and the keyboard seem fine at this point, but the non-functional portion of the screen has progressed from a thumb sized area on the upper left portion of the screen to fully half of the screen in two days. The price would have been fine had it lasted at least a few years. But, one month? No way!
Excellent all around!
This heaping pile of trash died on me the first week I got it.
I beg you not to buy this sweet looking little machine.  I loved it so much at first.  But looks are deceiving.  I bought another one after the first failed.  It starts with a black image on the screen quite large. the second one failed the same way even though I handled it gently.  I've read reviews after the second one failed and apparently there's some defect in the manufacturing of this machine.  Please don't waste your time and/or money.
I've had the C720 since November 2013 and it still works perfectly. it was my sons & I took it over, so,I bought him this newer one a year later, i am waiting on the 2nd replacement ,BECAUSE ,his microphone keeps going out, muting itself or breaking?  He doesn't yell OK GOOGLE, so I don't understand. Maybe someone can tell me whats going on? it is not muted  (yet doesn't work) on google hang out ,so the microphone is broken. Has anyone else had this type of problem? I must say Amazon has been great about exchanging it no problems at all, and if this happens to the new one i will get a refund and get the C720. (or the acer 13 inch we have that one as well) If not for this issue It would receive 5 stars.<br/>It is fast ,light ,& the battery life is fantastic!! I've never has any issues connecting to internet or it holding a charge. as far as looks we bought a shell and its now a Red chromebook that all my sons friends end up using instead of their notebooks when over..The backspace key and power key are WAY too close together and ive accidently turned off my work a few times,also on this model the power cord inserts in the back of the machine, something Ive had on an acer LapTop that ended up breaking the charger.it would be fantastic if it had a forward (or is it rear? on the lid) facing camera, however we have made it work and taken home pictures all the time. I know this isnt a professional review, I didn't write anything down first for that I apologize. I need to set this back to factory now, as the new one is going to be here today. however, I'll be checking back if anyone has answers to the microphone issue, it does NOT appear t be a known "issue" like everyone who has any problem says theirs is..lol. Thank You.
great
It broke after 2 weeks with a white screen
Don't like Chromebook, sorry Google.
So when I first say the specs for this machine I thought it was too good to be true. Touch screen, 360 degree hinges, 1 terabyte of could storage space, plus to top it off I could get it in BLUE but then I read the reviews all saying it was a good computer so I purchased it.<br/><br/>Turns out the old saying was true  if its sounds too good to be true it usually is. It was excruciatingly slow. I only need a computer for two things. Doing school work and watching porn so I figured this would be enough. I was wrong. I would just have firefox open and it would start freezing up just from normal web browsing.  It would restart itself a few times. It couldn't handle any of the tasks I did except for word processing without locking up momentarily.<br/><br/>I figured it would be slow but that I could just upgrade the memory but turns out this computer is not upgradable so I promptly returned the SOB.
I hate it, just couldn't use it for online classes and most of the review
Not the best on the market. It's not compatible with windows or internet explorer
threw in the trash not user friendly does not play well with others! Like downloading photos it traps you and will not allow you to use anything but what they want. hate it!
blessing
Wasn't what I wanted at all. Its just a glorified cell phone.
I returned it.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON  THIS! This isn't the worst peice of junk, but the touch screen doesn't work anymore and i've only had it for about a month. Its super slow and is falling apart. If your looking for a good quality chromebook, get the one by Dell. I'm not trying to advertise for them, but i got that one once i had enough with this Chromebook, and i'm much happier, though I wasn't able to get my money back.
I was confused, I thought this was a computer. Hopefully I figure it out. There's nothing on it.
