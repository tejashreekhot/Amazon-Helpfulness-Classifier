OK so after having this phone for 11 days now I figured I should get around to making an honest review. To give some context I currently have a Samsung Galaxy S4, my wife has a Nexus 5, my older daughter has an IPhone, and my younger daughter has a Blu Studio 5.0 II (love that phone) I had been researching this phone since it was announced. So I was very excited to get it 2 days after ordering it via Amazon prime for only $218 shipped. When I got the phone I was a little scared because I could not get it to turn on right away as almost all other phones had been able to do out of the box. So I threw it on the charger for an hour and viola it boots right up... Just a dead battery, no big deal. (This may be what was wrong for others who gave this phone a bad review)<br/><br/>So onto the phone, WOW, what a display! It is amazing... Very bright and the colors seem spot on to me. It is definitely brighter than the super AMOLED screen on the Samsung Galaxy S4. At the time KitKat was not yet available so after booting up I had to install the update to get the Google services to work. No big deal again... Took less than 10 minutes. Now that the KitKat OS update is available (yay!) This may be a moot point. Speaking of KitKat it became available a few days later. That install went very smooth... A small side note a SD card is required to install KitKat.<br/>I would assume everyone who buys this phone will increase the factory 4 gig storage with a new SD card anyway.<br/><br/>Kitkat seems very, very good on this phone without any bugs *see update at end of review* that I have seen unlike when I upgraded to KitKat on my Galaxy S4... I had a problem with my phone not wanting to wake up, hense my looking for a new phone.<br/><br/>I love the near-stock Android experience that Blu puts on their phone. It's not all stuffed with bloat like Samsung's Touch Wiz.<br/><br/>It's been a year and a half and I am still paying over $100 a month for my subsidised Galaxy S4 with 4 gigs of data a month through At&t.; I can't wait until my contract is up with them... I will never do a subsidised contract phone again. This $218 phone with a prepaid service like Straight Talk at $45 a month is unbeatable.<br/><br/>I was able to take the At&t; micro Sim card from the S4 and with the help of an adapter kit from Amazon put it in the Blu 6.0 HD<br/>(KAISI 4 in 1 Sim Card Converter Adapter Kit $4.15)<br/><br/>The phone set itself up to work automatically on At&t.; I did not have to set or change any of the APN settings.<br/><br/>Calls are about average, no complaints.<br/><br/>The touch screen is not a sensitive as my S4 but only very slightly less. 11 days later I really don't notice any sensitivity issues.<br/><br/>The phone is very responsive with very little lag. YouTube and Netflix videos play well on both WiFi and the HDSPA 21 mb data network. I notice a few more seconds of buffering for videos over my S4 on the 4g LTE network but nothing worth worrying about. I did notice sometimes the audio would get a touch out of sync with video on the YouTube app but a quick backup of a few seconds on the scroll bar fixed that when it was a problem. (Update 7/26/14 This appears fixed with the latest OTA update)  Otherwise video is superb on this phone as are pictures. I don't see much of a need for these super hi definition phones.  The 720 x 1280 245 PPI on the Blu 6.0 is just fine for my eyes.<br/><br/>The speaker is about average for a general smart phone... Just fine for videos and music.<br/><br/>The headphone jack works well with all the headphones and ear buds I have tried with it.<br/><br/>The camera is surprisingly good of course not a good as the Samsung S4 or IPhone but does great for what I need. The front camera isn't too bad either. I will try to get some comparison photos taken with the Blue 6.0, the Galaxy S4 and the Nexus 5. Look for those on the Amazon owner-submitted pictures.<br/><br/>The 3000 mAH battery is pretty darn good. Getting me through most of my day. I may have to throw it on the charger towards end of the night as I use it constantly throughout the day. (my 10.1" tablet gets used a lot less now that I have this phablet)<br/><br/>The USB charging socket at the top of the device take a little getting used-to but I am fine with it now.<br/>As far as GPS goes it does work.... BUT I did notice that the GPS sometimes had me appear as if I was not properly centered on the road at all time... not sure what that was about but it was putting me off by maybe 50 to a hundred feet or so but would correct itself... I was able to successfully navigate all three of times I used the GPS.... Once with no problems and the other 2 times it showed my truck driving "next" to the road sometimes. Hopefully Blu will fix this issue with an update.<br/>(Update 7/26/14 this appears to be fixed with the latest OTA update... Much better now)<br/>As far a size goes it is big but I am still able to fit it in my front pocket no problem. I was able to fix my Galaxy S4 from not being able to boot up with a reset but I still find myself using the Blu 6.0 HD over the S4 because of the big beautiful screen. Sorry Samsung the S4 seems to be collecting a lot of dust lately.<br/><br/>The con's I see for this phone are lack of cases and availability of hardened "gorilla" type glass protectors. (The supplied case works great btw.) Also I miss the TV remote capability of the S4 and the wireless Qi charging of the Nexus 5 but for only $218 shipped via Amazon Prime this unlocked phone can't be beat. I give it 5 stars. Samsung and Apple can keep all their gimmicky smart scrolls and finger print scanners... This phone does 99% of what I need it to do and at cost less than 1/3 of the other flagships. Buy one... You won't be disappointed!<br/><br/>*Update July 27 2014*<br/>Blu released an update to the KitKat release that fixed a few issues that popped up. Some I found are as follows:<br/>Stock Android messaging app Hangouts would fail and crash when sending a text. This is now fixed. I had heard it also could not send pics via text on WiFi... This is now fixed too.<br/><br/>I heart radio would crash upon opening. This is now fixed.<br/><br/>The stock YouTube app would freeze and audio would get out of sync on both data and WiFi. This seems better now. I do most of my You Tube watching through the chrome browser. Perfect.<br/><br/>The GPS had issues showing accurate location. This Noe seems better. GPS works pretty well now.<br/><br/>Any other findings I will post here.<br/><br/>If anyone knows of a Blu Studio 6.0 HD forum maybe you can post it here in the comments section.
This is a fantastic solid phone.  Like any good customer of my service provider (stupid me) I went into my local phone store and asked for a "chip swap" from micro to a full size sim.  First the rep looked at me like I was from Mars for NOT buying the phone from them, said he couldn't guarantee it work on their network.  I offered my assurances, based on my research, but thought his head was going to explode when he realized it was a dual sim phone.<br/><br/>Once they swapped out the chip and scanned the IMEI code for the phone I was out the door.  Voice and TXT worked perfectly so I assumed data was working as well.  As another reviewer clearly pointed out 3G HSPA+ (4G) like speeds from the same network I use.  Only when I got back to work did I realize WIFI worked, but wireless data did not.<br/><br/>Trusting this had something to do with the "update" everyone else mentioned in their reviews, I promptly connected via WIFI, downloaded the update and STILL didn't have wireless data access. I even created a new a APN for it but nothing worked.<br/><br/>By the end of day I felt so completely frustrated I filed an Amazon return, then returned to the providers store and had them re-enable my old phone with another micro sim and everything worked....No muss, no fuss.  Like the rep would want to help me get the phone working anyway.<br/><br/>Next morning I'm at my desk at home and suddenly remember I had a micro-to-full size sim converter somewhere in my office.  After locating the little plastic jewel, I put the sim back into my Blu Studio phone and powered it up....IT WORKED! EVERYTHING WORKED!  I removed the refund request and put my 64GB micro SD in.<br/><br/>I'm typically not the paranoid "big brother" type, but here's what I've discovered.  IF YOUR WIRELESS CARRIER SCANS THE IMEI code for the phone they automatically know you have an "off contract phone" that has the ability to do things they would typically like you to pay for...Say turning your phone into a wireless access point for free?<br/><br/>So to conclude this review my friend our lesson here is this...If you have a micro sim card BUY a converter kit!  DO NOT take the phone to your wireless provider and do a sim swap.  My phone now runs 3G HSPA+ no problem, and I have the ability to run a business and personal number from the same fantastic phone.  THANK YOU BLU!<br/><br/>Oh and if you want a really good UI experience with this device I recommend downloading and installing MIUI Lite-2.0.0.apk or a later rev.  The phone looks great and now has an equally cool looking UI.
FIRST IMPRESSIONS<br/>ok, i've read all the reviews as well as researched this phone on youtube.  i must say, this is a very good phone.  it doesn't come loaded with bloatware, it's very simplistic, and it's only $226.  this is phone is a bargain.  i've compared this to lg g3, lg pro 2, galaxy mega, galaxy note 3, and the huawei ascend mate2.  asides from the huawei ascend mate2, this phone cost half or less than half of the brand name phablets (the huawei cost $300 btw - also a very good phone).  now, of course, this phone is no where as nearly as powerful or sharp (graphics wise) as the brand name phones i've mentioned.  but, those phones cost $400-$700 and comes loaded with bloatware.  plus, unless you play a lot of graphics intense games, you really don't need a phone with pixels above 720 x 1280 - which is what this phone is, btw.<br/><br/>1 STAR REVIEWS AND ISSUES<br/>Now, as to those unfavorable reviews regarding the phone's inability to access the google playstore, i did not experience that issue.  BLU must have did a software update. i did not experience any issues with the phone whatsoever.  however, the phone doesn't run the latest version of android out the box.  it comes as android 4.2.2 (or jellybean).  This can be easily remedied by doing a software update. go to 'settings' > 'about device' > 'wireless update'.  you will notice a difference, as the phone does run smoother with the latest version of android 4.4.2 (android kit kat).<br/><br/>PROCESSING SPEED AND GRAPHICS ARE SIMILAR TO...<br/>if i had to compare this to another phone, i would say it's kind of like the galaxy note 2.  i have a galaxy note 2 and it runs about the same, graphics wise and speed wise.  of course this phone has a .5 inch bigger display, comes factory unlocked, doesn't have all the pre-installed samsung bloatware, and it doesn't have a stylus.  Personally, im glad it doesn't come with a stylus, i never use it.<br/><br/>WHAT'S IN THE BOX?<br/>case, headphones, cable, plug, phone.  check this out this unboxing on youtube<br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nDzFkTP4b0<br/><br/>4G OR 4G LTE<br/>this phone runs off hsdpa+, so it's not true lte.  it's more like 3.5G and up.  but. depending on where you are, hsdpa+ can run 4g speeds comparable to lte.  so yes, this phone is '4g-ish' but not lte.<br/><br/>SPECS<br/>this is a Quad-core phone.  it runs off 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7.  graphics: 720 x 1280 pixels, 6.0 inches (~245 ppi pixel density)<br/>memory: 4 GB ROM, 1 GB RAM.  it is bluetooth enabled and can pick up fm radio stations as well.<br/>go to gsmarena.com for the full specs. here's the link. http://www.gsmarena.com/blu_studio_6_0_hd-6330.php<br/>gsmarena doesn't list 4g on the spec sheet but it is 4g capable.<br/><br/>OVERALL<br/>i got this because 1) price, 2) factory unlocked, 3) bloatware free (i have OCD when it comes to clutter, including digital clutter), 4) 6" screen size, 5) simplistic, 6) i wanted to take a chance on a smaller company vs the samsung's and apple.  now, this phoine may not be for you if you're looking for something powerful and sophisticated.  it doesn't come with a heart rate monitor, fingerprint reader, ir beam, etc.  this won't be the best phone to run the latest intense games, videos, or apps.  but, if you're like me, and you just need a good large screen phone to: run emails, facebook, twitter, instagram, music, or even to read while on the treadmill, then this phone will do just fine.<br/><br/>ALTERNATE PHONE<br/>do check out the huawei ascend mate2 as well.  it's a little pricier ($300), but it's a good phone as well.
Since others have done such a wonderful job going into technical specifications and responding to many questions, I'm just going to throw my immediate thoughts in:<br/><br/>There are definitely some caveats to this phone, some of which I'll detail below:<br/>The case included is the only one I've found that fits it, but even this one isn't perfect. The cutouts for the headphones and charging dock are not large enough; I have to take the case off at night to charge*. The speaker cutout is not in line with the speaker itself and the button covers are not hollowed out inside, so the buttons become very sensitive to the touch. Overall, I think more time was spent going for design with this case versus functionality. It's a nice looking case, but it's far too smooth on the back to provide any decent grip. That being said, I've dropped the phone twice and both times it took the (short) falls in stride.<br/><br/>The screen bounces between being too responsive and not responsive enough. Part of this, I believe but have yet to test, is the included screen cover. It's nothing special in the least, application was a pain as always and bubbles around the edge are impossible to get out. Nothing new there, but since I have yet to find a premium cover that is fitted to the Blu, I'm just ignoring the bubbles. The buttons on the front of the phone are also too/not responsive.<br/><br/>The camera (8mp) works fine for my uses, but can be a bit slow to focus in and commit to the actual picture taking. With a steady hand, pictures and videos turn out great. I recommend enabling the volume rocker to be used for the camera button, as the on-screen button (based on my too/not responsive issues) takes too many screen taps to finally hit for me. The front-facing camera is nothing new and fancy at all, but it does give you the ability to take selfies and video chat with others, so it's just fine for me.<br/><br/>Despite having very large hands, I still find myself having issues with managing to hold the phone without it feeling awkward. That being said, if you don't mind committing to finding that "sweet spot", or feel comfortable using two hands on your phone, this shouldn't be an issue. Watching movies on the huge screen is a treat when I don't have my tablet with me to stare at. I recommend trying to hold a Samsung Galaxy Note in your hands first, as this is slightly larger. If you're comfortable with it, chances are you'll adjust fine to the size of this phablet.<br/><br/>Bluetooth is a joy and a pain. It does work, but has frozen my device before. The range is ridiculously minuscule, in my experience. With other devices, I've managed a solid 15-25 feet through two walls and still been connected to my speaker. This phone gives me about 5-10, no walls at all. I do wish more time had been spent improving this, and for some people this may be a hangup. For me, it's more or less something I've learned to live with.<br/><br/>Speakerphone is worthless. No one can ever hear me on the other end when I have the speakerphone on. In the event I need to use it, I connect to my bluetooth speaker (which has a mic embedded) and carry out the conversation. This really is a big issue for me, and I'd imagine quite a few people. I almost returned the phone when I found this out. Just before I was ready to ship it out, I decided I'd deal, as finding this phone was hard enough. If I could go back, I'd definitely get it exchanged to make sure it's not a defect with just my phone. But I'm outside of that time zone now, so I'm back to just dealing with it.<br/><br/>The speaker itself is in a horrible spot, but I knew this before I purchased. It's "loud-ish". There's a definite tinny quality to the sound, but I so rarely use the actual speaker that when I do, I simply cup my hand around the speaker to redirect the sound. Not ideal, but it's not in my top 10 for worst features.<br/><br/>Visual voicemail doesn't work for most services out the box. Some offer their own branded app. My service provider did not, but I remedied this with the freely available Youmail app. Seeing as how this isn't the phone's fault, I didn't include this in my rating calculation, but this could be an issue for some people, so I'm throwing it in for anyone who may be interested.<br/><br/>Although this is not the phone's fault, I take issue with Kitkat. It came pre-installed, which is what I wanted and had hoped for, but there are things about the OS that irk me on a daily basis. I note a small compatibility issue between the phone and Kitkat, but it does function 99% of the time. Again, just my personal experience, but for 95% of users this shouldn't be an issue.<br/><br/>A few features I enjoy:<br/>Dedicated buttons! One of my major gripes with other phones are the lack of dedicated buttons. Although these are touch-screen buttons, they still respond better than any on-screen button phones I've used. Another plus here is the screen real estate when viewing movies or playing games.<br/><br/>Speaking of games, let me just say how refreshing it is to game on my phone again! I used to play constantly, but my Samsung Galaxy S4 just wasn't up to par with graphics. Asphalt 8 is my current obsession - and yes, the graphics are set to max! I definitely recommend trying it out to really stress test your new phone's graphics processor. I do notice a slight heating, but this is normal with any phone battery.<br/><br/>The battery! My God the battery on this phone is fantastic! With low use, I managed almost a full 72 hours from full battery to dead. Usually I get an average of 36 hours with moderate usage and even on heavy usage it lasts me from the time I wake up until I pass out watching Netflix on it. My only bad note on the battery is that it's not removable. I knew this before purchasing, so I was aware of what I was getting into. That being said, if the phone gets hung up, you basically just wait until it resets itself (typically 1-3 minutes from the point of freezing). I'm sure there's a way to force a hard reset using the power and volume rocker, but I haven't found the right combination the two times it's frozen up on me. Again, my experience, but I was stress testing when it happened so it's really a non-issue.<br/><br/>In my stress testing, I've had game after browser after Tumblr after (insert app name here)... the multi-tasking capabilities are amazing! I typically install a "sweeper" program to tidy things up and free up memory every once in a while. After installing it, I was getting constant messages about the RAM being at 90+%, but the device never faltered. I truly believe it was just an issue with the sweeper, so I just uninstalled it and manually close things once or twice daily just to help keep my phone solid. I've never had an issue with having too many apps open while testing, so I can only imagine a regular user would be ecstatic over the way it performs!<br/><br/>The charger is pretty standard, but of nice build quality. It looks and feels like the chargers included with premium phones, not the cheap $0.99 charger and cords you find on eBay, if that makes any difference to you. The headphones included have a mic on the line-in and are of midgrade quality. For included headphones, they're awesome! The rubber earbud replacements are nice, three sizes to pick from. It may sound weird, but the box the phone comes in is really cool all on its own. It reminds me of an iPhone box, when looking at the quality. If you're giving this as a gift, it's definitely dressed for first impressions!<br/><br/>Do I recommend this phone?<br/>To some, yes. I've gone over my issues with the phone, given some insight into a feature or two and all along the way tried to justify what I was saying so people who are less technical can understand what they're purchasing. If this is your first venture into the phablet market, I might recommend something a bit more along the lines of the Blu 5. If you are comfortable with the size and few issues that come along with it, by all means snatch this up!<br/><br/>For those who are dropping their contracts in favor of cheaper service (or transferring from other prepaid programs), I really recommend you do your research on the phone services you're interested in using with this phone. Keep in mind this is a GSM phone - not CDMA. Please know that the description of this ad may be misleading. I ordered this with the intent of using it with Cricket Wireless, as they had the best rate and coverage for my area and were listed in the description. After two SIM card issues, I went to their store. As soon as the employee saw the brand name, they sighed. The ad shows you an example of the possible GSM-based networks you can sign up with - this does NOT mean that the phone is compatible with them all. If in doubt, contact your preferred service provider and ask them if they are compatible with this phone (or any you decide on). Also ask them if they provide the APN settings! Some SIM cards include the settings (such as Simple Mobile, whom I ended up going with and recommend!) but others require manual entry. Cricket required manual entry of the settings, but it still would not work with this phone. Thankfully I had multiple options for carriers - I highly recommend you do the same!<br/><br/>Do I feel it's worth the cost?<br/>Despite the issues I've encountered, I feel I'm holding a phone worthy of the price tag. My phones last at least a year, and in most cases almost 2. With the price of this phone, I've saved tons by going back to prepaid and still enjoy the same service. I'd say it's worth it.<br/><br/>★★★★☆ - Size<br/>★★★★★ - Durability<br/>★★★★★ - Appearance<br/>★★★☆☆ - Speaker Quality<br/>★★★★★ - Battery<br/>★★★☆☆ - Accessories
Let me add my five stars to the others who have been fortunate enough to purchase this phone.  This is my fourth smart phone ever.  I started with a Blackberry about eight to 10 years ago and kept it for a month before giving it to my son.  That turned me off smart phones so much I didn't bother to purchase another until about four years ago when I purchased my second.  That lasted about six months and I purchased a Samsung Nexus 4 shortly after they were released.  That was a lovely phone and works to this day.  However, it's a little slow.  It can't be upgraded past Jelly Bean and I've wanted a larger phone.  So, after looking for a larger phone for quite some time and never able to make a decision I happened on a review of a different Blu phone and started exploring.<br/><br/>Within two hours I had ordered my Studio 6.  I just received it yesterday (thank you Amazon for $3.99 overnight!).  Purchased a 32gb SD card last night and today it's up and running.  I will extend this later after I have more experience but I wanted to give my first impressions:<br/><br/>1.  I can confirm what many other reviewers have said; the build quality is second to none.  It feels good in your hand but isn't exceptionally heavy.  In fact, I can't tell much difference in weight between my much smaller Nexus 4 and the Blu.<br/><br/>2.  It is big.  However, it's not that big.  I also have a Nexus 7 tablet and the Blu 6 is no where near as big.  I wear shorts most of the time and it fits nicely in a front pocket.<br/><br/>3.  The sound is significantly better than my Nexus 4.  A problem I've had in the past is not hearing my phone ring when I'm in a store, etc.  Part of that is getting older but part of the problem was the phone.  I don't think that's going to be a problem anymore!<br/><br/>4.  The screen is crisp and clear.  The swipe and touch response is immediate.  Apps display very quickly.  Again, I'm comparing this to my old Nexus 4.  I just don't believe that a $800 Samsung is that much better.  I don't play games nor watch movies on my phone.  But I do read a lot.  The screen is just perfect for that.<br/><br/>5.  I use Net10 (if you haven't tried them yet, please do).  So, I took the SIM card from my Nexus and put it into the Blu.  Worked like a champ.  No problems at all.  One thing; you may not find instructions on how to remove the back of the phone so that you can insert the SD card and the SIM.  It's very easy.  If you look at the bottom corner of the phone (either side) you'll easily see the separation between the back and the rest of the phone.  Just insert your finger nail (or something similarly thin) in that separation and pull the back off.  It should come off easily.  It is attached in a bunch of places along the edge but those separate easily and go back together easily.  You'll be surprised at how simple it is.  Maybe that's why there aren't any instructions?<br/><br/>6.  VERY IMPORTANT!!!  I bought this phone so that I could give my wife my old Nexus 4.  For the last several years she's been running an old Tracfone flip-phone and the battery, which was never very good, has basically given out.  Plus, trying to text from the old phone, etc is almost impossible.  When I got the Blu 6 and saw how fast it was I figured I'd buy her a Blu 5 or something similar instead.  However, when she saw my Blu 6 she loved it.  Most importantly, she didn't think it was too big.  Fits nicely in one of the flaps on the outside of her purse.  So, for less than one Samsung Note III or something similar I will have two Blu 6s and my wife will be happy too!  What more could you ask for?<br/><br/>7.  I do have to say, I had no problem connecting to Google Play and my GMail account even before I upgraded to KitKat.  This entire setup has been so smooth.  Everything updated quickly and properly.  Why can't M$ figure this out?<br/><br/>I will update this review in the next couple of weeks.  However, given what others have found I don't expect to have anything but good experiences.  I hope this helps you make your decision.  If you purchase one and enjoy it as much as I have please write your own review.  I believe it's important to have good competitors to the big guys and Blu, so far, is certainly worthy of being one of those competitors!<br/><br/>For those who are wondering I have no connection to the company at all.  Further, I purchased my phone.  I don't write reviews for a living, I write software.  So, you shouldn't be surprised if this review isn't as professional as you would like! :)
I like my cellphone
Got it and unpacked it. Was terribly excited as it is a Walmart best seller and currently now out of stock.<br/>Black and glossy and slick. Everything came as promised.<br/>FYI<br/>First pause...no mini sim slot like my BLU Life 8 or my BLU Studio 5.5 S<br/>Second pause...has a fixed battery.  No mention of that in the writeup...wonder why?<br/><br/>Tried to power it on and nothing.  I remember reading a review prior where the phone came with discharged battery.<br/>Plugged in the cable, no lights come on. waited an hour, nothing. Tried another charger, waited another hour, still nothing.<br/>Unplugged the device and tried to turn it on, yet nothing.<br/>So I plugged it in again and started to prepare to return it, as it seemed faulty.<br/>Decided to write a review but got distracted for about 2 hours or so.<br/>Feeling a bit dejected, especially as they are out of stock..  Back to my Studio 5.5S<br/>Decided to unplug the thing and re-box it, in the process I pressed the power button one last time.<br/>It lit up :D charging 12%.<br/>I turned it back off and will wait until it is fully charged to setup and make an informed review.<br/>I'm pleased again.<br/>Look for the update in two weeks :)<br/>April 30, 2015 (not quite two weeks) but see update below:<br/>Been using the unit and the battery reading was glitchy form the start.<br/>Would be at 3% and after charging for 15 mins would say fully charged 100%, yup...<br/>Anyway that didn't deter me. Phone froze three different times, still no worries.<br/>Then the charge started to last progressively less until I was only getting 2+ hours of battery life.<br/>On April 3 it died and wouldn't light up when I tried to charge it, tried different chargers, no luck.<br/>On April 4 I plugged it in and left it overnight. On April 5 I found the screen had cracked. Yes cracked.<br/>Further investigation revealed the battery had swollen. As it's fixed it didn't push off the cover, it went forward towards the screen.<br/>I quite enjoyed the phone before all this, the sleek build and great screen quality for the price.<br/>never liked the location of the earphone though, not at the top edge of the unit.
There as an issue with the software on first release where the google services/ google play were not working as described in the previous review. this has since been corrected by BLU and a software fix was sent via the wireless update feature. anyone who has this device should go to settings, about device, wireless update, and check for updates. the new software downloaded will fix this issue.
Iv'e had this phone for 3-4 months now, which I bought for $169 from a known chain retailer. Physically, the HD 6 is a beautiful phone, and it feels solid. No creaks, no bending, and it feels good in your hand even though it is a very large phone. Sadly these are the only pros about this phone and now I have to write about the many cons:<br/><br/>- Screen started to develop bright spots near the bottom and left lower corner. I've seen other cheaply made phones with the same problem, and I'm not talking about light bleed, but probably a problem with the adhesive used for the LCD (ASUS had the same issue with some of their tablets)<br/><br/>- Phone call quality is atrocious. Most of the time I have to press the phone firmly against my ear to be able to hear a thing. The volume is so low that it makes it impossible to have a conversation.<br/><br/>- Sound quality is equally horrible. I've tried several types of headphones/earphones, and the distortion is horrendous. If you need a phone to listen to music, look elswhere. I've tried PowerAmp and half a dozen other music apps to no avaiI, this is he worst sounding phone I have ever had. In comparison I have an LG L70, which is a super low-end phone and it packs quite a punch when compared to the HD 6.<br/><br/>-Camera is mediocre and most of the shots come out with lots of noise. Unless you're outdoors with plenty of sun you're not gonna get a decent shot. If you're trying to take closeup shots using macro or use a banking app to deposit checks, this is not the phone for you. Every single shot comes up blurred and it can never focus properly. The camera is completely useless with QR scanner apps, too so beware if you intend on using any of those<br/><br/>-Performance is so so. in terms of games, I've had nothing but crashes with most of the stuff I've tried, from Skyforce to Smash Hit, it constantly reboots itself. It chokes easily if you have a few apps open and more often than not there's a noticeable lag when opening certain apps.<br/><br/>I bought this phone after seeing the 4 star rating, but I should've researched a little better, cause most of the reviews concentrate on the screen size, etc and not on the actual performance of the phone. With all these problems, I can't recommend the Studio HD 6 to anyone, except those that want to flash some eye candy and are ok with its many shortcomings.
Great budget phone. You need to understand what you are buying with BLU. This is not a phone to do heavy gaming or even moderate multitasking. This is not a phone to have great speaker or responsive touchscreen. This is not a phone if you have any ambition to use it as a camera. What it is, is very budget friendly tweener phablet, as they call a combo phone/tablet. It has big bright screen with good resolution.<br/><br/>Display exhibits some heavy polarization and is not very responsive to touch. It's OK, but comparing to any modern smartphone, the display does take extra effort to navigate and some light touches are not recognized. The phone also is very long thanks to extended areas to the top and bottom of display. As the result, it won't fit into any regular pockets - protruding a good inch or two even in jeans.<br/><br/>The speaker is at the bottom rear and this is a typical position for cheap phones as it allows to use surface of the table as sound amplifier. But when you hold it in hand, sound comes out weak and muddy. It's good enough for some aggressive game soundtracks, but lacks clarity as a speakerphone or when watching movies.<br/><br/>WiFi is a b/g/n and I suspect dual band as this phone has some of the strongest WiFi antennas I have seen in phones or even tablets. My iPad Air has weaker antenna then this Blu. But the phone completely lacks 5GHz antenna, so any WiFi networks on that bandwidth are ignored.<br/><br/>Cellular modem has a very wide selection of frequencies that satisfy most 2G/3G GSM networks (AT&T; and T-Mobile in US and most of the operators outside Japan). 4G network frequencies are also present, but only for International market. So some of the high speed T-Mobile 4G networks that operate on 1700/2100 MHz are missing. T-Mobile based providers would still allow to provide speed in excess of 3G if you happen to be in territory where T-Mobile has HSPA+ bands.<br/><br/>Since the phone comes unlocked, it is very friendly to switch between any GSM-based provider. I use it with PTel, which has the cheapest Pay-As-You-Go plan in US (5cents per minute and 10cents per MB of air traffic with no monthly payment). This Blu phone is perfect for plans like this where you don't talk on the phone much and mostly use it on Wi-Fi and only need occasional network usage outside of Wi-Fi areas. It also works great as a spare phone or emergency phone that you can put in a car and only use it when your primary phone is not available.<br/><br/>Speaking of emergencies, thanks to the huge size, this phone has space for an amazingly big 3000MAh battery. Most phones come with 2000MAh batteries, so you already come with 50% more charge, and then, since this phone uses older, less powerful CPU, has no LTE power-hungry antennas or juice seeping 1080P screens, it can last amazing 10 days in stand-by mode before requiring recharging.<br/><br/>Another feature that is rare in US, but very common elsewhere, is dual SIM card capability. Essentially, it allows you to have to phone numbers from two different providers and switch back and forth depending on either coverage or ability to save money on calls. In many European countries people pay per-minute of air time and many providers give you free airtime if used within network (call from one mobile to another on the same provider). This way having two SIMs from two different providers that cover majority of all offerings, you can have an essentially free airtime by jumping from one provider to another depending on who you are calling.<br/><br/>BLU comes with KitKat 4.4.2 Android. This is one version behind the latest Lollipop (5.0) and is the most popular Android version right now. Do not buy this phone hoping that BLU would upgrade it to Lollipop. Most probably they won't as this is 2014 model and BLU has recently released 2015 models where they will concentrate support. What I like about this phone's Android, is that it comes mostly without any bloatware and very close to the Google reference Android with some very helpful improvements. The biggest of them is full support of Micro SD cards (up to 64GB) with phone allowing to use card as true extension of measly internal 8GB memory. If you know Google new Android versions, this capability was taken away and most Android phones from large providers like Samsung or Motorola come with either no memory card slot or a castrated version where you can not do anything with this memory outside of very limited use cases. BLU has modified 4.4.2 Android to have full usage of extended memory and automatically moves apps and any data (camera pictures, music, movies, etc.) to the memory card. I have verified that 64GB Class 10 Micro SDXC card is supported and greatly expands phone capabilities. Don't forget to buy a card with your phone as without it you will run into internal memory limitations very quickly.<br/><br/>The camera on this phone sucks. There is no way to sweeten it. It is very slow to focus (up to 1sec to take a picture from the time you press button), many pictures come either as out of focus or very soft, struggling to perform any zooming or cropping. Video camera is slow to refocus, resulting in breaks in the video when subject quickly moves and camera can not keep up. The front camera is measly 2MP and is only marginally usable in perfect lighting. Forget Skyping on this phone if you want your picture to come out like not a piece of crap. So the camera is usable for landscape photography in full daylight and not much else. I was trying to take pictures of my dog and they all came bad as he was moving and camera would not focus well or take a shot when he was already out of frame. Taking pictures of kids, pets, sprt games would just not work. Taking an occasional shot of an amazing sunset over ocean or some beautiful flower would look great but soft when zooming.<br/><br/>Bluetooth antenna is pretty strong and supports latest 4.0 Low energy mode. It's great to pair this phone with sport band or smart watch and has excellent signal when pairing with Bluetooth speakers. I can stream music to my speaker from 10 yards and two walls in between without issues.<br/><br/>BLU has very (and I mean VERY) modest specs, coming with old 1.2Gh quad-core CPU and 1Gb of RAM. Don't fool yourself with quad-core spec - it won't be able to multitask as memory is a bottleneck and any serious multitasking would result in phone hanging and requiring a hard reset. But if your ambitions are modest and you only need phone to chat/check Email/do light Web browsing or casual gaming, it would work great for you. Just remember - do not buy this phone for your kids if they are into gaming or heavy use of the phone. They will quickly push this phone past it's limitations and will be hugely dissapointed when it would not keep up with their demands and lock up on them multiple times per day.<br/><br/>Buy this phone if you want to use it instead of tablet and are OK with size when you need to carry it around. Buy it if you don't want to pay up to $1,000 for something that will break after first drop on the pavement or if you don't want to be locked into expensive multi-year cell plan from large providers. Buy it if you only call occasionally and don't plan to use it as a conference phone for hours and hours on speakerphone. Buy is if you need a spare phone that you don't plan to use heavily or take pictures with. Buy it for your older relatives who need large fonts on large screen and only have modest expectations to begin with.
I love this phone so much that I find myself staring at it.  It is such a cool phone, the sound is clear, the battery lasts for almost 2 days.  The design of the phone is so beautiful, it fits in my  hand perfectly, very comfortable.  I highly recommend this phone, the best feature about BLU is choosing any compatible network, I went to Best Buy to pick one, so easy.  I decided to start with ATT but I wasn't getting a strong signal (due to our big concrete building not BLU) at my work place so next week when it's expired I'm switching, LOVE THAT.  A phone 6 under $200 is a dream come true, even the Best Buy guys were curious about the OS and saying how consumers are getting smarter, it made me feel good.  This is a WINNER!  I've impressed a lot of people and now friends and family are considering it. Too much to tell, just buy it and NO I don't work for the company.
A quality large phone at a very low price. After 1 week I can say quality product long battery life no loaded junk apps and great reception in my area that historically has had limited cell phone reception. I may order a second phone too!
I ordered Studio 6.0 HD knowing it is not fancy SS or fruit brand. I needed a decent smart phone functions as it claims. So, I was fine when I had to upgrade firmware to make it operative upon opening the box, GPS was completely wrong from the outset, , and the screen was not very responsive. However, it dead without any warning on the 46th day after I received it. I could not return to Amazon anymore since it passed 30 day return window. I called Blu customer service and after more than 30 minutes of holding, told I needed to fill a form via email. I sent out the email right away on Friday. I received email saying the tech support will contact me within 3 business days. I have not heard from them since then. Completely silent.<br/><br/>I cannot give unbiased evaluation for the phone as I only tried one so far. My experience with the customer service/tech support is disappointing. It has been a week for me without phone. If you do not have a spare ready and your work/life heavily rely on the phone, I sincerely suggest you look for other options.<br/><br/>I will give you update everyday until this issue is resolved.<br/><br/>Update 1: I finally received email from Blu tech department this morning 7 days after the first phone call. They ask me to ship back to their Florida address. I have to ship the phone at my own expense. I am again very disappointed by their warranty policy.
ok so I have had it for just about a week. I am going from the blu studio 5.3ii to the blu studio 6.0 hd. Over all it is a better phone but there is some draw backs. 1st and foremost I dislike the fact that the battery is intergraded into the phone. That scares the hell out of me because I know after a year typically these batteries don't hold charges. The 2nd draw back is the charging system. The part where you plug it into the charger doesn't grab so if you even slightly move your phone while charging it will disconnect and not charge. So you can plug it in at night and think your phone will be charged in the morning and wake up to a dead battery.<br/><br/>The things that I like over my last phone are:<br/>- Camera is far better<br/>- Video recording is far better<br/>- Storage is double (yet not as high as some of the samsungs)<br/>- Large BRIGHT & CRYSTAL CLEAR screen<br/><br/>Sound quality for phone calls is just average and I have yet to be somewhere where I have not been able to get some service and some internet.<br/><br/>Hope that helps!<br/><br/>**********<br/>Update<br/><br/>Now Ive had the phone for about another week and now I am having issues with charging. While plugged in I still lose battery if I do simple things like send a text or check email. Ive never had a phone that while plugged in it lost power while using the phone. Also just the other day I had 60% batter life and knew I was going to be away from a charger for the rest of the night. So I plugged it in while I took a shower (not even a ten min shower) and came back and it was at 100% battery life. I am suspect that the batteries on the 6.0 HD are junk.
I read all the reviews good and bad before buying this cell phone.  My main reason for buying was the size of the screen and the price.  I'm not sure what those who gave this phone a bad review were looking for, but it has given me everything I wanted and more.<br/>The phone has great definition, bright, clear and crisp. I get great photos from both the front and rear cameras.  It's fast, easy to set up and everyone who sees it wants it.  I have had an iPhone and LG G2 and I would put this phone up against them any day. With a price that is 50% to 60% less than many smartphones of smaller size it is a winner all around.<br/>If there is a "con" to the "pros" it is that there doesn't seem to be any cases or screen protectors on the market yet, that's probably why on top of everything else that's good about this phone it came with a case and a screen protector.  Now the case isn't otter box comparable, but it will work until I find something better and it's a good indicator that the company was thinking about the consumer by including it.  Good job BLU!
I have only been using this device for one day<br/>Review may change, SO I love the device it's very nice size it is the best, everything seems to work just fine there are a few things I did not like such as it charges slow. The battery life is decent not the best . the review has false info on this device, states that it is on OS 4.2 and can be updated to 4.4 but I received mine on OS 5.0 straight brand new out of the box. This phone is worth the price it runs great so far . will update if anything changes. Phone is AWESOME THANK YOU.<br/>UPDATE: this phone is decent you get what you pay for , saying as the battery life is short takes for ever to charge, my screen bugs out while playing my games also certain apps crash with in 0.1 sec. Of opening. There is a bit more to complain about but its not a bad phone just needs improvement.<br/>UPDATE #2: THE PHONE IS ACTING TERRIBLE!! THE HOME KEY BACK KEY AND OTHER HAVE STOPPED RESPONDING TO touch I OWNED THIS PHONE FOR LESS THAN A MONTH
As far as the build quality and the materials go... this was actually a beautiful  phone. I was blown away when I first opened the box. However, once I tried to set it up; the first impression was quickly invalidated. The first thing I noticed when I took the phone out, peeled off the screen protector/spec sheet, is that the phone had already been turned on at some point even though the box was sealed with factory stickers. Not only that, it was past the set-up screen (and if you know anything about android phones: you can't get past the set-up screen until you actually set it up). Which means this phone was somehow "set-up" inside a sealed box/at the factory/something. I checked the settings to see if there was already someone's account on there, but there was not. While I was in settings, I tried adding my main google account. I added it, got my email, but when I went back into settings, it kept giving me sync errors when I checked the account status (and all my credentials were good, obviously, because I initially got my mail). I went to the Play Store to download my usual apps. It wouldn't connect. I went into the built-in app list and opened up the Google Settings app to see what information I could get from there. While I was in there, I planned on activating the android feature where you can find your phone's location online if you happen to lose it. Even with my GPS/location turned on in settings, it wouldn't let me activate the phone-finding feature because "google location services are not available in your region," or something like that. Which is odd, because every other android device I have allows it here in the U.S. My only thought is that this was shipped with an OS version that is based out of a banned country. That would explain none of my google services working or syncing (no app store access, location service access, no google server access to hangouts or any other such apps). It was just very disappointing because the phone itself was beautiful. The screen was absolutely gorgeous except for the fact that I couldn't load any apps or services to it. I did a factory reset and set it up fresh. Still didn't work. I did all the usual things like clearing the Google Play Services and Google Play Store data and caches, but still nothing. Tried it with other google accounts. Nothing. Set up a new account from the phone; nothing. I'm hoping my experience was just a fluke, and I'm choosing to exchange rather than refund, but until I get a unit that works with google services (which is the whole point of an android phone), I just can't recommend this to anyone. Also worth noting; any time you complain about an issue with a Blu phone on social media or sites like this, they'll say "contact us at such and such email address," but when you actually mail that address, no one typically responds. Hopefully my replacement works correctly when it arrives (and hopefully it arrives not powered on and past the set-up screen this time), but until then it's just 1 star from me.<br/><br/>*update*<br/>It should be noted that Blu has issued an update that fixes the out-of-the-box problems that prevented any google services to sync or any apps to be downloaded, so that right there bumps the review up a by a couple stars. The device itself feels very much like a Galaxy Mega in the hand (in build quality and size), and the screen is mostly beautiful... mostly. The viewing angles aren't the best, and when you get too far off center the colors really cool out towards the blue end of the spectrum, but most people don't look at their phone from the side, so that's not a deal breaker. The battery life is okay, but nothing to brag about. The first couple days, it was stellar, but now that it's been through a few discharge/recharge cycles, it has simply turned into a fairly average battery (I can mostly make it through a busy workday and not have to plug in for juice until late evening). Overall, it's been a mostly pleasant experience now that Blu has sorted out the initial connection issues in the original build of the OS. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that understands the limitations they're buying into.
I've had my BLU Studio 6.0 for just a couple of days now. The 5-star rating is based on all of the features for the price. You'll simply not get a 6" phone with a nice screen for this price anywhere. I was able to put my sim card in from AT&T;, reboot the phone, and it worked flawlessly - calls, text, and data (and of course wi-fi worked as expected). For folks that have mentioned slow data on 4G, I have experienced this, restart the phone seems to fix it (25 seconds to refresh Twitter feed down to 2-3 after the reboot)<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Solid phone, doesn't feel cheap or flimsy<br/>Nice, large, bright screen<br/>The audio boost feature works well, I'm not audiophile but compared the Beats sound boost on my old HTC its on par<br/>Camera placement is ideal, both are covered so lenses won't collect dust<br/>Comes with case, headphones, and screen protector<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The button layout is not ideal. The volume is located on the left side of the phone, exactly opposite of the lock button. I find myself constantly changing the volume of the phone when trying to lock it.<br/>The lock button is also somewhat difficult to locate and press on its on, some times it takes me a few tries.<br/>The external speak at max volume pops, turn it down a notch or two and its fine<br/>They keyboard seems to struggle with fast typing, not sure if it is the screen or the Google keyboard, I'll switch it out and update my review.<br/>The camera is very slow. I am not able to get decent pictures if there is any sort of movement because of this delay. I tend to use the burst mode to take multiple pictures and hope I get one, even then I don't always get it.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a good phone for surfing, even reading, without having to carry a tablet then this is a great device. If you need a phone that takes good pictures, move along.
Oh yeah. I bought this phone and i love it, my sister saw it and wants one as well . i strongley recommended this company to everyone.
I bought the Blu Studio HD 6.0 model D651 from Walmart's website for $140. I was coming from a Samsung Galaxy s3. I hate to sound paranoid but I truly feel that once your contract is up your phone starts acting crazy. My s3 battery wouldn't hold a charge so I got a 7500mah battery from zero lemon. That was great then suddenly my phone stopped recognizing my charger. I cleaned to port and still it would be picky. Anyway, I didn't want to sign another 2yr contract or lose my unlimited data to get a new phone and I definitely didn't want to to pay $600 for a new smart phone. I stumbled onto the Blu series of phones. I researched this particular model and was surprised to find that it ran on 4G, it would support my mobile hot spot, and it came with Kitkat 4.4.2.<br/><br/>When it arrived I compared it to my friends Galaxy 5 and it seemed to be comparable. She bought her phone in November and is still paying it off with her service plan. I consider myself a pretty heavy user. I use my phone for social media, to record and share the live uncompressed music that my band creates. I also use my phone as my remote desktop when I'm out of the office. So,  my needs are vast and any phone that I use has to be versatile. I have an iphone and for the most part iphone could not accommodate my needs. The galaxy s3 could and my Blu phone definitely can.<br/><br/>Data:<br/>On first start up it's a little slow but for whatever reason things improved. I know web browsing speeds vary greatly depending on wifi and data connections but I'd love it to be just a little faster but that could also be an issue with the Chrome browser, I think it needs an update. Switching between data and wifi was smooth for me with no interruption in streaming. With my s3 I would have to wait for things to buffer if the connection type changed.<br/><br/>Multitasking:<br/>Multitasking was flawless for me. I was streaming a podcast (over data connection) in double twist player, while downloading the sims free play (full app 1GB) and netflix from the app store. There was no lag what-so-ever.<br/><br/>Battery:<br/>The battery isn't bad. If you're a heavy user like me you will probably need to put it on the charger by lunch time. Just remember to wait until the battery warning comes on before you charge to help the battery last longer. Short cycle charges kill battery longevity and these batteries are not removable.<br/><br/>All in all I'm enjoying my device so far and I'm happy to see that we, as consumers, have more options out there. We don't have to be trapped in contracts, financing phones that have features that most of us will never need or use. WE HAVE A CHOICE!!!!!!
I am trying to find a reason not to like this phone and I can't.  It seems everything I toss at it seems to work as expected.  I am not a gamer so I can't speak to that part of it's usability.  I do have to say it does complain, or at least Google Play Store when the 2G of storage is reaching down to 250M available, saying prematurely the phone is full, but I see this error reported online regarding other devices as well.  It may just be the KitKat update (available free once you buy the phone) or temporary Google Play issue.  You can side load the apps when it nears full and then fill it full from that if you wish.  I keep all my apps on the SD card with no issues.  All apps are now on the supported quality 64G card.  Was also able to load my entire music collection onto this phone and it serves well now as a foreign traveling companion (Unlocked + 2 SIM slots - awesome!) with both music and provider flexibility.  It is large but I don't need magnifying glasses to use it like I do with the iPhone.  It is actually something that you can use to Google a subject out on the road, and relatively easily read and make sense of what you looked up, unlike the other tiny screen devices on the market that turn even the slightest task into a "swipe fest".  It also accepts the OTG adapters built for Samsung which allows you to attach a camera card or external flash or hard drive directly to it.  Handy for working with and emailing photos from a higher quality camera.  And speaking of camera, I don't believe the quality is that of the iPhone 5 camera, but still this camera is not too shabby.  As a photographer, I haven't yet given into a smartphone being my mainstay of documenting my life, moving along always with the Blu in one pocket and HQ Canon P&S; in the other, but I can see that being the trend.<br/><br/>Now the only reason I don't give this phone 5 stars is that I got a good one of the lot.  Heaven forbid if you buy one and don't return it to Amazon within the 30 days if it has a defect.  I have been banned (all my posts deleted) from the Blu Developers online forum for criticizing their support and their design of models such as the Blu Studio 5.5 which has a very flimsy SD card trap door that breaks after about 10 swaps of the card.  Additionally Blu support is a black hole when asking for second level support, seemingly just sending out canned answers to various reported problems, at least in the instance of the 5.5 I owned for 3 weeks.  Plus if it is your desire to root or do experimenting with the OS, Blu won't provide you a factory backup of the image, and as of today there doesn't appear to be anyone online offering one as well, so if that is your intention, to root and to experiment, do a lot of research on it before buying.  For example, the program iRoot2 which is the only known rooting application, turns the factory test page to Chinese, other than that it seems to work OK.  So be careful.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I wouldn't trade this phone for any other at the moment, at least not in the price range I paid for it.  As an adventure traveler I am a phone "dropper" and I know it is just a matter of time before I have a small knot in my stomach vs.that end of life feeling others get at their own "Samsung snap moment".<br/><br/>P.S. My Blu Studio 6.0 did not come with a headset and the Blu Studio 5.5 I had (until it failed) did.  Just a FYI ...
I am a long time iPhone and Samsung Galaxy user...and so far I love this phone (yes...even more than my iPhone). It was super easy to update to Kit Kat and activate using my Straight Talk service. *NOTE: You will need the regular size SIM card (not the micro or nano)* I added a SD card and moved all apps possible to the SD card to save space. I have a ton of internal memory left as a result.<br/>It is a big phone, but not at all awkward to hold while talking. Everything was super easy to use and so far the battery life has been great.<br/>The added bonus of a screen guard and case is icing on the cake!<br/>It is as nice as any of the Samsung products, and I like that this phone is not logged down with unnecessary bloatware.<br/>For less than $160, you cannot go wrong.<br/><br/>**UPDATE**Upon taking my phone off WIFI, it is indeed a 4G phone, not the 3G as stated in the specs.
As of 1/16/2015.. I am going to update my review. I dropped the rating down to 3 stars.. On December 16th 2014.. My phone woundn't turn on, and stopped charging. I sent the phone in for Warranty repair. It took 3 weeks to get a replacement. Blu deemed the phone "defective".. I got a replacement, tried to turn on the phone, it won't turn on, tried to connect it to a charger, the phone wouldn't charge. Otherwise, I got another brick.. The replacement phone was shipped ground.. I have reason to believe maybe the battery froze in shipping due to -20 below temperatures, and -40 wind chills. Since the battery is hardwired, and opening up the case will void the warranty, I have no choice but to send it back in AGAIN. The first replacement took a turnaround of about 3 weeks.. I will give the benefit of the doubt and say the phone broke during the holidays, and maybe Blu Product repair was backlogged. But I probably will be without a phone another 3 weeks. I wish Warranty repair would have a way to swap phones like pay $150.00 deposit, and they send you a phone right away.. but they don't. At this point in time I am disappointed. It is a great phone when I can get the phone to work.. :(<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>I had the phone for a few weeks now. My previous phone was a Galaxy S2, I had that phone for about 3 years. Unfortunately, I left that phone in my pocket, and it went through the wash. I had to replace the S2..<br/><br/>I was looking for another Galaxy phone for a replacement.. .. Maybe an S3, S4, or S5, but the prices for an unlocked were still out of the range I wanted to pay. I really enjoy the service from H2O wireless. $30.00 to $40.00 a month for a Smartphone plan. I priced contract phones, call me cheap, but I can't justify forking out $300.00 for a new phone, and paying $80.00 a month for the next 24 months.<br/><br/>Anyway.. I ran across a couple of reviews for the Blu Studio 6.0 HD... I researched it further on You Tube... And thought I would give it a try. The phone exceeds my expectations.<br/><br/>Pros..<br/>Processor speed is great<br/>Screen is large (6 inches)<br/>Phone is not flimsy. This phone is larger, and thicker than the Samsung Note<br/>I would say its built more solid than the galaxy note.<br/>Phone comes with a screen protector, and a case. The case isn't anything fancy, but at least its free<br/>To my surprise my phone comes with an FM Radio.<br/>No AT&T; Bloatware, or any other bloatware of any kind.<br/>Phone came stocked with Android Kit Kat operating system<br/>Unlocked, the phone took my H2O wireless sims with no issues.<br/>dual sims.. I no longer have to carry around 2 phones.<br/>Phone seems to have very good battery life<br/>no problem tethering and tethering not blocked<br/><br/>Cons<br/>I don't like built in batteries with any phone in general.. I would like to have the option to easily pop a fresh battery in from my spare wall charger. I can't do that with this phone.. . Also, I had Android phones that had built in batteries in the past, if the phone locked up.. I have to wait for the battery to go completely dead in order to give the phone a fresh reboot. (which could be a week) I never had such an issue with this phone, I am concerned that will happen.<br/><br/>I had a couple of  issues when I turned on the phone, into some sort of diagnostic menu.. And the phone is in Chinese. After some playing around, I was able to clear that.<br/><br/>There are some paid apps that worked fine on on my S2 that won't work on the Blu Studio 6.0.  I guess that's expected.<br/><br/>The time lapse video is a great feature, but the camera doesn't take the greatest pictures. If you are using it for posting on Facebook, or Social media, this phone will work fine for that. Camera also takes panoramic pictures.<br/><br/>From what I can tell, it is difficult to find any other cases, screen protectors for this phone. Just because the phone isn't mass produced, and has an odd size.<br/><br/>My Galaxy S2 was easy to fix with broken screens, charging ports, speakers, microphones.. It might be difficult to cheaply find spare parts for this phone.<br/><br/>Otherwise, everything seems to be working great. I would highly recommend this phone to anyone... Most of my issues that I addressed are minor. This phone does everything I want it to do an then some. My wife and daughter are gamers, and they played games using this phone. The phone keeps right up with their Iphones, and is sometimes faster. If the phone didn't boot to the Chinese menu once in awhile, I'd give it 5 stars.<br/><br/>UPDATE 12/10/2014. There was a software revision a few weeks ago.. I am no longer seeing the Chinese menu.. I will revise with 5 stars.
The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I just got the phone. But I plugged it in and immediately dove right in. It's bigger than the iPhone 6, and it fits in the Nexus 6 phone cases. It's like having one of the big name phones without the high price tag. I had my doubts about Blue, but all the reviews and YouTube tutorials were right, this phone is great. I highly recommend this brand, and if you're thinking about purchasing look no further. It's rediculous to pay $300 - $900 for something that fits in your pocket. Save your rent money.
Okay, I made sure to wait before writing a review because I thought it was just a new phone that was irritating me.<br/><br/>I had to purchase a phone, it had fairly good reviews, and I was on a VERY Limited budget- but since I needed to get a phone, I figured I was buying a mid-range phone (smart) so I wouldn't need to replace it as soon as one that was super cheap.<br/>1.  Can't use this phone without headset,<br/><br/>2.  HUGE, I thought I could get over the side but unless I'm wearing a suit jacket there isn't a female pocket that can house this phone; meaning if you want to walk around the house with your phone- it doesn't fit in the BUSTIEST bra- you need to walk around with a purse,<br/><br/>3.  Updates are clunky- I've had the most problems with this phone,<br/><br/>4.  tried to eat up data within the first two days of having it- Never had a phone that constantly tried to update in the background so much, in the day of finding everything to shut off I actually took out my card so I could find everything that was running so it didn't chew through more data,<br/><br/>5.  The power button and the volume keys are on the sides- the only part that would be exposed if you magically got it to fit in a pocket... however, if your pocket bumps it, it would shut down your phone.<br/><br/>6.  I've had it this phone since April 1, 2015, it is now the 22nd- it now has some sort of glitch where if I try to call someone- it will try to call two other people after I hang up.  There is nothing on the screen and I've never dropped the phone.  So if I'm not paying attention it tries to call two other people... this has been for the past 2 days.  I tried rebooting, nothing.<br/><br/>7.  If you hold down the volume key, and the power key at the same time (easily done due to the configuration of keys) it starts a boot configuration key... ... IN JAPANESE.  You can't just hold the power key- it makes you do the same test pattern every time- in Japanese you don't know what the heck it is, but it ends up being Power, volume up, volume down, back, home, window.  You can't break out of it- and you can't take out the battery because it's locked in.  If you have this phone you can hold the Power+Volume Down+Home Key and eventually it will reboot... maybe.  Took me forever to figure that out.<br/><br/>I could go on;  I'm stopping myself.  I paid 90 dollars for this phone because I used my Amazon credits to pay for it.  Not Worth It!  The screen is crystal clear- but if I ever drop it, obviously that will be kaput.<br/><br/>I have nothing good to say about this phone; it's a product of my budget and desperation that I am stuck with this phone.  I do not have the money to afford better, but I won't be wasting my money on this again.  I agree with one of the other reviewers that it's a bad sign when something comes with headphones out of the box.<br/><br/>If you are unfortunate enough to try this phone- invest in a blue tooth headset and HOPE you never lose it or it breaks.
i dont usually do product reviews, but this is worth every penny.<br/>why pay almost 700.00 for a samsung mega or note 3<br/><br/>this phone specs wise is not a joke great cameras botrh front and rear. has a quad core processor. i added a 16 gig memory stick and good to go.<br/><br/>i have not had any problems and the battery last so long. Also the phone is unlocked and thats great.!!!<br/><br/>im on att network and it runs smooth.<br/><br/>thinking about buying another one for my girl.<br/><br/>hope this helps anyone considering the phone!
When I purchased this phone I was a little sceptical about the quality of the device that I would be getting...  I am happy to write a review about this one and feel as though I really received a lot of phone for the money. There are a couple of recommendations that you will need to do with it right out of the box to get the best performance out of the phone, but once done the phone will perform just as well in most tasks as the more expensive top tier phones that are available today. First, the phone will need to be updated to Android 4.4.  After updating I found the stock Google launcher to be a little light on features and a little sluggish feeling on the touch input so I went with Nova launcher which completely took care of any input lag that the phone had out of the box. I also went with SwiftKey for the keyboard because the stock google keyboard felt a little laggy. The changes to the launcher and the keyboard made all the difference in the world as the input speeds can be manually adjusted in these free apps. The phone now feels the way I would expect a $500 plus dollar phone to feel, and when  ompared side by side to a Samsung galaxy Mega,  felt smoother and faster.  Gaming performance is acceptable if thats your thing and the phone will play all of the newer 3d titles reasonably well. Spec wise,  you get a phone that is comparable in performance to a  Samsung Galaxy Mega with an Arm Cortex a7 quad  core processor, a nice Hd 6" screen in a nice thin profile similar to the thickness of a Galaxy S3 making it easy to pocket. Great deal for less than $200 bucks<br/>☺
This is bull s*** I got one from Amazon and the shit don't even work any one else make sure it's new win you buy one
First let me say that I have owned a Blu phone before this one and I loved it and recommended it to others so when I bought a second phone I was surprised at the number of issues it had from the beginning. I  have had this phone for less than a month and I'm already ready to get rid of it!  It has a built in battery, which I hate because the phone runs hot a lot and it will tell you to remove the battery when it runs hot but you can't! Also the charger can be plugged into it and still your battery level will go down or stay stuck on a low percentage for several hours! When watching videos on YouTube the video player will often make the video blurry and then focus again. Lastly you have to reboot a lot to get pages on the internet to load. With issues like these I'm sorry I ever endorsed Blu phones and doubt I'll buy another.
As far as WiFi use on your network as well as the other features of the phone I would give it 5 stars.  However, I am yet to get the phone to work on a Metro PCS/T-Mobile cell network.  I went to the local Metro PCS store and puchased a new GMS SIM and they initially activated it.  They were able to get it to interface with the Metro PCS / T-Mobile network in my area, that is for an hour.  After that there were no bars and no service.  So I contacted Metro PCS main office and they tried to reactivate the phone to no avail - and suggested that I revisit my local Metro PCS store.  So before doing that  I contacted BLU (the manufacturer of the phone) in Miami and their suggestion was to do a hard boot of the phone.  You have to hold down both the volume and on/off buttons at the same time and hold it until you get to a bios sort of menu where erasing cashe and hard booting are options.  I did that and no improvement.  So this afternoon I plan to revisit my local Metro PCS store.  If that doesn't work I may have to switch carriers to get the phone to work properly.  So if this is the case I feel justified in taking off two stars for false advertising of Metro PCS as a working carrier.<br/><br/>If I get this issue resolved I will revisit this review and provide additional information.  If the issue is a defective phone or if the fix works by Metro PCS then I will revisit the star rating I have given.  I've never been so frustrated with a phone as I am here.<br/><br/>UPDATE:  So I met with the manager of a corporate Metro PCS store who had lots of knowledge about this product.  So the BLU Studio 6.0 HD has two SIM slots.  However the technician that installed my Metro PCS/T-Mobile SIM yesterday plugged it into GSM slot #2 thinking that slot #1 was just for CDMA.  DON'T DO THAT .  Slot #1 is actually a GSM OR CDMA slot. Slot #1 can be used either for GSM OR CDMA.  Make sure that the GSM SIM is placed into that slot first otherwise you will lose your network the next time you turn it on and it will not come back - even if it was first activated that way.  Fill slot #1 up first before placing another SIM (if you choose to do so with another carrier) in slot #2.  The manual and documentation from BLU is really bad on this.  For the reason of such frustration the phone gave me initially and no documentation to clear things up I was tempted to only add back one star - but I can't.  This is a terrific phone.  The whole staff at Metro PCS were gawking over this phone and one tech told me that she like the BLU more than other pricier phones that they sell.  You can read about the many features and benefits of this phone from other reviewers.  However I will mention that I had no trouble at all pairing my wireless bluetooth headset to this phone and it works great.  The WiFi I have already mentioned and my home network works great with it.  I would highly recommend purchasing this phone.  However remember the issue I raised about SIM slot #1 first before SIM slot #2.<br/><br/>UPDATE 2/26/2015 - The phone works better than I originally thought it would.  It has many of the features of the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo and is priced a lot less.  See specs and comparison with Samsung at http://bluproducts.com/images/pdfguides/STUDIO60HDSG.pdf<br/><br/>UPDATE 3/18/2015 - Still going strong.  No phone reception problems.  I used the phone at the doctor's office to do some stock trading.  It worked like a champ.  It is a very fast phone.  I was able to get live streaming quotes on a number of stocks simultaneously without any lag or freeze issues.  I really really like this phone.
Tested with T Mobile data and calls, no problem. Excellent performance.<br/>Screen is great and crisp. Also I travel to Mexico and I used both SIM Cards, I used Telcel, and works great data, text and calls. No problems, no errors at all. Also I added 64 GB for 20 dlls Samsung Card works incredible.<br/>I have used 3 weeks no complains.<br/>I came from IPhone 5, yes if you are tech guy you would notice, otherwise everything is OK. I have no tested for game purposes since I don't play games. Skype, Facebook, MagicJack, browse and video like you tube, TWC, Netflix or any video source can be done without problems, TWC Phone service, Skydrive and other typical applications works great, no lags or problems at all.<br/>I switched because I want to be free, I can travel to Mexico without any problem moving from T-Mobile network to TELCEL without any problem I even can use at the same time, or use MaginJack from mexico to make calls here in USA.<br/>Yes you will need at least 30 days to understand the logic and the basic process problems to solve how to connect to a network, cellular mobile network or use two sim cards at the same time. But that is all part of the process to be free, yes you will be able to do anything that an IPhone can do, but it will cost you 1/3 of the cost.<br/>I am very happy with this device, no complains or problems with the phone.<br/>Battery last me, two days extensive use or 4 or 5 days if you are just connected waiting to receive calls like me most of all the times.<br/>Yes you need to learn how to improve the use of your battery, like any other person to maximize the resources.<br/>Camera, well I have to tell you it is not as quick as the IPhone 5, but if you understand the way and the process to take it you will be just fine, resolution is good, I usually use the camera like any other normal person and I can live with it, and photos are not as bad as other persons complain,  but if you are extensive user of the camera and like to take photos everywhere of everything well you will complain.<br/>Video calls can be made without any problem using Skype or any other app. Great advantage with out cost.<br/>Memory and SD Card, I have so much room to have photos, videos, data and other applications that can not complain about it.<br/>Well that's my review, like to inform you because I am very efficient consumer and like to translate my feeling using my first android experience.
First off I have to give it up to the seller 232 Tech, they were very helpful in getting me a phone replacement. This phone is amazing, feels big at first but I'm sure I can get used to it. The processor doesn't lag on me while multitasking. The camera is okay but best when you leave the setting on Auto its the flashes with an "A" logo. Other than that the phone looks sleek and amazing. The phone is definitely worth the price and would recommend it to someone whose going to spend hundreds of dollars. I mean yeah you can spend all that money, but for what? You can do the same thing on this phone just as well. The only flaw about this phone is....hmmmm its hard to say lol. Good luck to anyone thinking of buying this phone.
Please read the entire review. I have always been put-off when some says a phone is "sexy." However, with this Blu Studio 6 HD phone, i can't stop picking it up and wanting to just hold it. The phone is thin light weight and the screen is so beautiful. I had been holding out to buy the LG G3 headset, when I ran across a Blu Studio 5.5 in Micro Center. The phone was $189.00 with a 30 day no question asked return. So, I took it for a test run. The phone was great! However, it suffered from poor battery life and the screen resolution was off to me ( I'm a tech-head; the average person would find it the screen fine). I use my phone at work and the battery life was a deal breaker so I returned it. If there was an aftermarket battery I would go back.<br/><br/>Now more about the Studio 6 HD. I brought it here on Amazon under the assumption it was new, IT WAS NOT! Now, I have purchased numerous Android phones and they all-ways come needing to be set-up.  Not this phone. It was USED! Someone had set the phone up and simply deleted the account information. The phone booted directly to the home screen not the set-up mood. I blame this on the seller for misrepresenting the item. I purchased a new phone and should have gotten one.<br/><br/>I went ahead and entered my account information to see how the phone would work.  I had to reboot the phone twice to get the Google Play Store to load. Now  it loads without a problem. As i mentioned the screen is great! The phone has a lot of great features. The battery life is excellent. I went 8 hours normal phone usage  at work (also facebooking and playing games)  and only used 40% of the battery. However, it is not a finished product. The one issue other than the phone not being NEW; is the GPS does not work. the Google Maps app just crashes each time. I installed the WAZE app and the GPS still does not work. In addition, I have not been able to updated the phone to Kitkat. That I can not blame on the seller.<br/><br/>With all the above being said i like the phone; however, I do not like being lied to or taking advantage of. The seller misrepresented the item and he should fix it, with question and without hesitation. I will keep YOU potential buyers posted.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I returned the original phone back to Amazon without any issues; it was a painless experience. My replacement phone arrived in the correct condition. I had to sign into the phone as if i was the first owner (which sometime is not true). The phone booted-up without any issues. I was able to sign right into the Google Play store. However, I am convinced the GPS issue is inherit to this phones model. The new phone found my location without any issue. When a attempted to navigate with the phone the app crashed. The GPS will now work with other programs but they crash as well or show inaccurate locations.<br/><br/>It's really disappointing because the phone performs so well in other areas. The battery is great. The portable hotspot, camera, internet, Google Now and my other apps work flawlessly. If the GPS worked on this phone I would give it five stars. With that said, I will change my initial rating of one star to three. The issue with the seller has been resolved. I'm now going to wait for the kitkat update to see if that fixes the phone. If not, I may return it. If the GPS is not a deal breaker for you, I recommend this phone. The phone gets 1 1/2 thumbs up.<br/><br/>Update:  The kitkat update fixed the GPS problem. The phone works well now.
After almost 5 months or so, the screen started flickering horribly. It would give me a continuously pulsing distorted image. To make matters even worse, BLU support is very difficult to get on to. Their business hours are limited and their calling queues can be really long.Overall, I'm very disappointed with this purchase. I wouldn't recommend this device to anyone.
UPDATE:<br/>After giving this phone a rave review I have to agree with those who've given it a bad one.  After leaving a rave review for the phone, I dropped if after having it a few weeks and all of a sudden I could hear callers but they couldn't hear me.  Other than that it was working fine.  I spent many hours with BLU customer support.  One woman there told me to do a Hard Reset and I lost ALL the stuff I had on the phone....phone numbers of contractors I was waiting to hear from, calendar notations, notes to myself, EVERYTHING.  Yes she told me to back it up, but since I didn't have anything saved on the phone that I knew of (i.e. pictures)  I didn't think I needed to.  Big mistake.  Anyway, after waiting ages for an available rep and going through hours of customer support on the phone (thank goodness I had access to a land line for this) they agreed to take it back since it was still under warranty.  They sent me an email with the label and I sent it off, but not before taking it in to a repair place because I really needed to have a phone. They said it was probably the microphone and if it was still under warranty I should send it back. They also told me it was a very cheap phone and that it was probably the microphone.<br/><br/>In the meantime I had to have a cell phone so I bought another one for approx. $99, an Amazon Warehouse deal that I got within 2 days.  I began using it and found that, like the last one, the volume was not terribly good, especially on speaker, but tolerable, and it seemed to be working fine.  To re-activate the SIM card I had to pay another $20 to my carrier.  By now I've now paid $168 for the 1st phone, $99 for the second, $25 for first activation and $20 for the second activation for a total of $312.  I begin to think I should have gotten a better phone, but I really liked this one so I wanted to stick with it.  My daughter suggested I buy a better case to protect it in case I dropped it, so I bought the fold over carrying case for the phone thinking this would do the job.  After about two weeks I got my old phone back (or maybe a new one...there was no explanation as to what was wrong...nothing in writing at all....just a phone in a mailing envelope wrapped in bubble wrap.)<br/><br/>After using the 2nd phone for about a month, and changing carriers to see if I could get better support (adding another $25 to my costs) things are going along fine when I once again dropped the phone.  Once again I could hear callers but they couldn't hear me, despite having a super protective case.  Having been through this already, I knew it was the crappy microphone mechanism again (YES IT'S A CHEAPLY MADE PHONE) and I once again got on the phone to BLU.  Once again they said they couldn't issue me an address for the return unless I did a Hard Reset.  Rather than go through it all again ("Do the Hard Reset and Call Us Back" means talking to a different person the next time who will need all your information again even though they have my records right there in front of them, and have to spell it all back to you, letter by letter....GEEZ!!!)  I just said forget it I will just use the phone they returned to me (after paying yet another activation fee, bringing my costs up to $337.  At this point I'm ready to kiss this shoddily made cell phone goodbye and go back to Samsung.  It's a shame because I loved using it (it was easy to learn), but it's a crappy piece of merchandise and BLU's Customer Service leaves a great deal to be desired.  Some of their tech reps can understand immediately what the problem is and others offer you only the hard reset (wiping out all your info) as a solution.<br/><br/>I dropped my husband's iphone the other day and it's fine.  I dropped a friend's Samsung also and it is also fine.  The repair guys said a well made phone wouldn't break just because it's dropped once or twice.<br/><br/>This BLU product sucks and I'll not be buying another BLU product.
At first blush, this is an great phone.  Big bright screen, lots of storage, 4G connection from AT&T;, great battery life, and on and on.  But the screen is very brittle!  I've broken two of these just getting out of my car with no pressure on the screen - just the phone sitting in my pocket (broke one a month after buying, and ordered a second only to have the same thing happen about a month later!)  It wasn't dropped or damaged any other way prior to the screen cracking.  Now, I've had a cell phone since at about 1994/1995 when I got my first bag phone - and I have NEVER broken the screen on any phone I've ever had.  It may be scratch resistant, but it just seems like the phone is too skinny and doesn't provide any strength to the screen.  As I said, the screen is very brittle and will crack (and disable the underlying digitizer) with very little pressure on it.
I really like it! It took some time to get used to the size, but other than that I have had no problems. Damn good phone.
I dont know whats going on but the last 3 phones i bought were defective!!! Ok so a few months ago I purchased this phone (blu 6.0 hd), It was perfect and no issues. Had it for a couple months before it was stolen. So now just recently i decided to get it again and also purchace one for my mom. Right off the bat my mothers phone bottom menu buttons werent working properly so we sent it back to be replaced. As we were waiting for the new one to arrive i noticed my phone had a battery charge issue. I had plugged it in to be charged when it was at about 15% and then 10 minutes later it was at 100% Uh .. no! So i un plugged the charger and needless to say the battery started to discharge at a rapid rate. I then plugged the charger back in and it still discharged. This doesnt happen all the time but it shouldnt happen at all. My mother got her replacement phone a couple days ago. The menu buttons work now but she is experiencing the same battery charge issue as I am. We both live in different houses so i doubt it has anything to do with our electrical system. This is a shame since this is a great phone otherwise. Maybe this is a bad batch. I bought from amazon this time. i cant remember where i purchased before.
It is the perfect phone for folks who don't care about brand names and need a good smart phone. Be real, how many smart phone users are using all the bells and whistles on the latest Samsung model? This phone does not have all the latest technology, but it does what I need/want it to do 100% (e-mail, facebook, hangout, web, stream movie, picture/video, metronome, flash, google translate and much more with android)<br/>The only complaint I have is this phone has to use its power/data cord that comes with the package.
If you are on a budget and on the market for a cheap, unlocked phone, this is a phone you need to consider. Specs-wise, it is comparable to the Galaxy Note 3 Neo. The HD screen is amazing to look at, battery life is on par with the Note 2, and the screen size is MASSIVE.<br/><br/>Although this phone is great, it does have it's drawbacks. One thing I've noticed is that if you play graphic-intense games, you will notice the top part of the phone heating up. Nothing too worrisome though. Also, if you have had the Note 2 or Note 3 before, compared to those phones there is a noticeable lag on the processor for the Blu Studio 6.0. I know that this is a budget-friendly phone so I can let that slide. Another is that if you use the screen protector included in the bundle, once you apply it there's a noticeable (at least to me) touchscreen responsiveness issue where you may need to press your selection numerous times before it registers your input. Not too big of a deal for me because I decided to not use the screen protector altogether.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoy this cheaper alternative compared to the 500-700 price tag of the unlocked Note 3/Note 2. Weigh the pros and cons before you purchase, but I can thoroughly say I am very happy with my purchase since this is at an unlocked price as it stands.
Overall I'm very happy with the phone. I have "the other" major service provider… the one that starts with an "A" and ends with a "T"…  I didn't want to have to renew my contract for 2 more years so Blu was a good option for me. Before you read on, this phone WILL NOT WORK ON VERIZON!<br/><br/>Set up is super easy. Before turning on the phone, charge the phone completely, then install your SIM card, then turn it on. It will automatically set itself up for your provider and be ready to use.<br/><br/>Follow the instructions for updating to Android 4.4.2 here…  http://bluproducts.com/index.php/android-software-updates  Super Easy<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>• Great screen - Netflix looks great, very bright, nice color, games play well too<br/>• Excellent battery life<br/>• No "bloatware" (all that extra software your service provider installs that you can't remove)<br/>• SD Card Slot - You can set up the phone to install new apps to the SD as soon as they download<br/>• Good sound from tiny speaker<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>• GPS is slow to lock on when you first start<br/>• No notification lights on the front to let you know you have waiting emails, texts, calls, etc..<br/>• Lack of accessories, it comes with a case, but good luck trying to buy something different<br/>• Call quality is fair, but not great. This phone replaced a dying GS3 that had amazing call quality<br/><br/>If you need a good phone, off contract, and you can deal without the LED indicator lights, this is a good deal.
Blu might not be well known here in the U.S. but if you are looking for a great smart phone but do not want to spend a lot of money . blu might be the phone for you . blu studio 6.0 HD is great for watching video as the screen is bright clear and colorful . switching from app to app to any other task is fast and relatively lag free . you definitely get more than what you pay for with this phone .
I was skeptical of purchasing this item as I was not familiar with the name nor familiar with a phablet; I must say that it is everything that the product details listed and my son could not be more pleased.  My family has used  the "bigger name" smart phones and the only difference is the "bigger" price.  Very good product and I definitely recommend this smart phone/phablet.
I started out last year with the BLU Studio Mini LTE, a nice little LTE phone with some great features. It has been a solid, reliable phone since I got it. My only problem is that the screen on the Mini is 4.5", and I'm in my mid-40s with presbyopia (bad vision). I also find a need for a tablet-like device when I'm out working or playing, and so I began my search for a replacement for my reliable, lovable BLU Studio Mini LTE.<br/><br/>I first tried a 7" phablet. While it worked well, and I was very pleased with it, the size was just too much. I decided to try again, and went back and forth between the BLU Studio 6.0 HD and the BLU Studio 6.0 LTE. My Mini was an LTE, but even though Straight Talk would support it, where I live there's not much in the way of LTE coverage, so that wasn't really a factor. Price WAS a factor, and the LTE was and still is significantly more expensive. For that higher price you get a slightly better battery, a slightly faster CPU, and a slightly better front/back camera. The screen resolution is a bit better on the LTE but that big resolution draws a bit more CPU/GPU power, too, and some say it's overkill on a 6" screen. The screen size is the same, they both currently run Android 4.4 KitKat out of the box, and they're both Quad Core. The HD is slightly thinner, but the LTE is 14% lighter than the HD. In benchmarks, they come up pretty close to one another. The LTE offers more storage space and RAM, but again, you pay extra for that.<br/><br/>In the end, I went with price vs. "slightly better" features. Sure, the LTE is the better phone in many ways, but considering that benchmarks reveal that I'm not losing too much power by going with the HD, and a 64GB micro SD card takes care of the difference in storage space, I thought it was a better choice for me. The final factor was that a national brick-and-mortar chain started selling the HD for a reasonable price, and I decided to take the plunge and grab one to try it. If it was terrible, I could just return it, right?<br/><br/>It turns out I have no desire to return it. It's wonderful. The only bump in the road was that I had a micro SIM, and had to grab a SIM adapter because this phone uses the regular-sized SIMs. Once I got the adapter in place, my Straight Talk number was working fine. The phone comes with a whole list of APNs built in (to set up your data connection with your service provider), but I found better results when I entered the APN suggested by Straight Talk (though there IS a Straight Talk APN built into this phone, apparently). Other APNs listed are:<br/><br/>AT&T;<br/>Net10<br/>AT&T; GoPhone<br/>Red Pocket<br/>Black Wireless<br/>H20 Wireless<br/><br/>I can't testify as to how well any of those work, but if you're wondering if this unlocked phone will work with your carrier, you can be pretty sure it will if it's one of the ones on that list.<br/><br/>This phone has a nice 3000 mAh Li-Polymer battery, and it lasts a good long while. It's rated to have 3G talk time of 24 hours, 3G stand-by time of 37.1 days, 2G talk time of 40 hours, and 2G stand-by time of 40.8 days. The down side is that this phone's battery is non-removable, like an iPhone or tablet. This is necessary on a big phone like this. The 6" phones with removable batteries all have much lower-power batteries as a result of that feature, and don't last nearly as long as this one. It's a trade-off, but I figure I swap phones every couple years anyway, so I doubt this one's battery will stop taking a charge before I move on to another phone.<br/><br/>It supports Wireless 802.11b/g/n and does have the ability to tether/hotspot. I don't recommend doing that with Straight Talk, as they forbid it in their terms of use, and will terminate your account if they catch you. However, if you're with a provider that allows it, the feature is supported here.<br/><br/>Of course, this is a Dual SIM phone, but I haven't a need for that feature at this point. I don't travel overseas, and I don't have any intention of paying another provider for service while I'm still using Straight Talk. You should know, however, that BOTH of the SIM slots are full-sized slots.<br/><br/>The GPS works great. It's fast and accurate. No problems there.<br/><br/>The front camera is decent for a 5MP phone camera. I've no complaints. Pictures turn out sharp and clear. The front-facing camera is 2MP, but it's sufficient for selfies, video chat, etc..<br/><br/>This phone does indeed have a proximity sensor, which is handy for blanking the screen when you're talking on the phone. It also has an accelerometer and gyroscope, so it does react to shakes, tilts, etc. for various apps. It does not have a compass, however. This was no big deal to me, as my car has a built-in compass.<br/><br/>Of course it supports Bluetooth, and plays nice with my car's SYNC feature, as well as my various Bluetooth headsets.<br/><br/>I can't recall how much space was available out of the box (and I didn't write it down), but I have all my regular apps loaded (including a few large games), as well as upgrades to the Google Apps, and the system upgrade to 4.4.2 that was pushed to me shortly after powering on, and I still have 5.83GB available in Internal storage. This is because this phone DOES play nice with 64GB microSD/SDHC/SDXC cards, and I've got all my data, music, pictures, videos, and other media on the SD card. It also let me make the SD card the default write disk, which means most of my large games were loaded onto the SD card and not the Internal storage. Several of the ones that didn't go straight to SD card still allowed me to move them to the SD card after installing. This is a GREAT feature! It can't be understated that a nice phone with poor storage space management is not worth the effort, and in this regard BLU comes out way ahead of some competitors.<br/><br/>The Back, Menu, and Home buttons are soft/capacitive buttons, not physical buttons. They're not on the screen itself, but underneath it. The work well, but it's taking me some getting-used-to because the Back is on the far left, and the Menu is on the far right, and that's the opposite of the way the BLU Studio Mini LTE was designed.<br/><br/>I run Nova Launcher instead of the stock launcher, and it runs smooth as silk. I did have problems with MX Player Pro, though. It completely froze the phone. I ditched it and went with VLC for Android, and everything's fine again. My favorite SMS program, Textra, doesn't seem to want to work all the time with this phone, but Messaging, Hangouts, and Messenger all work. [EDIT: I re-installed Textra and entered in custom APN info into the app, and now it works perfectly].<br/><br/>The phone comes with a screen protector. Sadly, it's not pre-installed. The Mini LTE had one installed from the manufacturer, which saved me a headache (putting on these things is a delicate, maddening exercise if you're a perfectionist that can't stand even one little speck of dust under it!) but it was still appreciated that one was included. It also comes with a clear silicone case that fits rather tightly. It seems to make the buttons a little more sensitive, but I've learned to work with it. Also included is a decent set of earbuds (better than most pack-ins, but not exactly high-end, either), an AC adapter brick, and a USB cord. I think more manufacturers should include a basic case and a free screen protector! This is a nice touch from BLU.<br/><br/>Using this phone one-handed isn't for the small people out there. I'm not small, and even my hands struggle to do things one-handed with this phone. However, I still wouldn't trade it for the smaller phone. The screen is gorgeous, with a great viewing range. Angry Birds 2 looks terrific on this phone, and my HD videos streamed from Plex look gorgeous.<br/><br/>As I stated previously, mine had Android 4.4.0 out of the box, and upgraded to 4.4.2 within a few hours of being powered on. I haven't noticed any significant difference between the two versions of KitKat. It runs smoothly and hasn't given me any trouble thus far.<br/><br/>In fact, my biggest complaint is that my phone holder in my car was no longer able to handle the job. This phone's too long to fit one way, but not wide enough to fit the other. I had to dig out a different style of phone holder to mount it properly.<br/><br/>This is a big, beautiful, lots-of-bang-for-the-buck phone. I adore it. Five stars.<br/><br/>UPDATE 8/16/2015 -- So this past weekend they pushed the newest update for this phone to Android 5.0.2 Lolipop. The update adds a few new apps from BLU-- Most notably Blu Help, which takes you to a support site, and Opera browser which replaces the stock web browser app from the previous OS. The phone is definitely capable of running Lolipop smoothly-- even with my preferred launcher running instead of the stock launcher-- and gives a few extra features including a new lock screen and battery management. I also noticed that the Data connection seems more stable than it did with the previous OS, and best of all, it doesn't screw up the ability to store apps on SD card. It is, however, a LONG update. It took me the better part of 45 minutes for it to complete from the time I started the download (via fast WiFi) to the time it rebooted into the Lolipop. If you do it, make sure you have a full battery and some time on your hands.<br/><br/>With this update, I can't really add stars since I already rated this five stars anyway, so I'll just say it doesn't drop the rating at all. It maintains the high quality I expect from BLU after some experience with their products. I'd happily recommend this phone to anyone looking for a 6" unlocked device that runs Lolipop.<br/><br/>UPDATE 12/15 -- I've gotten a new Sony Xperia C5, and as a result I'm dropping the BLU Studio 6.0 HD rating to 4 stars. Yes, it's a great phone and I love it, but it's showing its age and lower-tier functions now compared to newer phones. Granted, there's no comparison price-wise, so I'm leaving this at four stars to reflect that *for the price* this is an excellent phone, but when compared to a higher-end phone it begins to show some weakness. Only a little, but that's why I'm only docking one star.<br/><br/>It's still the best bang for the buck, I think. It's just an older choice that may begin to lag behind in specs soon.
THIS PHONE IS HUGE!<br/><br/>I was looking for a larger phone as I have large hands and carpal tunnel syndrome.  I wanted something that fit comfortably in my hands, that I would be less likely to fat-finger on, that would be easier on my eyes, and that would have better internal storage than my old phone (MetroPCS' version of the Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G).<br/><br/>Once I got this phone in, I was blown away by the size (same size as an iPhone 6+) and quality.  The screen is bright and vivid, maybe not quite as good as some of the high-end phones, but for $150 I am impressed.  It came with vanilla Android 4.2, but it upgraded automatically to 4.4 (Kit Kat) upon initial setup.<br/><br/>The 3,000 mah battery lasts me a full day of pretty heavy use - I have my work and personal emails synched to the phone, and I have it connected to my desk phone at work via Bluetooth during the day, plus I do quite a bit of social media (Facebook, Reddit, etc).  If I had a complaint about the battery, it would be that it's a non-replaceable built-in battery.<br/><br/>The 8GB of internal storage is light compared to the Apples and Samsungs of the world, but for a light user like me I have more than enough storage for all of my apps and content.  I've also got a 16GB microSD card, so I have what amounts to a ton of storage by my standards.<br/><br/>The phone is faster than my old cheap Samsung, looks prettier, and has none of the Samsung or MetroPCS bloatware.  The dual-sim is nice to have, although I may never use it; but if I ever needed to get a separate line for work, I would just add a SIM to the phone and be done with it.<br/><br/>Call quality is okay, although the phone is so large that it took some practice to get the speaker lined up with my ear.  The speakerphone feature is clear, but can be quiet at times, as can the sound on Youtube videos and such (even with headphones).  The phone comes with a set of earbuds, which aren't my cup of tea (I prefer on-ear headphones), but they sound pretty decent, have a mic for use in hands-free calls, and they're FREE.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a high-end, top-of-the line smartphone or phablet, this is probably not for you.  If you're into trendy, this is probably not for you.  But if you're looking for a decently powerful, solidly-built smartphone for casual use, and you don't want to go broke in the process, pony up for this phone.  You won't regret it.<br/><br/>P.S. -- I bought the Armor Flex case for an additional $6 or so, and it's definitely nice to have, but the phone does come with a silicone skin for protection.
Not being a hipster or a techie, I believe this would be considered a "phablet." It's pretty fabulous too! I don't have an iPhone 6 or a Samsung Galaxy  s[insert large number here], but I have no complaints about the screen quality, photo quality or the responsiveness of the screen. Okay, maybe a bit about the photo because my friend's iPhone photos look fantastic, but then I think that has more to do with their techniques and filters.<br/><br/>What's in the box:<br/>- Phone<br/>- Screen protector<br/>- Back cover which is supposed to be like a case.<br/>- USB-to-microUSB cord.<br/>- Charger block to plug in the USB portion of the cord.<br/>- Earbuds with extra covers.<br/>- Manual booklet in 3 languages: Portuguese, Spanish and English.<br/><br/>This does not come with an external microSD card, so you have to purchase your own for additional storage.<br/><br/>I'm going to write down what's written on the box. Some of these might be meaningful to you while useless for others:<br/>- GSM Quad Band<br/>- 4G HSPA+ 21Mbps, HSUPA 5.76Mbps<br/>- Quad-Core 1.3 GHz CPU<br/>- 6.0" HD [720 x 1280] Display<br/>- BLU's Infinite View [IPS] + Nex-Lens [OGS]<br/>- Premium Material and Finishing with SLim 8.5mm Design<br/>- 8.0MP, LED flash + 2.0MP Frontal<br/>- HD 1080pVideo Recording @30fps<br/>- 1GB RAM + Expandable MicroSD Slot [Up to 32GB]<br/>- Android KitKat v4.4<br/><br/>(Note: Amazon's product description says MicroSD up to 64GB, but the phone's box says otherwise.)<br/>(Another note, just to stress: the camera's flash is only on the back 8.0MP side.)<br/><br/>You can have two regular-sized SIM cards. I only use one and need only one phone line, but having two could be really cool, especially if you travel. I have an earlier BLU phone which had some minor glitches, but this one doesn't seem to show any. The only problem I noticed was how the Google Play Store wouldn't pull up any searches for apps without the official icon showing up. I don't know if this is a Google Play issue, Android issue or the phone itself.<br/><br/>I often use only one hand to use the phone more like a computer. Unfortunately, if the phone is largish, the fleshy area beneath the thumb often interferes. This one does too, but because it's so big, I don't see how one-handed browsing is possible, unless you have humongous hands - for reference, I can reach a 10th on a piano.<br/><br/>The toughest part of getting started was opening the back cover which you just sort of pry or snap off. No fancy sliding mechanism. It's kind of frightening in a way because I feel like I might snap something. Sliding in the SIM card was a bit tough. Unless I'm missing something, I just jammed it in there. Putting on the screen protector is always challenging. I screwed it up a bit, but at least I was able to readjust three times very, very carefully. Put the screen on immediately after removing the screen film so you don't have to bother with cleaning cloth.<br/><br/>Oh, the phone works fine on a T-Mobile service, if you're prone to use your phone to call someone. The one-star deduction is because it has a built-in battery. Maybe because I don't upgrade my phone every year or two years, all my phones lose battery holding power, so I like to replace only the battery to get few more years out of it. If I ever need to replace the battery, I'd have to hack it which voids the warranty, but then the phone (hopefully) would be out of warranty by then because I expect the battery to last for at least 3 years. I also want a true, sturdy case which provides more protection because the way the included case (basically a back cover) is used, I can see the entire back panel falling off if the phone is dropped. Well, I suppose the built-in battery will at least stay in there, so there's THAT benefit.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very affordable, well-working phablet.<br/><br/>****************************<br/>UPDATE ON AUGUST 13th, 2015:<br/><br/>The phone still works well. Some quirks and failures:<br/>- Once you put the protective back cover/case on, the microUSB connector to the phone doesn't stay on. You either have to pry off the top portion of the cover or make the hole on the cover larger by cutting it carefully if you have the skills and the guts.<br/>- After the phone's been on for a while, the keyboard doesn't type or respond well on the Chrome browser. After rebooting, the keyboard works fine.<br/>- The Play Store works fine. I don't know if there was a bug on the Play Store's part or user error.<br/>- It's very difficult to take a screenshot. I've done it a few times using the usual Android tricks but can't seem to do it consistently.<br/>- Android tip: Remember how the middle home button displays all the apps you have open? Now, that middle button brings up Google search. To display all the apps you have open, hold down the "settings" button at the right of the home button. Voila!
Update 4/11/14:<br/><br/>I am loving this phone after using it for a while.  I really love the size.  At first, it took a little getting used to, but now I absolutely love the 6" screen and don't think I will ever go back to a smaller phone.  I look at my spouse's 5" phone and have to squint.<br/><br/>I have only come across two issues:<br/>1. The usb charging cord doesn't work any longer.  I have in no way abused the cable since it has been sitting nicely on my desk the whole time connected to my computer.  The plug that connects to the phone has come loose.  I have replaced the cable with a mini-usb cable I already have and it charges fine again.<br/><br/>2. It is very easy for me to hold down the power button when I am holding the phone during conversations.  There is just something about the way that my hand wants to grip the phone that I am constantly losing calls because the phone resets when the power button is held down long enough.  As time goes on, I am becoming more and more aware of how I hold the phone and to be careful, but there has been a learning curve about where to hold the phone properly.<br/><br/>Original review:<br/><br/>First, for the price, I don't think you can get a much better deal at the moment.  The phone is not perfect, but the feature set to price ratio is pretty good.  I've been on this phone non-stop for 5 days before writing this review.  There are a lot of video reviews available, which cover all of the details - so, here are my personal impressions:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>*Good build quality (it's heavy, but because it packs a 6" screen)<br/>*Good battery life (I get almost a full day)<br/>*Excellent, large screen<br/>*Fits well in average to large hands<br/>*Standard Android without bloatware<br/>*Charger connects to top of phone (love this feature; it's unlike most phones where the charger connects to the bottom of the phone; very useful for using phone while charging)<br/><br/>Average:<br/>*Processor speed: it's fast enough to get most things done, but probably not the best device if you want to play processor-intensive apps/games (Update 3/8/15: I haven't experienced any lags, as I see some other reviewers mentioned)<br/>*Silicone case is so-so; nothing to brag about but gets the job done until I find something better<br/>*Call quality isn't the greatest; volume at maximum is just OK in average noise settings (i.e. a supermarket)<br/>*Touch-sensitivity (it's good, but not as good as more expensive devices)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>*Needs better touch sensitive-buttons below the screen;  I still miss hit the buttons and have to press several times for response, even after 5 days of practice<br/>*Built-in speaker quality is not above average<br/>*Cameras (These are not iPhone quality cameras.  No matter what I do, I can't get clear pictures despite the ok megapixels.  Seems that it may be a software/hardware issue.)<br/><br/>I truly believe that the pros outweigh the cons for the current asking price. You'll be hard pressed to find a 6" device with this feature-set for less.  I think you will be mostly pleased if you mostly use this device for the Internet and tasks that are not processor-intensive.  It's strongest suits are not actual voice calls, but who talks on the phone anymore anyway!  As for any other cons, the cameras are probably the biggest disappointment.  Although I thought that the 6" device would be generally too large, I really do love the size.
I had to get this phone in a crunch and I wasn't about to spend $600 for an overrated Facebook machine. Coming from an iPhone it was a little different software wise. Being that it's stock Android I just downloaded a good home launcher. The camera is a little weird and glary, but I'm using Camera 360 and now pics come out perfectly. Although the battery compacity is fairly large it was dying fast but now it's lasting a good day and half.  This phone kind of replaced my iPhone and iPad due to the screen size. I'm having fun with it and it works perfectly for my business.  I totally recommend!<br/><br/>Update: Now going down to 3 stars. At this point I'm only using this device a music player for my stereo system. I came across a whole lot of crazy bugs and glitches, and I had to switch back to my iPhone 5s for my business needs. I would recommend this as a teen phone at most. Definitely not for power using.
I really thought I would love this phone because I had a Note Edge and other Samsung phones so I'm use to having big phones. However the only thing this stupid phone has to offer is the size. It is a HUGE phone, but the proccessor is slow. You have to press the key over and over just to navigate it. I would not suggest this phone to anyone. Please save your money and spend it on a better phone!
I've had the Studio 6.0 HD for 4 months and I really enjoyed using it.. while it lasted. The phone is actually a pretty nice phone. The worst part about this phone is the screen. It is without a doubt the most fragile screen I have seen. I bought this phone when there were hardly any cases made for it, which left it pretty vulnerable. So naturally, as humans are want to do, it was dropped. The screen developed only a minor crack on the to right. But the touch sensor stopped working all together. Well I blamed myself for not being able to find a case. No biggie... just send it in for a paid replacement. Well, not a week later, the screen was pressed too hard by accident. BOOM it cracks again and is once again useless. I am sorely disappointed in the quality of BLU's smartphones, especially since I enjoyed using it so much. I will not be purchasing anymore devices from this company if their other products are as flimsy as this one.
It's exactly what I expected (which is good), but still suffers from the defining characteristic of this kind of device---<br/><br/>You can't turn a phone into a tablet.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>-Beautiful, bright screen. The PPI isn't as high as other high-end phones, but the 1280 x 720 (720p) screen looks good. Very good, even. There's some minor (very minor) darkening distortion along the top edge, but it's almost never noticeable.<br/><br/>-Fast and responsive. Apps and navigating are breeze on this thing. Compared to my old Acer Iconia A200 (more on that below), this is no comparison. Sure, you'd like to have 2 GB of RAM instead of 1, and the 4 GB on-board storage is frankly a little weak, but overall, the hardware has more than enough juice.<br/><br/>-NO BLOATWARE. Comes with a bare bones, stock install of Android KitKat 4.4.2, which is GREAT.<br/><br/>-This is a BEAUTIFUL device for e-reading.<br/><br/>-Battery life is excellent for a screen this big. You'll easily get 7-10 hours of hard use on a single charge. On days with only minor use, you can easily go 72 hours between charges (granted, by the end of day 3 I'm under 10% remaining, but still........)<br/><br/>The Cons:<br/><br/>-As stated, you can't turn a phone into a tablet, even when you (and the manufacturer) really, really want to.<br/><br/>This is a "phablet," pure and simple. Granted, it's still small enough to fit into a typical front pocket in a pair of jeans, but it's still a large mobile device. I'm tall with big hands, and I'm usually fine using it with one hand as a phone, but for anything else two hands is needed.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy using this phone. The overall experience is great, the problem is the Blu Studio 6 is both too big, and not big enough at the same time.<br/><br/>A little background----<br/><br/>My wife goes through about a phone every 2 years. She drops them, cracks the screen, etc. This past year she got her upgrade. But I was using an old Android 2.2 phone, and an aging Android 4.0 Acer Iconia tablet for my portable tech.<br/><br/>Well, during an exercise run on the treadmill, I ended up knocking the tablet off and cracking the screen. Kaput. So at that point I had the choice---do I get a new tablet, or kill two birds with one stone and get a "phablet?"<br/><br/>One of the reasons I'd gotten a tablet in the first place was to read PDFs. The problem was my old Iconia A200 was just too....dang.....slow to render PDFs of any size or complexity.<br/><br/>But I also really wanted a new phone. I looked at and considered the Galaxy S5, Galaxy Mega, Huawei Ascend Mate2, and the Blu Studio 6.<br/><br/>I was **THIS** close to purchasing the Ascend Mate2, until my wife wandered by and said, "For that price, you can get BOTH the Blu Studio 6, AND a Kindle Fire. So why not do that instead?"<br/><br/>So I went ahead and ordered the Blu Studio 6, thinking that maybe, just maybe it would do the job on its own and I wouldn't have to even order the separate tablet. Sadly, as cool as the Studio 6 is (and truly, it is a very, very cool phone), it's juuuuuuust not quite big enough to surf the web and read PDFs clearly like it would be on a 9 or 10 inch tablet . . . . yet it's too large to be a really comfortable as a phone.<br/><br/>A great device, stuck in no man's land.<br/><br/>If you don't care about reading PDFs, this phone jumps up to at least 4.5 stars.<br/><br/>That said, surfing the Web feels . . . . strange somehow. On a small screen, you just accept the fact that you have to workaround the device limitations. This phone feels like you should get a more "full bodied" Web surfing experience, but the size limitations are just enough to make you yearn for an extra 1.5-2 inches of screen real estate.<br/><br/>Granted, surfing pages is fast and responsive, but the screen real estate just isn't quite there to really make it a treat.<br/><br/>Hopefully if nothing else, I've helped someone else out there decide if this is the right device for them.
I've owned and used Android phones since Froyo 2.2. LG Optimus, Samsung Galaxy Nexus to my last phone a Google Nexus 5 which I've offered to my wife. I'm tech savvy build my own computers since the 80's. I did my homework.. Blu Phones and Media Tek processors both have a sound reputations (I recently read Google just contracted with Mediatek for the Google One phone) and besides "any" current day quad-core processor will likely perform just fine for most people including gamers unless you need bragging rights or brand recognition. The Mediatek Mt6582 processor runs Dungeon Hunter 4 without a hic-up. Antutu 5 runs at 17K+ hardly a poor score for users with reasonable expectations. If you know Android .. buy the phone. If you don't you could end up creating problems that will result in lack luster performance and glitches and ultimately bad mouthing a more than capable phone. The OS is basically a plain vanilla 4.4.2 KitKat (a good thing) with a few tweaks ..  One notable issue I encountered: a problem with nesting apps. After a reset I gave up on that front and just use the main apps menu.. a small adjustment. I've observed no other shortcomings. Its fast, Wifi works as expected, phone signal strength is very good, with a strong tower signal 3g+ runs Speedtest at 10+gps with AT&T; Straight Talk) Bluetooth pairs properly every time, Playstore works as expected,  the 6 inch display quite respectable. Coming from the Nexus 5 took a day or two to adjust to the phone's overall size (I'm 6 foot 185 lbs) but now it's not an issue. The phone fits in my levi's back pocket without difficulty and the provided silicon case is more than adequate unless you cannot hold on to you phones. If you're like me and craving a larger display buy it ...  and save your money while you wait until the next gen phones come out with 64bit processors that can actually utilize Lolipop. I came close to purchasing a Nexus 6 but the phone was out of stock when attempting to buy it the first day .. now I'm happy that it was out of stock. This phone is working just fine as an interim phone for me.. I will likely be fine for you also!
good morning,<br/><br/>Amazon,<br/><br/>I bought two phones BLU Studio 6.0 HD Smartphone - Unlocked on 01.31.2015, one of the phones arrive defective, not eschucha not reproduce volume or videos, or music, or calls.<br/><br/>Twice call Amazon in Spanish, q inform me they can not help me q window warranted for 30 days, I was closed.<br/><br/>My trouble is that I have a new phone defective, and it is not right.<br/><br/>This ocaciona a bit of disappointment and mistrust to continue shopping.<br/><br/>sorry for the inconvenience,<br/><br/>Waiting for an answer,<br/><br/>I say goodbye,
I've had this phone for 8 months. Its not the best but it will get the job done.  The screen is very large and clear. Its easy to use. Back camera is nice, front camera isn't that we'll unless you're in good lightening. It works well with simple mobile. It has outstanding battery life so you won't need to take your charger everywhere you go. The phone did freeze often & the battery isn't removable so you'll have to wait until it unfroze which I hated. The phone came with a case, headphones, screen protector,  & charger also. Last but not least, DO NOT drop the phone too many times with out the case on it or it will SHATTER because mine did and I was not able to use it again. But all in all, it was a great phone it lasted me 8 months. Now I'm waiting on my new Blu 7.0 :)
Ok, so I have used this phone now for a little over a month before I did my review so I could be fair about it. Let me start off by saying, the fact that the phone is unlocked, has a big HD screen, and is on a decent android os, its a good phone (the phone will come with a rubberized case and a screen protector which is another plus!). There are some things that I thought this phone wasn't able to do and it took lots of digging and messing with the phone to get answers. 1 example being screen shots. I thought for the longest that you could not do screen shots, only later finding that if you hold VOLUME DOWN + POWER BUTTON at the same time, it will in fact take a screen shot. Also the battery. Battery life is GREAT! I was a little iffy about the battery being a permanent fixture to the phone, because sometimes things happen, phones freeze (would just like the option to remove the battery if need be). After receiving the phone i found that the battery is not permanent per say. It can be removed but is covered even when removing the back plate. HOWEVER, if you tamper with the covered battery, warranty is void. On to the screen, its bright, its big, going off looks its definitely not disappointing.  I did find that the screen was SOMETIMES unresponsive to my touch (comparing to my Samsung devices I had previously owned). Nevertheless, it was smooth when transitioning screens and pages. The charging port. This to me was an odd thing, the charging port is located at the top of the phone. I did find it useful when riding in the vehicle and using GPS or things of that nature, but for browsing at home or having to answer a call while charging, just kind of awkward. Another thing to keep in mind is the fact that there are no physical buttons on the front of this phone, and learning the placement of the touch keys are somewhat different compared to other android devices. Would i recommend this phone...depends. If you are looking to upgrade from lets say, a galaxy note (1), (dual core) S3, POSSIBLY note 2. Sure, this is a decent phone and is placed decently high on the quadrant standard. But if you get this phone thinking it is going to be above and beyond a leading android phone, dont hold your hopes high. Having had the Note 2 before this phone, I would much rather have my note 2, BUT I needed an unlocked phone and paying for a new note 2 that is unlocked was just not a sensible thing for me to do. I am happy with this phone, it does have some neat features and seems to take anything I am able to throw at it.
When the phone arrived, was fantastic. For 4 weeks. Then it began having issues with the screen. There were stripes visible from time to time. Not often enough to deem it useless, but it was annoying. Unfortunately, the insurance purchased with the item said this was a manufacturers issue to be covered under warranty, and the manufacturer said it was insurance. I am sure than most of these phones come off the line without a glitch, and I can attest to the speed and quality of the phone at first. But I don't know if dealing with the red tape makes it worth the risk.  The price was great until we ended up having to buy another phone.
Awesome deal... Amazing pictures and color. APN settings preloaded for Net10, Walmart family mobile, metro pcs, T-Mobile, two Spanish providers which basically means no more messing with settings to get your phone to call, browse, send and receive messages or SMS messages. No more contacting the company and tech support to figure it out. Play store wouldn't work until update was done but after update runs beautifully. Can't beat the cost for the huge 6" screen and great graphics. Con has built in battery so it can't be replaced when battery starts to lose power...  at least without voiding warranty
Very nice phone. Wife has had it for 6 months works perfectly. Using it with Straight Talk on AT&T; network. Near stock android Love it! Fast phone. Newest update fixed all bugs. Camera isn't the greatest but the screen is very nice. Speakers could be just a tad louder but it will fill a room with music. Speakerphone could be a tad better. Overall highly recommend this phone. For the price it blows everything away and very nice quality. A++
I bought and used this phone for three months to help cope with my Presbyopia.  It charges fast, lasts long comparing to my previous Moto X (1st Gen) with similar performance.  It just received Lollipop update over the air, took almost 30 minutes (this might be due to the 180+ Apps to be optimized by Android 5) and it is even better.  Not easy to find a fancy case, the included one is very basic but works fine.
Please resend me another cable!
The phone will not charge unless it is TURNED off.  This problem just started of course after the warranty and I was referred around and around making telephone calls to get it fixed. Updates will make the screen Blue with and freezes. BLU customer service is not helpful at all and short with you. Not pleased at all!!! Do not buy this phone
Look reality check people, this is not a flagship phone so complaining about it not having the fastest speeds or best camera or otherwise is futile and just takes away from a proper review and assessment of the device. Here is what you are going to get, solid specs for mid range device, very comparable to a Moto G 2014(2nd gen) with a larger screen. The hardware itself is good, usable and more than does the job for the price paid.<br/><br/>Now to clear up some of the issues and complaints I am seeing which are in my opinion because of lack of knowledge of Android and software and wrongly placing blame. I have been using Android and developing the software since 2009, so lets get to those issues.<br/><br/>With the upgrade to Android 5.0 - 5.1.1 (Lollipop) you will notice issue that are beyond the control of Blu and the hardware itself. For example Android 5.X has memory leaks and processing issues that are in the main source code, these issues cause battery drain, over heating, and false registering of battery percentage. What often occurs is the device gives the hot/over heat warning because the processes do not stop. Best way to avoid this issue is regularly/daily clear the cache by going to (settings > storage > and clicking on cached data) You will be prompted with a pop up to clear it, click yes. Secondly, you should be doing daily reboots/restarting your phone. This also clears up lag issues. As for the battery issues of phone not showing charge or arriving and not turning on. This is common with devices in storage for prolonged periods of time. Place the device on the charger and allow it to charge for at least 30 - 45 minutes. From there press and hold the power button for about 15 seconds or so, 9 times out of 10 the device kicks on and acts normally. You should however not use or remove the device from the charger until it is fully charged at least for the first time you charge it. This helps Android calibrate the 0% - 100% levels. Lastly, the device only has 8gb storage and much of that is used by the system and apps. You will notice lag and reduced performance the more you store on internal memory. You really should purchase an SD card and store your media ie: movies, music, photos, on the SD and not internal storage. This again will help maintain performance...<br/><br/>All in all Blu is a really good product for the money, but if you are new to Android, how it functions, and what can been done, you should be asking questions on forums and other sites as most of the reported issues are readily resolved without the need for customer service, returns, or loosing sleep.
Based on day 1 experience, I give this phone a 5 star rating. This is purely because I feel the balance of price and quality (so far) leave me delighted. The phone feels good in the hand.<br/><br/>The screen is large and jaw dropping, just as a 6" phone should be and especially when upgrading from a 4.5" device. The resolution isn't the best out there, and when I look closely I think I can notice it. And lets be fair here, I really have to focus in on pixels to notice, and if I did that all the time I'd go blind! Colours seem fine too, vivid enough.<br/><br/>What impressed me most was just how easy it is to type on this larger device. The keyboard is spaced out just that little bit more and I really notice the difference. It's a pleasure to work with.<br/><br/>It comes with Kitkat 4.4 which is awesome (I really dislike Android 5 presently). You will need to run some updates out of the box so you've got the latest Gmail, Chrome and other apps.<br/><br/>The SIM card slots are those big honking ones that were from phones 3-4 years ago, so don't expect your current SIM to fit straight in.<br/><br/>Speed is okay. Its similar to my Nexus 4, maybe a tiny fraction slower, but the Nexus 4 moved along nicely for my needs.<br/><br/>The micro USB charging slotdoesn't quite have that satisfying "click" that makes you feel like you are properly connected and charging... at least not on the first cable I used. The second one was fine.<br/><br/>End of day one, I'm thrilled, but nervous. I feel like I just got a $500 phone for $150, but paranoid I will discover the reason why this phone was so cheap in the next day or two. *touch wood*<br/><br/>Day 3 update:<br/><br/>1. the micro USB charging "issue" I had turned out to be due to the cable I was using, so we can put that down to user error.<br/>2. Quadrant score was 7228 (my Nexus 4 scored 6932).<br/>3. once fully charged, I got 1 day and 10 hours of good usage out of it before I got 15% battery left warning.<br/>4. I have notice some screen sensitivity issues. I occasionally need to press the screen twice and feel something of a "blind spot" in part of the screen. Its occasional, not irritating yet, but something to monitor.<br/><br/>General feeling after 3 days... still thrilled.<br/><br/>Week 2:<br/><br/>So I've now been using this wonderful device for two weeks, and I am still thrilled with it. The battery life is great, as you would expect from a 3000mAh. The call quality seems on par with my old Nexus. The screen sensitivity issue I noticed is real, and does take a little getting used to. It is not by any means frustrating or disruptive, but it does take a fraction of a second longer to notice a press. The CPU is pleasantly fast, but not mind blowing. I find the scrolling of web pages slightly jumpy for initial view, but then comes good, so I suspect its an internal caching issue or something to do with Kitkat. I've had two minor updates from BLU as well, so it looks like they are actively maintain the product. Lastly, for the nerds out there, I install a SSH client on the phone and the larger screen and keyboard mean that I can now perform highly technical tasks using Telnet while I'm on the road without needing my laptop. Granted, typing for long periods of time will be a pain, but for me, I am really appreciating the phablet form factor and getting a great sense of money.<br/><br/>General feeling after 2 weeks: happy as a dog with two tails! :)<br/><br/>Monday update:<br/>I went 2.5 days on a single charge over the weekend, with regular use. Still happy!<br/><br/>Two months later:<br/><br/>Android 5 update has been pushed out by BLU for this device.<br/>There is a minor issue with touch screen sensitivity. Occasionally the screen doesn't recognise the finger and the Google "swipe" keyboard gets what I'm swiping completely wrong. It's rare enough not to bother me, but common enough to report.<br/>Occasionally when I go to call someone, and press the number icon to enter a phone number, the keyboard does not come up. It seems to correct itself after about 30 seconds, but that is annoying.<br/>No major issues to report.
This is a great phone if you are going oversea and do not want to take your expensive iPhone 6 plus with you. Or you have a small phone and want something bigger without taking a second mortgage of your house. Or you just simply want a small tablet. I won't review Android Kit Kat here, I defer it to other more qualified users. I can only talk about how I used the device as a phone/camera/video plaback device.<br/><br/>First thing I saw that is negative about this phone is its speaker. It is very weak, it is actually impractical to carry on a call on speaker phone. The phone volume itself is not that great either, most time I have to use a headset to get clearer voice. The other party seems to hear me just fine as I heard no complaints. Camera's performance is marginal, slow, but produce decent pictures. I used it to shoot pictures of my dish in a restaurant, and they all came out soft. Only outside with brightlight that I got some decent shots. Video is almost always bad, this phone needs very brightlight and can only do a good job in non-fast moving scenes. I shot a lion dance in Chinatown and the video is almost unusable, blurry with bad audio.<br/><br/>Touch screen is faily responsive. No worse or better than other inexpensive Android phones, but not at iPhone level. Kit Kat is good to use, you would like it if you are used to Android operating system. I added a 64GB Sandisk MicroSD card and loaded some videos. As a media playback device, it is pretty decent. As I said, this could be your small tablet.<br/><br/>But for the price, you can expect too much. Since it can support dual SIMs, it is great for those oversea trip as well. I think it is a good back up to have; but as a primary phone, spend a little more and get a better phone.
Great budget phone. You need to understand what you are buying with BLU. This is not a phone to do heavy gaming or even moderate multitasking. This is not a phone to have great speaker or responsive touchscreen. This is not a phone if you have any ambition to use it as a camera. What it is, is very budget friendly tweener phablet, as they call a combo phone/tablet. It has big bright screen with good resolution.<br/><br/>Display exhibits some heavy polarization and is not very responsive to touch. It's OK, but comparing to any modern smartphone, the display does take extra effort to navigate and some light touches are not recognized. The phone also is very long thanks to extended areas to the top and bottom of display. As the result, it won't fit into any regular pockets - protruding a good inch or two even in jeans.<br/><br/>The speaker is at the bottom rear and this is a typical position for cheap phones as it allows to use surface of the table as sound amplifier. But when you hold it in hand, sound comes out weak and muddy. It's good enough for some aggressive game soundtracks, but lacks clarity as a speakerphone or when watching movies.<br/><br/>WiFi is a b/g/n and I suspect dual band as this phone has some of the strongest WiFi antennas I have seen in phones or even tablets. My iPad Air has weaker antenna then this Blu. But the phone completely lacks 5GHz antenna, so any WiFi networks on that bandwidth are ignored.<br/><br/>Cellular modem has a very wide selection of  frequencies that satisfy most 2G/3G GSM networks (AT&T; and T-Mobile in US and most of the operators outside Japan). 4G network frequencies are also present, but only for International market. So some of the high speed T-Mobile 4G networks that operate on 1700/2100 MHz are missing. T-Mobile based providers would still allow to provide speed in excess of 3G if you happen to be in territory where T-Mobile has HSPA+ bands.<br/><br/>Since the phone comes unlocked, it is very friendly to switch between any GSM-based provider. I use it with PTel, which has the cheapest Pay-As-You-Go plan in US (5cents per minute and 10cents per MB of air traffic with no monthly payment). This Blu phone is perfect for plans like this where you don't talk on the phone much and mostly use it on Wi-Fi and only need occasional network usage outside of Wi-Fi areas. It also works great as a spare phone or emergency phone that you can put in a car and only use it when your primary phone is not available.<br/><br/>Speaking of emergencies, thanks to the huge size, this phone has space for an amazingly big 3000MAh battery. Most phones come with 2000MAh batteries, so you already come with 50% more charge, and then, since this phone uses older, less powerful CPU, has no LTE power-hungry antennas or juice seeping 1080P screens, it can last amazing 10 days in stand-by mode before requiring recharging.<br/><br/>Another feature that is rare in US, but very common elsewhere, is dual SIM card capability. Essentially, it allows you to have to phone numbers from two different providers and switch back and forth depending on either coverage or ability to save money on calls. In many European countries people pay per-minute of air time and many providers give you free airtime if used within network (call from one mobile to another on the same provider). This way having two SIMs from two different providers that cover majority of all offerings, you can have an essentially free airtime by jumping from one provider to another depending on who you are calling.<br/><br/>BLU comes with KitKat 4.4.2 Android. This is one version behind the latest Lollipop (5.0) and is the most popular Android version right now. Do not buy this phone hoping that BLU would upgrade it to Lollipop. Most probably they won't as this is 2014 model and BLU has recently released 2015 models where they will concentrate support. What I like about this phone's Android, is that it comes mostly without any bloatware and very close to the Google reference Android with some very helpful improvements. The biggest of them is full support of Micro SD cards (up to 64GB) with phone allowing to use card as true extension of measly internal 8GB memory. If you know Google new Android versions, this capability was taken away and most Android phones from  large providers like Samsung or Motorola come with either no memory card slot or a castrated version where you can not do anything with this memory outside of very limited use cases. BLU has modified 4.4.2 Android to have full usage of extended memory and automatically moves apps and any data (camera pictures, music, movies, etc.) to the memory card. I have verified that 64GB Class 10 Micro SDXC card is supported and greatly expands phone capabilities. Don't forget to buy a card with your phone as without it you will run into internal memory limitations very quickly.<br/><br/>The camera on this phone sucks. There is no way to sweeten it. It is very slow to focus (up to 1sec to take a picture from the time you press button), many pictures come either as out of focus or very soft, struggling to perform any zooming or cropping. Video camera  is slow to refocus, resulting in breaks in the video when subject quickly moves and camera can not keep up. The front camera is measly 2MP and is only marginally usable in perfect lighting. Forget Skyping on this phone if you want your picture to come out like not a piece of crap. So the camera is usable for landscape photography in full daylight and not much else. I was trying to take pictures of my dog and they all came bad as he was moving and camera would not focus well or take a shot when he was already out of frame. Taking pictures of kids, pets, sprt games would just not work. Taking an occasional shot of an amazing sunset over ocean or some beautiful flower would look great but soft when zooming.<br/><br/>Bluetooth antenna is pretty strong and supports latest 4.0 Low energy mode. It's great to pair this phone with sport band or smart watch and has excellent signal when pairing with Bluetooth speakers. I can stream music to my speaker from 10 yards and two walls in between without issues.<br/><br/>BLU has very (and I mean VERY) modest specs, coming with old 1.2Gh quad-core CPU and 1Gb of RAM. Don't fool yourself with quad-core spec - it won't be able to multitask as memory is a bottleneck and any serious multitasking would result in phone hanging and requiring a hard reset. But if your ambitions are modest and you only need phone to chat/check Email/do light Web browsing or casual gaming, it would work great for you. Just remember - do not buy this phone for your kids if they are into gaming or heavy use of the phone. They will quickly push this phone past it's limitations and will be hugely dissapointed when it would not keep up with their demands and lock up on them multiple times per day.<br/><br/>Buy this phone if you want to use it instead of tablet and are OK with size when you need to carry it around. Buy it if you don't want to pay up to $1,000 for something that will break after first drop on the pavement or if you don't want to be locked into expensive multi-year cell plan from large providers. Buy it if you only call occasionally and don't plan to use it as a conference phone for hours and hours on speakerphone. Buy is if you need a spare phone that you don't plan to use heavily or take pictures with. Buy it for your older relatives who need large fonts on large screen and only have modest expectations to begin with.
Update:<br/>This is like the free razor.  I got this one free and now I've purchased 3 more Blu Cell phones. Obviously I'm really impressed.<br/><br/>I bought a Samsung S3 Mini a few months ago and I sold it immediately after receiving this one. This Blu Studio cell phone is a little bigger than I would prefer, but at least I'm glad my fingers fit the keyboard letter spacing so much better than the smaller Samsung S3 did. The dimensions are 6.75 X 3.5 inches (actually 3.375 inches if you want to be exact). On the Samsung cell phone, I must have missed the keys at least half the time and spent most of my time correcting my messages. With this one I just turn it sideways and compose my messages with ease.<br/><br/>The main downside for me is the photo image quality.  The photos on the display appear washed out or faded in appearance. I haven't downloaded the photos into my desktop computer yet.  It may be that the images are okay and it is just the display on the phone isn't so good. But that's of minor concern to me even though I initially deducted one-third of a star for the image quality.<br/><br/>Reception signal strength and overall 4G speed are nothing short of excellent. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0" Phablet (Cell phone + tablet in one) and this Blu Smart Phone seems to be faster. I have Wal-Mart's T-Mobile Family Plan on the Samsung Note 8.0 and Consumer Cellular on this Blu Smart Phone. Inside my home with both phones side by side, this Blu Phone has 4 bars while the Samsung shows only 2 bars signal strength. The transmitting tower for both service providers is straight across the lake in a line of sight distance of under three miles. Of course, both have full signal outside.<br/><br/>I had to set up the Access Point Name (APN) on this Blu Smart Phone to be able to access the internet using Consumer Cellular. This phone is unlocked, but it may not be set up for your cellular service. It came with AT&T; as the default carrier. Everything worked except I could not access the internet. I had to do some research to learn how change it to work with Consumer Cellular. It doesn't take long after you realize what the problem is and how to fix it. In fact, this cell phones still indicates I'm using AT&T; even though I'm actually using Consumer Cellular. You can search how to do this on Google. I made a comment on my own review below, so look at what I wrote there.  I didn't see a lot of choices of cellular service. I think you will have to add the other APN Carriers to get internet service. Initially I deducted another one-third of a star for the limited standard selections.  Here are the defaults that come standard on the phone:<br/><br/>AT&T;, Straight Talk, Net10 and AT&T; GoPhone.<br/><br/>You have to pop off the back cover to access the memory chip. It has two SIM card slots - one for GSM and one for either CDMA or GSM. I travel internationally to the Philippines and China, so I hope this is unlocked internationally, too. Some phones are unlocked only for the United States and not Internationally. I think this one is unlocked internationally because it showed an update in Chinese characters.  I was apprehensive about downloading something written in Chinese, but I did it and nothing bad happened.<br/><br/>The battery is built into the cell phone - not removable.  It has a big warning sticker saying warranty void if removed. So I hope this has a really good battery long term. There are a lot of screws under the back cover and it appears one must remove all of them to get to the battery.  And I'm not even sure the battery can be replaced. I really prefer to be able to replace the battery if needed.  So there goes at least another one-third of a star I thought about deducting.
I've had this phone for 3-4 months now, which I bought for $169 from a known chain retailer. Physically, the HD 6 is a beautiful phone, and it feels solid. No creaks, no bending, and it feels good in your hand even though it is a very large phone.  Sadly these are the only pros about this phone and now I have to write about the many cons:<br/><br/>- Screen started to develop bright spots near the bottom and left lower corner. I've seen other cheaply made phones with the same problem, and I'm not talking about light bleed, but probably a problem with the adhesive used for the LCD (ASUS had the same issue with some of their tablets)<br/><br/>- Phone call quality is atrocious. Most of the time I have to press the phone firmly against my ear to be able to hear a thing. The volume is so low that it makes it impossible to have a conversation.<br/><br/>- Sound quality is equally horrible. I've tried several types of headphones/earphones, and the distortion is horrendous. If you need a phone to listen to music, look elswhere. I've tried PowerAmp and half a dozen other music apps to no avaiI, this is he worst sounding phone I have ever had. In comparison I  have an LG L70, which is a super low-end phone and it packs quite a punch when compared to the HD 6.<br/><br/>-Camera is mediocre and most of the shots come out with lots of noise. Unless you're outdoors with plenty of sun you're not gonna get a decent shot. If you're trying to take closeup shots using macro or use a banking app to deposit checks,  this is not the phone for you.  Every single shot comes up blurred and it can never focus properly. The camera is completely useless with QR scanner apps, too so beware if you intend on using any of those<br/><br/>-Performance is so so. in terms of games, I've had nothing but crashes with most of the stuff I've tried, from Skyforce to Smash Hit, it constantly reboots itself. It chokes easily if you have a few apps open and more often than not there's a noticeable lag when opening certain apps.<br/><br/>I bought this phone after seeing the 4 star rating, but I should've researched a little better, cause most of the reviews concentrate on the screen size, etc and not on the actual performance of the phone. With all these problems, I can't recommend the Studio HD 6 to anyone, except those that want to flash some eye candy and are ok with its many shortcomings.
I love this phone. I switched from virgin mobile to cricket. I was paying $90 a month for 2 phones. But now, I am only paying $70 a month for 2 phones. I even get better 4g coverage. The phone is nice & light. When fully charged, the battery can last all day. The screen is nice and bigger than a note 4. The back camera is really nice too. This phone, for a $165 is a steal. I would recommend this phone to anybody who wants to save money. Bluetooth works great too.
I've had this phone for about a month now and I must say, I'm impressed.  I use both sim slots, one for T-Mobile (which doesn't work so well) and Straighttalk, which is excellent.  I took the 4G/LTE sim card out of my Nexus 5 and installed it in this phone along with a straighttalk card.  The T-mobile card is 4G/LTE but only does 2G in this phone but the straightalk card does 4G.  No problem, I just set the straighttalk card to be the default data card and use the T-mobile card for incoming calls to the T-mobile phone number.  I  bought this phone primarily for its ability to act as a phablet and it excels at that.  I installed a 32g card and downloaded some documents and spreadsheets I sometimes have to reference and show to to other people and with its large screen its easy to read.  There are many data editing programs available to download from the google store and they all work well.  The screen protector was useless, way too many bubbles and its not like I'd never put one on before.  I've never taken any pictures nor am I likely to so I can't comment on the camera.  I would suggest you download the app apps2sd and move as many as you can to the SD card (assuming you install one) to free up space, they run just fine from there.  All in all, when you compare it to the other large screen phones and take into account the hundreds of dollars less in cost, it can't be beat. Just remember, memory is adequate but not enough to run memory intensive apps, like games, and installed storage is very low so you shouldn't buy it unless you're going to buy and install an SD card.
I love this phone. Why spend $800.00 for a iphone when you can spend 90% less and get a phone that looks great and works great. I think I will buy blu phones for all of my children when it comes time to purchase their phones. I highly recommend this item.
Just as good as any current brand name high end smartphone, but one fourth the price! It's an oddity among the crowd at work with their boring iphones and galaxies. The huge screen is very vibrant and great for reading. It's been very good to me
I have had my blu for two weeks now... Made a call this morning and no one can hear me my speakers have stopped working... Help please .... Would not recommend
So far so good. Absolutely love it great size excellent display. A great quality phone for the price. Does what I need it to do. I would recommend this phone.
Phone is plagued with all sorts of reliability issues. I purchased 2 BLU phones, This one for my wife and a 5.5 inch for myself and they both have very similar issues. They restart by themselves at random, half the time it wont let you hang up at the end of a conversation or it wont let answer an incoming phone call. Sometimes the screen goes dark and I can't get it to light up again unless I restart the damn thing and Icons disappear from the home screen at random. Now one of them doesn't even recognize the micro SD card any more and the other decided to erase all of the pictures and videos I had on the 32GB SD card. Oh and battery life is terrible, we have to charge them repeatedly throughout the day and they are not that old, less than a year and they started having problems about a month after I purchased them.<br/>My advice spend the extra $50 to $100 and get yourself something more reliable like an LG or a Samsung
The reception on this phone is very bad. The voice comes over very garbled. Stay away. Not sure if I got a dud, but I cannot recomend it.
Kind of disappointed ordered a brand new phone and ended up getting a refurbished one and the keyboard doesn't even work it's not cool..
I bought this phone and received it January 2, 2015, the first thing I noticed was the instructions were very limited on why there is two SIM card slots? As well as the Volume was Extremely Low and there was no clarity on how to make it louder! Once I got home with it the adapter slides right out the socket! By the 5th day of having this phone it would not charge at all and it started cuttingvitself on/off continuously! So, I called Amazon to inform this of this issue. Prior to doing All of this I called Blu and they had me do a Factory Reset on the phone that did Nothing to change the volume. The reason I chose this phone is because I saw someone with and it seem to be a good phone as well as the fact it doesn't cost as much as the Galaxy 5s or iPhone 6. I do intend to repurchase a Blu phone but the 5.5, because I did notice that the headset hearing part of the phone is at tip and not on the side like the other models. I love the clearness and color of this phone, however it seems they either sent me a Refurbished phone, Defective phone or the Manufacture just threw this phone together and put it on the market. It's just sad this phone ONLY made it 5 days. I suggest that when purchasing Anything from Amazon make sure its NEW.
Love the look and the feel of it. Screen is nice and big, but disappointed with lag, was not expecting this since it has a nice quad core chip set. Also the buttons not very responsive, sometimes had to press them 3 or 4 times then realized that some screen protectors make it even worse. This makes no sense to me. I am disappointed, because i have owned 9 blu phones up to this point and love them. They have great prices and decent quality, so maybe this one is a dud as i have found happens a lot with Blu since their phones are made in China. This is common with Chinese phones. Always a glitch somewhere. I would suggest going with one of the more high end Blu phones like the Pure life XL or hopefully the studio 6.0 LTE is a little faster and better built then the 6.0 HD. Too bad for 6.0 HD.
I love these Blu phones!  They're really good!  This one is 4G (not LTE) but it is still very fast out in the bush where there's no WiFi.  I was in downtown Jacksonville looking for some information online and I got it and downloaded it very quickly.  I love the big size.  It's not wider it's longer.  It fits my hand OK and I can almost do one handed texting.  The screen is really clear but I don't understand screen resolution anyway so I can't comment on it technically other than to say all the edges and lines look really sharp and clear.  The screen colors are excellent.  It comes with Android 5.01 which is quite up to date.  I love the phone and would NEVER pay $600 to $800 for an iPhone.  I got Cricket (ATT) as a carrier and I get 5 gigs of 4G data for $45/month including tax.
I researched this phone, watched videos, and really wanted to love this device. I had just bought and returned the blu studio 7.0 (horrible) and thought Ok I will try this one. While the screen is beautiful, the feel of it is amazing, I had this phone all of 20 minutes, I had just put my sim card in, I had sent a few text messages, and the whole time I was sitting on my bed (so no damage) when I went to unlock the screen to check a text it froze and would not unfreeze. I power cycled and hard rebooted about 20 times, its almost like the touch screen just stopped working. Seeing as this was 2nd blu device i will not ever buy another blu device. Again I really wanted to love this phone but when you cant even use it out of the box I have to say based on what I received, BUYER BEWARE!
To start off. I purchased two of these blu studio 6.0 hd phones. one for me and one for the wife. We had them for a month now and the work great I have had no issues with the sound quality that others are saying about it. They came with headphones and my pair was no good .hers worked fine but II care about the headphones I care about the phone working and boy it works great and fast lost of memory also you can add a sd card for more storage a full battery will last me all day and only takes 4 hours to fully charge also came with lollipop 5.0 installed out the box if your looking for a great priced smartphone with hd and 6 inch screen you just found it can't forget it takes very nice pictures . I really can fine anything bad about this phone
I have used for a year now. If you are looking just for screen size, then this is a good phone. Otherwise it has a few glitches:<br/>1. The volume and power buttons position are such that you might end up pushing the two together. It goes into android boot menu - to make it worse, it is chinese!<br/>2. If you are a traveller, airplane mode does not allow wifi!<br/>3. Video recording using the camera leads to very low recorded volume - practically zero unless you scream close to its mic at the bottom of the device<br/>4. If you are a traveller again, the timezone changes to reflect in the phone is tedious. do multiple airplane mode on/off with "network provided datetime and timezone" selected. if you are lucky it will work
I have mix feelings about this phone.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>- Screen is bright.<br/>- Price is great.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>- Screen not sensitive enough. I often have to tap 2 or 3 times. I am using the screen protector but I always use screen protector and never have this problem. Is there a setting?<br/>- Battery is average<br/>- Case included is ok but the charge port hole needs to be bigger. I have to enlarge it using my x-acto knife to ensure charging.<br/>- Need better case but none exist yet<br/><br/>Problem<br/>- GPS is not that good. Sometime it will lost GPS or 20+ meters off target. I use GPS a lot so this might be a problem for me.  Maybe its Google map... I dont know. I am testing it some more.<br/><br/>3.5 Stars
Wonderful phone...... sleek and very nice!  great size.  Very happy with my purchase.  Highly recommend it to others.
It great, I love it. I love how long the battery last. It's like watching TV on a flat screen. The HD is great.
This is my second Studio 6.0 in the last 90 days. The first one ran beautify. I had no problems setting it up for use. The materials used in it's production were better that I thought. Overall I'm very pleased with this product. I would like to urge anyone who buys this phone to get insurance for it as drops or water damage are not covered by BLU. My first phone missed my back pocket and hit the linoleum floor shattering the screen in quite a few places. I was using the phone case that came with the phone. So I had to buy another Studio 6.0. I found a few replacement screens for the phone, but they were just a little cheaper than a new phone. When the prices come down I will repair and then I will have a very nice looking paperweight until I need it. Enjoy this product, I did. Keep your eye out for a hybrid cell phone case. This should prevent you from going through what I did. There are not very many cases available now that are worth using. Hoping for new cases very soon.
Volume is almost too low to hear your calls even when turned up to the max.  Sometimes a voicemail will show it is from a contact of mine but be from someone I don't even know.  The phone sometimes accidentally dials people and I can't hang up so the call wont stop ringing. (THIS NEVER HAPPENED ON ANY OF MY OTHER PHONES) Very odd phone, I don't like the icons either. The icons are strange and don't really make sense.  Voicemail is kind of weird too.  I am used to a Samsung.  When I drop the phone and crack the screen back to Samsung.
Phone is okay. Built is as good as other samsung you see in the market. Expect some lagging due to hardware limitation. Camera is not too bad. Video is not too bad. What i mean by not too bad is you can upload it on social media and people won't notice it as a bad quality picture/video. Battery life : with active use will fully deplete in less than one day. Display : Good enough( it looks good but not superb). Overall, this phone is as good as other plastic back samsung phones. Don't let the brand fools you
this phone really exceeded my expectation the screen is huge and the battery life superb unlike the Samsung Galaxy my friends have, i don't have to walk with my charger anymore because it gives me more than a day of life. i don't have freezing problem like the other phones i had in the passed, overall this phone feels like a million dollars and whenever there's a newer version than the Blu Studio 6.0 HD i will be upgrading as well once the capability is good just like this.... great product...
Bought this phone to replace my HTC One S. Phone has nice screen size if you like larger phones. I haven't had any issues with the phone after a month of use. I have T-Mobile and the phone works great with it, this phone gets a better signal and I haven't had a dropped call like I constantly did with my HTC. Graphics with games and pictures is good, but the camera is not that great. Its a good phone to buy if you want a larger screen and don't want to spend $400 -$600 on a high end phone.
"The item arrived 5 days later I bought it on December 30 and it was to Puerto Rico so that is a good time. Received an email from Amazon and then I go to pick up the package. The phones is fast and easy to set up. I have purchased the 8G one. So it has almost 6g left for applications. The battery have enough life just remember to close apps pressing the button with three little squares like in tablets but holding for a few seconds and the you close all running apps.The design of this phone is unbelievable. When you have it in your hand you can think in other thing than the word quality. The camera takes pretty good pictures and the software is easy to use."
I bought this phone 5 months ago. Never dropped it and the phone was well taken car of. About a month ago for no reason at all the phone just stopped reading the sim card. No cell phone service at all. Naturally I contacted amazon who contacted the seller and they basically said I couldn't  send it back because the return period expired. Now I am out of 154 dollars, and have to buy another phone. Those of you that think you are getting a good price on this phone, don't believe the hype. I will never again buy another blu product. Be smart and spend a little more on a samsung. The companies that sell these will not stand behind this product.
Excelent cellphone !!!! Works excellent with Movistar in venezuela....
Great phone, love the size, ideal for work or personal related stuff.
Very disappointed with open group wireless. I opened my phone to be unsealed, in airplane mode, and with someone's information on there. Not only that I didn't get the screen protector or the the case it comes with. The phone works really well no problems with it at all. Also all the stuff it did come with was thrown in there. It wasn't wrapped, it was tangled up. Other than that yeah buy this phone from a different place!!!<br/><br/>Update 9/17/15<br/>So I've had this phone since February andbit has been a delight. I've even rooted it!!<br/><br/>The battery is doing good, the camera and back panel not so much after dropping it ALOT OF TIMES!!<br/><br/>other than that I would definitely recommend this phone for being unlocked and more  dependable than my zte which I bought from my carrier!!
I like it, but I received a defective one. Returned without problem.
The documentation for this device is lacking, however, the phone is very intuitive. Having the larger screen is so much easier on the eyes, but this phone is definitely something you'll not be putting in your back pocket, or shirt pocket, for that matter. The battery life isn't anything out of the ordinary, probably average. The phone itself works very well. For the price, you'll be hard pressed to find a better deal.
2 days use. Earphones and charger are top notch accesories. The phone is sleek, white shiny  plastic and chrome edges. Works awesome so far.  My wifes had a studio 5.5 and it works awesone too. And i recomend the blu armor flex PC+silicone case. Only test left is time. My friend saw when i unboxed and she thought it was a samsung. Ive had samsung lg n moto. This quality and performance is very comlarable
Using with AT&T; Gophone service and I like this a bunch more than my Samsung S3/S4's.  Fast, great screen and KitKat.<br/><br/>Why would someone pay $600 for a Samsung unlocked when for $160 you get this delivered to your door and ready for two SIMs?<br/><br/>The charger issues some mentioned (the micro-usb included is "longer" than most, so it's tough to use generic cords to connect to it).
Nice phone, but completely failed after 6 months.  I have to return to Blu for repair/replacement.  So that is a big hassle.<br/>On the plus side, the phone was good while it lasted.  I'll update this review after I see how quickly they process my RMA<br/><br/>Edit:  BLU sent me a replacement phone that was DOA.  Customer service is giving me the runaround and won't replace it thus far.  Really dissatisfied
I cannot review the entire phone due to time constraints.  However, having owned two previous Blu Products, the 6.0 HD lacks an adequate speaker system.  At its loudest, it is very difficult to hear.  The speaker is set to the top rear, which makes hearing difficult.  Given everything, it is an OK product, but I would not recommend or buy again.  I am sold on BLU, just not this phone.
HD? Nope. Gorilla Glass? Not a chance. Phone broke while loosely in my pocket alone after sitting on a bench. Customer service is a joke. One rep tells you one thing and the next day it's a completely different story. Now me and my wife are out of phones because BLU won't take responsibility for their faulty devices. DO NOT BUY ANY OF THEIR PRODUCTS! YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!!!
Love it , its a decent size and does what I want it to do
I am giving it 2 stats because the cost of this phone is only about a quarter of a iphon6 plus or a Samsung note4.  however, the features and battery life is about the same too...a quarter!<br/>My biggest complain is the battery...it will only last for about 20 minutes if you decide to watch a video or play games on it.  I would give it 1 star, but the 2nd star is for trying and the cheap price.  If anyone is thinking of replacing your current phone with this one...don't, you will regrat it.
i like it but i like the blu studio 5.5 better because 1)there are no protective covers for this phone, only wallet type covers which i absolutely hate 2) didn't need a memory card in the 5.5 but definitely need one in the 6.0<br/><br/>dont get white because the silicone cover that comes with it gets dirty too fast and looks ugly....i made the mistake of getting white .<br/>waiting for Blu to get back to me as to whether or not they will send me a black silicone cover
Loved the phone at first, but now the screen doesn't recognize my fingers on the right side of the screen (1/4") so the letter "p" can only lot be accessed by rotating the phone when texting... Or the backspace button... Or anything on that side! Frustrating! And I am the days outside the return window, so I am SOL.
This phone is OK. But for this phone to be so big, it really doesn't do much. The volume is not all that great.  You can only hear good with headphones.  I haven't been able to receive picture messages since it updated. I think I would have been better off with something else.
1st impressions review; I've only had it for a week. I bought it USED here on amazon, under $100 including shipping. Came with a generic charger and nothing else. Obviously the first thing i noticed is the LARGE size of this phone, it is a big phone. I have owned 3 other big phones like this in the past, which means i can compare it. Ok so it felt really big, thin and slippery when I grabbed it after first opening it. I dropped it 2 times immediately, no damage resulted from the drops, about a 3 foot drop to a carpeted floor. The screen color and resolution looks nice, the speed of the CPU/system is fairly impressive, the reception is good, at least as good or better than the Samsung Note that I had before. I am using t-mobile as my carrier, the sim card slots are the bigger size, both of mine are anyway. The speaker is a little bit low quite as people have been saying, but not the worst I have ever heard. The speaker will crackle a bit at max volume, so 2nd from the most or 3rd from the most is best (for speaker when talking on the normal phone). On the speakerphone; well so far I think it probably is not a very good speakerphone, sorry to say. It is useable, but you may find yourself either shouting or straining to hear if it is in a noisy environment. Wifi signal is strong; stronger than my other phones and tablets/PC's by at least a bar most of the time. Bluetooth is working well paring it with the car it worked good for listening to music over Bluetooth in the car. Play store it works good I have downloaded quite a few apps and games to it, nothing really high end so far because I'm not into the heavy gaming. Facebook works good on it. Cameras are good. The touchscreen is medium quality as far as the sensitivity, it is not real sensitive i find myself touching twice but it's because I 'm only using the corner of my finger tip, I'm used to smaller phones. When I use more of my finger it works just fine, it's a good screen. Wifi seems fast enough. I really like this phone, I will update this if i have any problems.<br/><br/>Week 2 updates!!---Well I dropped the phone a 3rd time, this time on concrete floor from about 3 feet, sitting on a deck chair at a friend's house. No damage whatsoever to any part of the phone! I don't see not even a small chip or nick on the silver fake metal bezel from the drop. No screen damage either (which is the most important part obviously :). Reception bars meter: it lies sometimes, like it forgets to keep track like it doesn't check/poll as often as it should, shows a stronger singal than it really has sometimes. The actual signal seems on par with most phones though. I still rate it as average on reception of the phone radios. Also the battery meter is the other flukey part of the phone. Long story short is ROOT the phone, then install a battery calibration app and calibrate the battery. I just did it and it takes a while to drain the bttery and recahrge to see how it worked. The battery lasts a long time on this phone.<br/><br/>Viewing angles are pretty good on the screen indoors! This thing has a really nice screen for the price of the phone :) You got to love that big 6" screen and vivid color :)<br/><br/>I would rate it a 3.5 but halve stars are not allowed, so i gave it a 4.
This phone works just like any expensive smart android phones out there but with a big BUT:<br/>1. Its touch screen is not as super sensitive which means I have to poke the screen hard to open an app or type a message. This frustrates me.<br/>2. The screen freezes on a regular basis and I have to reboot or power off and on the phone frequently to "un-freeze" it.<br/>3. It gets hot and just drain the battery even I leave it idle and not in use. Although this has happened only six times or so for the past six months I owned this phone, still, it is annoying and frustrating to have a dead phone when you most need it.<br/>4. I constantly check the phone's time zone is correctly set to mountain time (I live in Denver, CO) so my time is correct. For some reason it would switch to eastern time on it's own. This happens when I talk on the phone longer than 30 mins. One time I put it on speaker mode when I was on it and really saw the screen switching on its own to date & time setting display from my phone contact photo display while it was on the calling mode. It was weird. On two occasions I failed to check the time zone and I got screwed up with the local time.<br/>5. For the past six months that I have been using this, it notified me of wireless update and I was able to do the updates completely twice. The third time it notified me of wireless update and I clicked "update", it gave me a message "sorry lost or no connection" even when my wireless signal is full bar and my wifi connection was strong and it got a 100% battery. So I was not really able to do the latest update. This "sorry lost or no connection" message has been happening 3 times now every time it notifies me of wireless update and when I attempted to do the update.<br/>6. This phone is now acting crazy which drives me nuts. There are times that apps are just popping up after one another even if I did not click on them. I swear! And this is a frequent occurrence. For example this has happened for real: I would click on the FB app to check my fb and it would open up and then suddenly my yahoo mail is opening up on top my fb (which I did not click on it at all), followed by my gmail inbox, pandora and the fitbit apps and then freeze. And I'm like, what the hell I did not do that! Ugh, very frustrating!<br/>7. The first thing I said about this phone is that the touch screen is not as super sensitive like the expensive phones (to be specific, I compared it to my old samsung note 3 which was stolen) which frustrates me endlessly. On opposite to that, the back of the phone however is overly sensitive because before I put my phone down, it is always in the "home screen" mode but every time, I say, every time I put my phone down, it switches to the apps screen or whatever screen it opens up to once the back of the phone touches a surface when I put it down. So at times when I put my phone in my pocket or purse I would not be aware that an app is running which also cause hotness and drains the battery eventually.<br/><br/>All in all, I would say that the way the phone is acting, it is not reliable to me. I needed a phone that functions well and I can rely with it at all times. I guess it's time for me to get a new reliable phone.<br/><br/>REVIEW UPDATE<br/><br/>So today, a week or so after I put my first review above, I received a notification of a "wireless update" (please refer to #5 above which was a problem I had with this phone before) which I pushed my phone to have the update by clicking "Retry" twice. Then this phone eventually was able to have the "latest" wireless update. The update took a while, about 30 - 50 mins or so. When the update was done, it had a new designed homescreen which by the way I liked. But the problem is, I lost my wireless network connection! Every thing was cool after the update except it will not get a wireless network connection so my phone was in emergency mode. I did some trouble-shooting by rebooting; taking off and putting back the sim card; turning off my wifi and totally powered off the phone and turning it on again. It did not work!. I had to call my mobile provider and asked their help in figuring out what's going on with my phone. Although they don't support the device (they are not using  any BLU devices) they were helpful and tried to trouble-shoot too by resetting my sim card and what not. Now the phone would not read any sim card I put in it. It would say "NO SIM CARD --EMERGENCY CALLS ONLY" which is full of BS!!! Now I can't totally use this phone anymore. My advice to BLU phone users, IGNORE any wireless update notification. Although the phone was already crappy before the last update at least it was working. I thought the update will make it better that's why I did it, now it renders the phone useless!!!
My 14 year old daughter bought this phone with her baby sitting job and now I'm jealous.  I have been using Android phones since they first hit the market and have been through my many phones and even rooted and romed then for a few years so I know a bit about how these phones work.<br/><br/>After having the phone for 2 weeks now I can say that for less $150 this turned out to be a great phone.  All my daughter uses it for is texting, twitter, Instagram and all the normal teenage social media stuff but I sat down with the phone and after playing with it a bit am considering changing out my dated Galaxy S3 for a Blu Studio 6 LTE.  The pone shipped with 4.4.2 with a possibility of Lollipop in the near furure (not holding my breath though).<br/><br/>Out of the box we applied the free screen guard and free silicone cover packages with all their phones and unwrapped the headphones which were also free.  Other larger company's should take note as a company selling budget phones are giving away accessories that don't really cost that much to show they care about the customer and not just their bottom line.  She also purchased a folio type case for it that works well but most of the time the Studio 6 HD wears the case it came with.<br/><br/>Using the phone is as you would expect and we have had no issues as of yet (fingers crossed and knocking on wood) and I have seen no lag in using the phone's applications or features.  I can not say much for the Touchwiz Launcher it shiped with as I always install and use Apex Launcher on all my devices as it's very customizable.  I thought that with the Quad-Core 1.3GHz Mediatek MT6582 and only 1GB of ram the phone would be sluggish but i'm happy to say it's not.  Many times when I would borrow the phone from my daughter she would have about 6 or 7 apps already open and I would have no issue opening and running additional apps with no hesitation or delay nor would I see any lag when using multiple apps at one.<br/><br/>I for one use my Galaxy S3 primarily to watch Videos and even though the Studio 6 HD does not have a Super AMOLED screen like the S3 BLU choose to install a IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen I can not see any difference in picture between the devices.  Both phones have similar resolutions of 720 x 1280 pixels with the Galaxy S3 running 306 ppi (Pixels per inch) and the Studio 6 HD at 245 but I and everyone else I have asked could not see any real difference.  The colors are vivid and the blacks are black and with the  inch screen I find it more pleasurable to watch programs on the daughters phone then on my S3.<br/><br/>The only reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5 is the slowness of the phone data when not on Wifi.  We are running a Walmart Family Mobile sim card and after inserting it the phone found and auto selected the APN for Walmart Family.  The reason for the last star is because the phone will not allow me to add, save and then select a new T-Mobile APN (T-Mobile provides service for Walmart Family Mobile) for better internet.  I have tried many, many times to set up the fast 4G T-Mobile APN but after saving it and going back to the screen to chosse the APN only the original Walmart APN is listed.  Due to this I have speeds similar to something between 2g and 3G.  What's weird is that my Galaxy is running the exact same Walmart APN and I get blazing speeds so I believe it's something either in the software or the hardware of the phone.<br/><br/>I know most of you are saying yeah it compares to a Galaxy S3 but that such an outdated phone; what about the newer flagship models like the Galaxy S4 or S5 or the note and to that I say I really don't know.  But to be honest if your looking for a budget no contract phone your not really looking for one to compare to the newest and great phones cell phone company's and manufacturers put out there to entice you into a new 2 year contract.  Blu products are more designed and marketed towards people like me that need a dependable phone at a decent cost without all the extra bells and whistles that only a handful of people use anyway.<br/><br/>6/1 Update - Just received the Lollipop 5.0.1 update and phone runs great.  The only issue I have found is that her last phone running 4G would show download speeds of about 20Mbps but the 6.0 HD using the same Sim card and standing in the same spot as the only phone never gets more then 1Mbps down.  I though it was her phone until I bought the same Model and have the same issue.
My old phone went through a rather unfortunate toilet “baptism” one fateful Wednesday afternoon… leaving me scrambling for a replacement before I left for vacation that Friday. Coincidentally, Amazon was running a $99 Lightning Sale on this phone that very afternoon. Even with next-day shipping, it was still less than $105… so really, how bad could it be? So I bit.<br/><br/>Then I started reading the reviews. Uh oh.<br/><br/>To hear the Amazon buying public tell it, the BLU Studio 6.0 shows up DOA, randomly speaks “Chines” [sic], and even sneaks out at night to lead neighborhood squirrels in bloody Sciuridaean revolts. The horror!<br/><br/>Still, the deed was done, and I figured that taking a bad phone on vacation couldn’t be any worse than not having a phone at all. So I spent a couple of hours on Thursday wrestling my phone number away from Boost and setting up service with T-Mobile (Boost doesn’t support GSM sim cards, which are what the BLU Studio 6.0 uses)… and hoped for the best.<br/><br/>Before I go too far here, I should point out that my standards aren’t all that high when it comes to cell phones. I wouldn’t pay $600 to see my great-grandmother water ski, much less to get the latest Samsung Galaxy… and I realize that buying at a more modest price point means putting up with a few oddities. (If you’ve ever owned a ZTE phone, you know what I mean.)<br/><br/>Now that I’ve put the phone through its paces, here are my thoughts to consider/dismiss as you will:<br/><br/>Build quality – Adequate but unimpressive. BLU seems to be going for simplicity here, and they’ve hit that on the nose. Volume rocker, power button, headphone jack, mini-USB port – that’s it. The back cover is plastic, but that’s fine with me because it helps keep the overall weight under control (sort of), and the silicone case covers it up anyway. (Plus, I’m a middle-aged guy – why would I need a diamond-encrusted platinum phone cover?)<br/><br/>My only niggle with the design is that the power button is directly opposite the volume rocker on the top third of the handset. I’ve accidentally hit both the rocker and the power button a few times while holding the phone. No big deal, just a minor annoyance.<br/><br/>Weight and feel – No doubt about it… this is not a dainty phone. At 6.4 ounces, it has some substantial heft. And, of course, the overall size is massive. It took me a bit to shake the feeling that I was going to drop the handset. Navigating one-handed is pretty much out of the question for most people. But if you’re buying a phone with a 6-inch-screen, you shouldn’t act surprised when it turns out to be huge.<br/><br/>Speed and ease of use – I admit that I was a little nervous about the 1 GB of RAM. It’s not a blazingly fast phone by any means. Still, I’ve conducted Skype calls on it without any problems, and it has handled all of the other usual tasks, including HD YouTube videos and Netflix programming, just fine.<br/><br/>The near-stock Android OS (upgraded to 4.4 shortly after I powered up the handset for the first time) helps with speed, and if you’ve ever owned an Android phone before, you’re unlikely to encounter any surprises. Again, nothing that blew me away, but nothing to complain about either.<br/><br/>Cameras – 8MP back, 2MP front. Decent enough for posting pics online and video chatting. The camera app comes with a bunch of cheesy filters, frames, and other stuff I’ll never use. The usual caveats apply – don’t expect great results in low lighting, action shots are probably going to be a bit blurry, etc.<br/><br/>Screen – This is why I chose the BLU Studio 6.0 – my eyesight is horrid, and I was tired of the whole zoom-and-scroll approach to navigating web pages. The 1280x720 resolution IPS display is adequate, and text and images are MUCH clearer than they were on my now-waterlogged ZTE Warp 4G. Plus, did I mention it’s HUGE?<br/><br/>Things that Other Reviewers are Complaining About<br/><br/>I wanted to touch on this because there are a lot of one-line, one-star reviews out there that don’t offer much in the way of details. I’m not thrilled with the idea of an integrated battery – but really, if it goes bad in a year, I won’t be heartbroken. I’m more concerned about not being able to do a “battery pull” to reset the device if it freaks out like my ZTE did on occasion. So that’s a pretty egregious design flaw.<br/><br/>I haven’t noticed overheating, low volume, random shut-downs, language barriers, homicide attempts, or any of the other things reviewers seem to be complaining about. That’s not to say there aren’t some quality control issues over at the “Chines” [sic] manufacturing plant, but everything seems to be in working order here.<br/><br/>Now, it does seem to take a long time to charge, especially if you don’t power off first. I can see how that could be a problem if you use it a lot for video viewing, Skype, or other tasks resource-taxing tasks that drain your battery quickly. I don’t (usually), so the battery lasts all day, and then I put it on the charger just before bed.<br/><br/>Wrap-Up<br/><br/>I’ve never owned a Samsung Galaxy, so I don’t know if they’re actually the “grail” of Android phones or not. Until Samsung makes one that pours my coffee and fetches me curry and samosas, I don’t really care. What I will say is that for $99 (or $140 for those who missed the Lightning Sale), it meets my needs. And having a 6-inch screen on an adequate phone at that price point is enough to make me overlook a few minor flaws.<br/><br/>***EDIT TO ADD*** Ok, so one minor gripe I didn't catch: Having the power button on the side was a dumb idea. I was at a metal concert trying to take pics in landscape mode, and I kept accidentally rebooting the phone by hitting the power button with my thumb. It's not too often that I'm trying to take pics in a sea of drunken hilljacks, though, so I can't give too much weight to that design flaw.
I've had this phone for exactly one month and yesterday I switched back to the phone I switched from for this phone. My previous phone was a Samsung Galaxy Grand and it is an unlocked phone that was marketed to Latin America and India I believe and that phone was glitchy but there was never any problems with my service, my internet connection was awesome and apps loaded quickly. From the moment I put in my SIM card the internet did not work, I was able to log into Google and everything but the PlayStore wouldn't work and neither did the browser so for days I didn't use it until I called Cricket and had them reset my connection which didn't do much good. At my sister's house in Vallejo, the PlayStore worked for the first time and then the internet was still acting weird. Then after maybe a week the internet started working but very sporadic and it would take forever to load sometimes and then other times it would work really quickly. I had a game that connects to the internet to start and it would barely work and I play this game everyday. I found that if I held the phone a certain way it would allow the game to connect but the internet was still on and off and I've only been able to open the play store probably three times and only download one thing but my husband, just two days ago was able to download a few things. Bottom line, I don't think I'll be getting another BLU phone just because it didn't work right and it's a gamble you never really know what you're getting. It's a nice big phone, easy to type on but I'm a woman with decent sized hands and it's beautiful. The fact that you CANNOT REMOVE THE BATTERY is terrible, my phone froze on me and all I could was wait, a while, for it to unfreeze and the Protector that comes with it, people said I sounded muffled which only got better when it was taken off. The camera quality isn't terrible but it's not as good as my other phone though my other phone has the same specs. The charger port is also at the top and the battery life is TERRIBLE, just terrible it goes down so fast and my husband had to install some battery saving app on there to get decent battery life and even then it's not that great but a lot better. I mean literally, within seconds of me taking the phone off of the charger after being fully charged, it was at 90% and I hadn't even done anything. UNFORTUNATELY, I have to get another unlocked phone but don't know which one in the same price range. Suggestions anyone??
I've had many phones over the years, IPhones, Samsung Galaxys, miscelaneous android devices l, windows 8 phones. I've tried the high end Lg Optimus phones and had no luck. My Samsung galaxys gave me issues, and I got tired of iPhone bugs and damages. I have had this phone less than a month and I love it better than any phone I ever had. It sounds great, it looks great, It feels great, and it works unlike any $400 phone I've ever used.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-long battery life with a full charge. Netflix doesn't drain the battery like most phones (including the galaxy)<br/>-Big screen makes watching videos, writing notes, web surfing, amazon shopping, and everything else a breeze.<br/>-Processor (phone speed) is amazing, I do a lot on my phone, I need something that won't lag or slow down, and this phone doesn't. It only slowed down one time, but I had it on a browser running a website that my high end laptop has problems running.<br/>-Service 4G doesn't even come close. I'm used to 4G LTE, and I don't see any difference in the speed. No buffering from Netflix, no slow downs when downloading apps.<br/>-Case that comes with it is thin and smooth, it's easy to hold and doesn't seem to slide out of your hand easy.<br/>-screen protector fits perfectly and doesn't peel or slide.<br/>-Glass screen unlike other BLU phones.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Big screen means big phone, it doesn't fit in many places, but my back pocket works just fine.<br/>-Touch Screen doesn't respond well to stylus pens. But its big enough at your finger works just as well.
THE PHONE IS WHAT I WANTED I LOOKED LONG TIME FOR THIS ONE IT IS GREAT NOT HAD ANY TROUBLE WITH SET UP WAS EASY LOVE THIS PHONE I GOT EVERY THING FOR IT OFF AMAZON ALL FIT THE PHONE GREAT YES I AM HAPPY HAPPY WITH IT WILL BUY ANOTHER FOR MY SON
Totally entry-level smart phone disquising itself a mid-level phone with supposedly good specs.<br/><br/>It's honestly too big, and that is of course a personal decision/opinion. However, the buttons are badly placed, not easy to find/press, and you can never tell top from bottom until you pick it up and find a button to push. It has a number of missing or poorly functioning features also, making it poor choice. Honestly. I've owned 15 Android phones and 2 Iphones. This phone has less to offer than the even the earliest Android phones.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Difficulty of use, due to size and placement of volume and on/off buttons.<br/>The screen is not responsive. Especially when typing.<br/>No brightness sensor. This is bad, You have to change the brightness manually everytime you go outdoors.<br/>Sound quality in earpiece is tinny and unnatural.<br/>External speaker volume is too low for use in almost any environment.<br/>Bluetooth connection quality is terrible both outdoors and indoors. I used on 3 devices.<br/>Older Android OS with a poor overlay. Settings difficult to change.<br/>Both sim slots are full size, but no adaptor included for mini or micro sims.<br/>No removable battery, but yet not water-resistant<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Lots of screen space<br/>Decent battery life for a big phone.<br/>Price. It's cheap.<br/>Attractive exterior<br/>SD card slot available<br/>2 Sim card slots<br/>Comes with a quality, fitted skin to protect the back
I have used the phone for almost a month and like the phone very much. Although the phone volume is kind of low, but it is good enough unless you are in a very noisy place. The size and display of the screen are very nice.<br/><br/>Update:<br/><br/>After a month of usage, I got a replacement from Amazon last December due to a minor issue on the screen. The replacement had been working fine until ten days ago, the screen started to flash. It flashed roughly once every second, all the time, as long as the screen was on. When it flashed, stripes were everywhere on the screen. I tried reboot, factory reset, etc. Nothing helped. I contacted Blu customer service. They didn't provide much help. Luckily, my phone was still returnable because I ordered the replacement during the holiday season. So, I got another replacement last week. Hopefully, this one will not frustrate me. I reduced my rating to 3 stars. If this one will work without an issue for an half year, I will add one more start to my rating.<br/><br/>I am very grateful to Amazon customer service. They are amazingly helpful.
This is the Greatest Phone!!  Am thrilled to have one this big!. So glad I got the 6". IT is truly a great picture! It's easy to HOLD ON TO also!<br/>Could not have made a better choice. I researched it for 2 weeks.
Got this phone for about a week now. Love it very vey much. Love the curvy feeling of the screen and the phone itself. The display is very pleasing. The appearing of the text on the screen is so un believably crisp. I was a little worried that I will be under power for Android 5, but it is not. It is very fast and Android 5 is much better than the 4.x. I like this phone more than the more see expensive BLU Life I bought for my wife. I think from now on my phone will be 6 six inches screen it is so much better for reading mail and web pages. Some people have complained about insensitive screen. I don't feel the problem. It may b only tiny bit less sensitive. The 8 MP camera seems plenty. My last phone is iPhone 3gs, yes it is that old...I think it is at least 6 year tht I have used it. It is still holding charges well although no apps is compatible wih it anymore.. So I hope that this phone last at least half as long. The phone feel pretty solid and the included case is beautiful (I will buy the rugged case though case I am clumsy). The included headphone is fine with me...I'm not an audiophile. I don't think the speaker is weak like others have said. The thing is the speaker is on the back, so you actually have to put it face down on the table while aving conversation. That's all for now, will update again after maybe 6 month. For $128, this phone can't be beates.
This phone has totally exceeded my expectations, and the existing reviews have covered most of the attributes quite well.  I have three hints that may make your experience better:  (1) SIM Card - This phone uses 2 standard size SIM slots.  I ordered an adapter kit along with the phone that allowed me to use my existing AT&T; GoPhone mini card.  Even though it was from a Nokia 520 Windows based phone, it worked perfectly in the transfer to the Android BLU (in SIM slot number 1), and saved a trip to the phone store.  (2) Battery life -  Although this phone has a strong battery, many apps insist on staying in a constant running mode, which can seriously deplete battery life.  I installed Battery Doctor from the Play Store, which has a feature that selectively turns off unneeded apps as you wish, and greatly extend battery life.  (3) Case issue - The semi transparent case included with the phone has a nice fit and finish, but the cutout for the USB port is too small to fully insert other charging plugs aside from the one supplied with it (that works very well by the way).  I took a small X-Acto knife to widen the slot to better fit my other chargers, and viola, it now works with all of them.  Dollar for dollar this is the finest phone of its type out there IMHO, and sacrifices very little to the high dollar alternatives.  I highly recommend.
I could write a book but I will spare you.  A critical question remains; who in their right mind pays for name brands or in this case up to $1,000 or maybe $700 when you could get a similar product for a fraction of the cost?  I know the question may seem silly but that is the question for countless  consumers.<br/><br/>This device is outstanding.  It is called a smartphone or a phablet but to prove a point I took it to my office as a colleague brags about her new iphone 6.1.  She even belted how proud she was to pay $900!!!!  Anyway, I placed the phones side by side and the BLU is just slightly larger than the iphone 6.1.  With the built in battery, which is an iphone trademark you could not tell the phones apart.  So whether you are considering a fancy iphone or a NOTE (which are great products), if you are looking for basic options or some alternatives.....BLU may be your answer.<br/><br/>My current phone is a Galaxy S5 which I picked up new approximately 3 months ago.  My carrier is T-Mobile.  I am very pleased with the device and T-Mobile's service.  My basic functions are text, some apps as well as listening to Sirius.<br/><br/>Here's the nuts and bolts of the BLU......<br/><br/>First, I had never heard of the company or phone but considering myself practical, I was looking forward to using the device.<br/><br/>SIM CARD<br/>Set up is pretty basic, however my SIM card would be read or register once I fired up the device.  I called T-Mobile and they checked compatibility and assured me everything was in order but suggested my best bet is to go to the T-Mobile store for direct assistance.<br/>After going to the store, it was discovered by SIM card was not the correct size.  I needed a larger card, BUT, for $10 they provided a larger SIM card, did their computer magic and presto gave me the phone back as it was working.  By the way, I also have a 32GB storage card due to lots of music and photos, videos, etc.  The device picked up the storage card with no issues.  Moral of this segment is be prepared to spend a few bucks to get a SIM card in the correct size.<br/><br/>The colors are very vibrant and since Android is based on the Google platform usage is a breeze.  As a matter of fact once I inserted my SIM Card all my apps and other components loaded with no issues.<br/><br/>The sound is excellent.  The phone is lightweight and the design is very trendy.  The Andriod system is a standard but very easy to learn.<br/><br/>Nice enhancements<br/>1.  The device comes with a protective cover.  On my Samsung I had to pay $35 for a case.  The fact this is part of the purchase is absolutely great.<br/>2.  A set of nice ear buds are included.<br/>3.  The power cord including USB adapter is included.<br/>4.  The packaging is very solid.<br/>5.  The manual is basic but provides enough info for you to understand what you are doing.<br/><br/>BLU has a very nice website which includes support contact and other information you will find handy.  The device comes with a nice warranty so no need to worry about getting ripped-off.<br/><br/>This is a great device for the person who is willing to step outside the box and discover the benefits of BLU, without getting hammered at checkout.<br/><br/>Final tip if you are considering this device.....<br/>1.  Do your research.<br/>2.  There are some great videos on YouTube<br/>3.  PC magazine and other tech books have some great reviews.<br/><br/>The question remains even though I am just starting to use the device, I still can't understand how customers allow themselves to go for the hype instead of the reality of a very good product at a very reasonable price?<br/><br/>Also to be fair, I will be updating this review from time to time to give a good perspective of how it functions.
I tried REALLY hard to like this phone, but in the end, it just fell short for me.  I am a power user, though, and I do MUCH more with a phone than most people will ever attempt, and this phone just couldn't keep up.  Is this a GOOD phone?  YES!  It is a VERY GOOD phone, but it just isn't a GREAT phone.<br/>1) It does have problems multitasking-- possibly due to only having 1 GB of Ram.  (It rebooted itself more than once when I attempted to do anything else while talking on the phone -- looking up contacts, open a browser, open an app, etc.)<br/>2) It's screen is beautiful, but WAY TOO big to only have 4 icon columns in the native launcher.  I tried a number of other launchers including Holo Launcher, Holo Laucher HD, Smart Launcher, Apex Launcher, and Go Launcher, among others.  I was able to make the icon grid a more acceptable 5x5 or 6x6 and reduce the icon and text size appropriately to take advantage of all this screen real estate, but all the launcers  seemed to REALLY slow down the phone, and may have actually contributed to both issue #1 and issue #3.<br/>3) The bottom right corner of the phone's touch screen (in Portrait orientation) including the menu/recent app button, was less than responsive.  Keys on the popup keyboard didn't register on the first tap.  Menu/recent app button took many taps or long tap attempts to respond. This was probably a problem with my specific phone, but it may also speak to BLU's quality control.<br/>4) There are no slim flip cases available for this phone.  I no that's not a specific problem with the phone, but it is due to the lack of this phone's popularity.  The provided screen protector and case are very good, and the screen protector was very scratch resistant, but it was impossible to apply without bubbles.  Also, there are few after-market screen protectors available for this phone, again, probably due to this phone's lack of popularity.<br/>5) Finally, there just seems to be too much bezel above and below this screen for a 2014 phone.  As a tablet, it's ok.  As a phone, its too much, and this is a phone after all.<br/><br/>I like this phone, I just don't love it, and because of it's touch screen issues and rebooting problems, I am sending it back.
This phone isn't what it seems to be, yeah it looks great but it's just a basic giant android. And the sensitivity is so low that it makes it hard for you to type or touch the screen...I'm getting a Samsung
Not a good product. I've only had the phone one month and I'm already having major problems. Freezing up, unable to answer incoming calls, screen black out, and much more. I hate that I spent my money.
I told myself I would wait a month before I wrote a review.  After 5 weeks or so, I can report my experience with the phone has been very good.  I moved my service over to T-mobile "pay as you go" and that was probably the most painful part of the process (getting T-mobile to understand what I was trying to do).  A note about T-mobile:  their website has a tool that can determine compatibility with many phones, and the one caveat with this phone is that it does 4-G and not 4-G "LTE".  This is true, but I haven't really noticed the cellular data service any slower than other 4g service I have had before.  The phone itself supports dual sims with the capability to swap between services.  I plan to use this next month while on a longer vacation in the UK (will get pay as you go service there to save on roaming costs).  The phone itself has a very nice large screen, and I enjoy the FM radio tuner (many phones have this feature).  Video playback is very smooth, and I enjoy watching videos on planes with the larger screen.  I was worried about the phone not fitting in my pocket, but it seems to fit fine without the need for one of those ridiculous-looking "holster" rigs.  Anyway, I like the phone a lot but will probably have to buy another soon for the wife :-)
Bought this for my wife, she loves it very much, I was a bit skeptical but it's a nice phone and it can compete with the other big brands. you get more than what you pay for......love it.
I received my phone last Thursday and it was ok until 2 days ago..The speakers suck and now no one can hear me if I call them or if they call me..but I can hear them just fine
Wanted to post a quick review after having this phone for almost a week.  Cons: limited support info, phone-usb recognition, screen protector had spots, mediocre ear buds, average battery life, unknown warranty  Pros: zero bloatware, dual sim awesome, surprisingly fast and responsive, nice packaging, functions and works as expected, free gel case  This phone was replacing a 1.4 year old Samsung S4 Active, and 1.3 year old IPhone 5s.  HUGE screen.  Shipped with android 4.4.2.  Of course android imported everything from my old phone almost flawlessly.  Plays videos and mp3s fine.  Has decent music interface.  Biggest beef so far is that even though almost 6 GB is free on the phone, I can't get it to be "seen" by win8.1 dell desktop.  The lack of bloatware went from 126 apps updating on samsung phone to 41 here.... that difference seems to make up for performance difference.  I wish I had been able to install the screen protector that came with it - followed instructions and even watched youtube video about it, but still had too many bubbles for me.  Time will tell on the warranty, but hopefully it will last.
bought this phone 3 months ago, worked good until then and the out of nowhere the screen shut off but the three icons on the bottom are still lit. if anyone has this same problem and has fixed it, please help me
I have had my blu for about two weeks now and I have to say : Nice large screen with crisp clean clear images. Light weight , slim design and easy to navigate. If you are somewhat smartphone savy , then getting used to this device is a breeze. If not then just take a few moments to read a little and you will be on your way to Blu world lol. This is my first Blu device and I have to say I'm sold. Love the features , position of buttons , apps that come preloaded and space available left so I can set my own phone up without a company flooding it with apps I never used. ' Awesome '!!! Fits perfect in my hand and by no means to bulky. Since my purchase I have ordered another Blu phone for my nephew. In short , great phone with hi tech features and quality at an affordable price for all, not just another hi tech phone for the rich. No punt intended. Thanks Blu for making me a new satisfied customer with quality and price. I'm would recommend this phone for all. And for the review about reset, just hold power button down a couple seconds and its done.
The blu Studio 6.0 HD has a great display size of 6" which will work great for those that like to watch videos or just want to have that ease of viewing websites and picture without pinching your screen out to get a better view, even though the BLU Studio 6.0 still has that feature as well.  Studio 6.0 respond to touch commands (accessing apps/websites/pictures ect...) at a pretty decent speed.  Has a duel Sim Card slots and micro sd port up to 32gigs.  The sound on the Studio 6.0 is not that great, so if u will be using the speaker phone or bluetooth be advised it's not the greatest when it comes to the volume.  If your looking for a phone that takes great phot's or videos the Studio 6.0 HD is not greatest if u will be using your phone as primary taking and video recording....But overall if your looking for a large display phone that does everything any other smartphone does but at a little lesser quality but at a great rate then this is the phone for you BLU Studio 6.0 HD
Love this phone!  Wanted a Samsung note 4 but didn't want to spend so much money on it found this phone and haven't had one problem. Would buy it again
I love this phone I got it delivered yesterday after patiently waiting for it in the mail I am satisfied so far I thought the phone would look like a Samsung Galaxy s5 heck no its like a note 4 so big and great my Netflix is excellent on this phone Instagram is so much bigger I like how the price is so cheap haven't tried my camera or video but so far it was so easy to connect it the sim you have to put in it was nothing im with metro PCs which is on T-Mobile network the only defect I had when you switch the phones you have to make sure the company of your carrier check and make sure it don't downgrade your service plan to the lowest plan I called it was fixed right away I was able to go to the settings and make the phone 4g only and it works like a 10g phone its super fast I just love it the case they gave looks a little cheap I haven't tried the headphones yet but more then likely I'll buy my own that I like which are apple ear phones but overall so far I give this affordable phone five stars even the speakers and volumes are loud to my liking two thumbs up blu products I'll update my statement in two weeks
My personal Assistant.  After several months of use I am starting to depend on it more and more.  Still learning all the things it can do to make my retirement time more enjoyable.  Only one con - I had to learn how to hold it and turn it on without pressing the power and volume keys at the same time.  When and if you do you will get a diagnostic program in Chinese.  I have found the best way to get out of it is to just hold the power button down until the screen goes blank, release the button and it will boot up on the welcome screen,  I need the big screen display and brightness because I have 66 year old eyes my accuracy with my fingers touching small things is not as good as it used to be.  At this stage of my life I don't need the top of the line cell phone, I don't need all of the functions they offer for the high price.  This is just what I need.  Thanks BLU.
Phone is too big, incoming sound is awful. Have to put each call on speaker, even then it's not clear, wasted the money on this one!!
The phone it was OK it has alot of generic updates and another thing I dont like is I got to use a headset to talk on the phone
I love this phone. In the past I owned varies Galaxy phones, I-Phones and Microsoft devices. I gave this a try, because of the price/size. I like this phone so much that I'm considering giving this one to my son and upgrading to the Studio 7. If you just use the phone for basic internet use/Aps, this is the most economical way to go. I thought it would lag etc., but it's fluid and has all the features I need. I wish the volume was better, but it's ok, hooking it up to my Bluetooth takes care of that issue when I wanna listen to music. The quality of my calls is also decent, I have a contract plan with T-Mobile and had no issues with getting the device started/maintained.<br/>Again, if you don't need all the features that maybe the Galaxy 6 offers, settle for this device. It looks great and has a great feel.
I purchased the BLU Studio 6.0 HD phone a couple of days ago and I love it.  I'm an AT&T; customer and I could not afford upgrading my phone as they are forcing people onto the AT&T; Next plan.  After a lot of research, I came across the BLU phones.  Most people had nothing but good to say about the phones.  The technical specs are light compared to rivals such as Samsung and HTC but I haven't had any issues.  I was amazed when I turned on the phone.  The picture is crystal clear!<br/><br/>I ordered the BLU ArmorFlex PC+silicon case for Studio 6.0 HD.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P1EAAEG?redirect=true&ref;_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_23.  It's a great case.  Looks good and fits the phone very well.<br/><br/>I have nothing but good things to say about this phone.  For the price, you can't beat it.
I loved this phone, UNTILL the speaker went out 2 weeks after having it. Very big clear bright screen, awesome camara.
<br/><br/>
I love this phone camera amazing easy to use and great battery life. I can not find any thing wrong with it 10stars
Phab price on this Phablet!  Bright screen very responsive to touch and fast, no lag at all while bouncing around this phone.  Plays games well and streams video just fine.  Do miss the LTE, but at less than $100 I can get over LTE.  Oh and mine shipped with android 5.0.  Specs are decent and overall experience is very good.  Sound on calls could be louder, but speaker volume is just fine for a phone.  Feels great in the hand.  Very big phone, I put a rugged heavy duty case on it as I am sure this screen will break very easily.<br/><br/>I am defiantly a BLU fan, can't wait to buy something from them a little higher end.  Like to see a Windows 10 phone on a 6" screen with and octacore and 3 or 4 gigs of ram and a high end camera.
I expected a cheap mid range phone for the price and instead I got an impressive machine that has done everything I've asked. The only two cons: 3.5mm headphone jack is lower quality than most, so headphones are restricted on volume level. Workaround, use Bluetooth headphones, no restrictions. Second issue is no notification lights. Workaround, download a notification light app.<br/><br/>I'm still amazed that from 5% battery, I was able to charge the phone to 100% in 15 minutes! I used the cord the phone came with. Every app has worked with the phone so far and after a quick charge, phone lasts 8 hours with HEAVY usage. Without, much longer. Seriously who cares how long it lasts when it charges in 15 minutes?
I've had this phone for about six months. Overall, it's been a decent, affordable phone, though it took me a little while to get used to an Android after using an iphone for a number of years. There's a lot to like about this phone, the most being its affordability. As for what I don't like, this phone has the tendency to lock up. This has happened on three occasions over the last few months. It won't allow me to shut it off or reboot it. And since the battery is built in, you can't do the old "take out the battery to shut it off" trick. I just have to wait for it to work out its issues, which took about a day on one occasion. This would be a keeper other than that.
I just got this phone 2 days ago. So far I have no complaints at all. It offers a system update but the phone doesn't even need it. Its perfect... I'm glad I chose this phone. I love how you can have two sim cards at once and a memory card. It has so much space. The battery is actually built in the phone, and its very nice. It charges extremely fast and I no longer have to carry my charger around with me everywhere because it stays charged all day no matter how long I stay on it. The screen is very big & clear. The phone is very fast it hasn't froze at all.  At first I had the Samsung note 3 and I can say this phone is waaaay better. I'm in love with blue now lol. No more Samsung for me! the phone also comes with a phone case, ear buds and screen protecter. I highly recommend this phone!!!!
At $140, this is gotta be one of the best bargains on large screen android phones!<br/>I have had various samsung versions.. which are nice phones but this BLU seems as nice.<br/>It comes with a clean operating system, without bloatware!<br/>It works as well as my samsung note 2 did and as well as my current samsung mega 6.3.<br/>The only reason I am not switching to this phone, from my mega, is the lack of interchangeable battery..<br/>I have used this phone, so far, only with wifi.<br/>I don't see a reason why it would be excellent for audio either.<br/>It comes with a free case - the case is as nice or nicer than what you would buy separately - soft silicone.
I love this so much! So glad I bought it, and the shipping was fast! Thank you for sending it to me
Just purchased it.  I'm an average android user. This is my 7th phone.<br/><br/>Con:<br/>  Speaker is not loud or clear enough when outdoor in public places.<br/>  Sometime when download apps, it freezes for a good second or two.<br/><br/>Pro:<br/>  8M camera is nice.<br/>  Responsiveness is .00001 second behind; however, not enough to bother. This sound like a Con; however, I've used cheap phone before. To me, this is not a bad at all.<br/>  Screen size and resolution is great for regular reading or youtubing.<br/><br/>Note:<br/>  With the recent crabby "google play service" update, this phone is working fine.<br/>  I'll also post update.<br/><br/>Overall, the phone is great buy for the price.  I'd buy this again.
Its a good phone.....for the price.<br/>When I first got the phone I was super excited, but when I turned it on...it didn't turn on! I had to charge it for about a day before it turned on. After that it kept turning on and off, restarting and resetting my phone and that was in the first couple if days. So after the the first 2 weeks of dealing with this I was sure I was going to return it. But! It just stopped having problems and since then the phone has been great!<br/>Great look and overall design<br/>Runs almost every app quickly<br/>Big screen easy to read books and doc.<br/>Supports PDFs<br/>Keyboard sensors lack but work
Sister loved this phone, one problem is not very sturdy and one drop and it cracked the screen.
I love this phone. It was a little big but that's because i didn't choose it my sister did. Anyway, this phone was great until about 6-7 months of using it the mic gave out. So i sent it back to BLU after a terrible customer service experience for a "new" one to return in a paper envelope with bubble wrap and with a screen that is not secure and shows light on the seam from the volume rockers down. I am HIGHLY unsatisfied with Blu. If you buy any of their products, please consider getting an AMAZON extended warranty. Their CS is 100 times better.<br/><br/> If I were to rate Blu's customer service alone it would get a 1 out of 5.
I am pleasantly surprised and satisfied with the BLU Studio 6.0.  This phone was purchased as a replacement for a smaller phone and a broken 7" tablet. After using for the past 3 months, the performance has been better than I anticipated for a phone of this price. The screen is responsive and doesn't lag or skip when playing movies. The camera takes acceptable photos. The dual SIM chips function as they should. The speaker when playing music/movies is decent quality (obviously not Bose speakers... but hey... it's a phone). WiFi/Bluetooth have good range.  No complaints at all. Kudos to BLU for a good phone at a great price!
Got this phone for my dad for christmas and two days later the screen went blank.....I am very disappointed!
I've had my BLU Studio 6.0 for about six months now, and I love it. The battery life is excellent, and the phone itself is rather quick and responsive. The only significant difference I've noticed between this phone and its high-priced counterparts is the camera, which isn't great on the Studio 6. Still, I would definitely strongly recommend this phone, especially at its sub-$150 price point. While other phones may "cost less" when you extend your wireless service contract, it is no small perk to be on a month-to month plan and not beholden to a given mobile carrier for years into the future.
Yes im so excited about this phone. Sorry guys i was going to send a review as soon i got it but i was having to much fun with the phone. It works awesome guys u can't beat the price & everything that comes with it. And now it just updated to 4g which im so proud of becuz its working even more powerful. Gaming, movies are awesome to watch, eceb YouTube is awesome to watch. If u want a bigger screen or phablet like phone this will get y there fully. Thanks amazon for the great prices making sure my purchase was a success and on time, love u all, can't wait to see what else i can purchase lol.
I had this phone since February 2015, It is now June 2015. First thing i wanna talk about is the size. You can't use it with one hand without risking to drop it. The second thing is that this phone is full of glitches. Battery is good, But the readings on battery life is off. It constantly freezes at time when typing, And the touch sensor is bad.  volume is low your cant hear anything at all even wen you near it, blah. Your experience will vary but this phone can use a lot of work. I mean it was cool while it last. Dropped it three times the screen cracked the third time, good luck.
November 22nd UPDATE: They pushed an update that brought the phone up to 4G (At least on my T-Mobile Network). There was a problem with the last update that caused desktop ICONS to get lost after a reboot. This has been resolved with the 11-22 Update. Also some minor updates updated. I still love the phone EXCEPT for 2 things. 1-Cases are hard to come by. The Silicon included is OK but  would love a GOOD solid belt clip and case. 2-It might just be my phone but the speaker on playing music or cell calls sucks. Now....does it accept the new 128GB MicroSD Cards? Maybe in the future...
I started using this last September 10, 2015. The first few weeks of using it, I was soo impressed and happy. The pictures were decent, (that I even opened an IG account), the screen was big enough for me to read PDF documents, look at photos etc. Fast forward to October - the videos would just stop, Facebook freezes, screen freezes, the screen is not too sensitive/won't respond for a few seconds/had to tap multiple times, then there were times when I couldn't hear the caller clearly, or they have difficulty hearing me. I still use it, cos that's what I paid for, a cheap phone. Last week it started running out of battery that I had to charge it twice a day...
The screen suddenly stopped working. I need a working phone or my money back. ASAP. It is a gift.
The Phone completely stopped working after one month.Now I am also unable to replace it too.
I have had it for about 2 months now. First off front camera is bad I thought 2mp was ok its not. Phone freezes a lot especially when im switching back and forth between apps. At first it was a great phone, but now it died and shut off and now it wont turn back on. I had it in the charger for a few hours nothing. I am stuck and I dont know what to do. It cost me $200 and it is not worth it. I have no scratches no damage nothing and now it just doesnt work anymore. Not a very good investment. Dont buy the phone.
The phone stopped working after 1 week because the battery would not charge.
the phone that I received was obviously opened and used by someone else. The phone was not sealed when I got it. I thought I would give it a try anyways. I'm assuming that this phone had been returned prior to me receiving it by another person for being faulty. The headphone jack did not work, you can barely hear anything when you use the speaker and when making or receiving calls, they sound "muffled".  Also, the phone keeps turning itself off and on. I am returning this phone for a full refund!!!!
Screen looks great. It might be "only" 720p but its bright and vibrant. Love that the Lollipop update was available at arrival. Phone speed seems pretty snappy, calls sound good, battery life is better than I expected. Phone has more a premium feel than I expected for the price, reminds me of a Galaxy S2 or S3 (in a good way!). Could not be happier, I dont think you could find a better phone in the price range. If you want a 6" screen and don't mind the lack of LTE then this is the one for you.
After reading other posts, I decided to write mine. I knew that when I bought this phone not to expect it to be an IPhone or Samsung, therefore I got what I expected, or maybe more. This phone does exactly as I expected, I haven't had any problems with it, the volume could be boosted but I can live with that for the price that I paid. Upgraded to KitKat and it seemed like a different phone completely. Would recommend this phone to anyone looking to save a few bucks and have a large format phone.
loved the phone, but started to have problems with it after 3 months. every time I plugged it in it would reboot or if I plugged my head phones in the head phone jack it would reboot. also I would store the phone in my front pocket in my pants and it would turn off. now I cant get the phone to turn back on, spent a lot of money on this phone and expected it to work more than 3 months. very dissatisfied, cant figure out who i need to contact to see if i am able to get the phone replaced.
So far so good.  Only had it a few days but it has already impressed me.
I have had my BLU studio 6 for a little over a year. I love the phone and have had no problems at all. I was a loyal iPhone customer for 7 years. But I felt their prices got outrages. I took a chance and switched droid via BLU studio 6 and have no regrets a year later. The phone has a huge display, but very light and thin. My only request to would be to make the display a tad brighter.  But aside from that I would buy this phone again as is, if I lost the one I have now.
I waited this long to write this review, because I wanted to really see and experience how the phone really works. And I have to say I'm a little impressed with the phone and have nothing bad to say about the Studio 6.0 HD. My only issue is that it doesn't have an indicator light for text messages and things like that which is an easy fix just download an application for that and problem solved. All in all it's a great product especially for the price.
I walked into the swimming pool with my 4 year old LG Thrill 3D phone and ruined the display. So I bought a BLU Studio 6 HD from amazon for less than $200. Wow, am I pleased so far. The screen is incredible, but the phone is thin. Quad core cpu is faster than heck. Lets hope it lasts as well as the LG did. Be careful with APN settings for straight talk. Most of the APN settings on Youtube DID NOT work. Go to the playstore, obviously on wifi and download the straight talk app. It worked like a charm.
the  fastest shipping,,,the phone works great!!!<br/>i love it!!!
Love the phone, just hate I can't find too many cases that I like
The overall phone is great, with an exception of a little minor issues. (not saying you would have the same experince.) The problem was, setting up my play store; whereas, I was unsuccessful in doing so.<br/>as well as, unable to receive the internet. as i stated above, you may not have the same problems if any at all. However, 9tronix is an great company to purchase from. The representative was very helpful and patience with me.
not even a month into having the phone the alarm stopped working, the audio of phone calls comes and goes i can't hear what callers are saying now my ringer doesn't work so i have to constantly look at my phone so i don't miss so many calls i have been a consumer of blu phones and accessories for some time and have been very satisfied  this is my third blu phone and maybe my last i just can't afford to have a undependable phone
Seriously,  this phone rocks! For the price you can't beat it. Good battery life,  vanilla Android, decent camera,  awesome screen.  Very smooth finish,  easy to setup. Does work with straight talk. Lags once in a great while but what do you expect, 1 gig of ram isn't for power users. Great bang for the buck phone highly recommend blu products!! Also came with a screen protector and case,  headphones and charger, awesome stuff!
This Phone is great. I just bought it and got it in two days! The screen has a beautiful resolution. Also, one big advantage is that you can write your apps on the SD card, which can go up to 32GB. The nearly stock Kitkat makes the phone speedy. One problem is that it occasionally will display nothing(black screen) so i just do a quick restart by holding the power button. However, overall it is a great phone for less than $200
I thought this phone was going to be answer to the major smart phones out there with outrageous prices. But this is a case you get what you get what you pay for.  After 36 days of use screen was distorted.  Half black and the rest of the screen scrambled.  I realize that I was not getting an iPhone here but I did expect the smart phone to last longer in 36 days. And of course Amazon will not refund or replace after 30 days.
I have had this phone for over a Month now and am VERY pleased with it.  I had the Studio 5.5 before this and decided to buy this and re-gift my 6 month old 5.5 to my Mom.  She's happy to have moved up to a 5.5 and I love the 6.0.  I have many gadgets in my house but this thing is with me everywhere and does everything.  Along with the 64gb card I put in it it serves as a mobile computing platform that I am thrilled with.
We purchased 2 of these phones. 1 of them has some minor issues. It will occasionally freeze while playing a game and I have to restart it. That's annoying. But the other phone was much worse. It would reboot itself every 5-10 minutes. Even if you were doing nothing. That phone was returned and Amazon was awesome with the return process. We are waiting for another phone to be delivered with hopefully better results.
before i bought this phone i read all the reviews and felt it was a good deal. now that i have had it for 5 weeks i hate it. it opens different screens, flickers between apps, the touch screen has bad spots and the vendor has not responded to my request to return.  I have never been as frustrated with a phone as with this one.<br/>I my opinion, this blue phone falls extremely short of a good deal.
I am impressed w/my BLU Studio 6 HD.  The video reaches out and touch you. I compare it to the LG Optimus PRO & Samsung Galaxy Note 4.  I can have slots for 2 SIM card, plus an SD card.  I probably would have given it a 5, but I still being amazed at features I didn't know I had on my BLU.  I am one person, who has shown & demo my phone to at least 10 people-- they were impressed w/my Studio 6.0 HD
Phone charger lasted two weeks picture quality is horrible
i should be giving No star for this item. The only reason why i did is due to the fast shipping and delivery. Other than that, i will never buy this brand again. Service and internet connection going in and out, standby/power button does not work, Notification lights had never worked. Those are just a few to name out of many problems i had just withing one week of using it. Don't Buy.
I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PHONE. It's a must have. 💗
I received this phone and it runs slow, the phone screen had got stuck and it takes a long time to get on the Internet. And this  It was not what I expected, I do not recommend this phone personally. This experience happened within the first thirty minutes to an hour after charging the phone.Will be sending it back. But maybe this phone has a defect but I will not be using this phone and will be sending it back.
The built in battery made it impossible to recover when the phone froze which it did alot. When the phone cuts off which it also does often it comes.back on in another language which I had to you tube to figure out how to get back into the phone. The speaker is horrible although the picture was pretty nice. A bit heavier than I anticipated.  Overall  I didn't like it much at all.
Big screen wonderful phone don't miss my Samsung at all
I had been looking at this phone for some time now and I finally said what the heck and ordered it. I am very happy to say this phone is really great. I've had it for 2 days only but I really use it a lot and so far I haven't been disappointed at all. The screen is great videos are nice to watch. I'm coming from a galaxy note and so far I deffinately recommend the blue.
Had issues with this model. This phone had problems running apps, videos and games mostly. These same apps work fine on my cheaper, smaller memory/ram phone. It'd crash and reboot. Then the mic stopped working. It would download update but couldn't install. I have to pay to ship to BLU to get the warranty service. Decided to get rid of the phone before I regret it.
The phone was purchased brand new but after installing an update it quit working and i was unable to reset the phone.  I could not return the phone because it was over 30 days since it was received.  I spent over a hundred dollars on a phone that lasted less than 2 months.  The last Blu Studio phone I had only lasted about a year and it quit holding a charge.
I usually love blu products but this 6.0 HD is severly disappointing. It shuts off and off by itself. My clock tends to turn back an hour by itself and when I try to play certain games and the screen goes black and freezes and after awhile it will turn off and come back on. Should have stuck with my 7.0 LTE. Please fix this or I'll go back to at&t; phones
This phone is amazing. For the price. It is actually unbelievable. The quad core processor provides good speed. The 6 inch display is truly HD! And the feel of it in hand is unexpectedly good, based on the screen size. The 8 mp rear camera quality. Cannot complain there! I just wish the 5 pm front camera was better. But that can be overlooked. Liking the phone so far... ALOT!
Would give 10 stars if I could...I am a firm believer in there is no quality in a name (I.E. Samsung, HTC, apple etc) and this device makes me proud to stand by that statement. If they aren't already BLU will be a tough company to beat. This device is incredible for the price and probably the best phone I have owned, I left my HTC desire 816 for this
Great phone, love the price and it works great. :)
Love this phone. Everyone loves how my screne is big. It was lots of space for my apps, this is better than the cheap T-Mobile phones. I was very shocked. Downfall is it freezes or get stuck or restart on it's on from time to time..good purchase. Love this, now I'm looking for a newer version of Blue. Camera is a little whack, the front one..
The phone crashed three days after activation. When I finally got it to work the Bluetooth drops when calls come in and the volume control gets stuck.  So I am not sure on this end what to do about that.  I liked the size of the screen and the over all functions of the device. Just some issues that I feel could be addressed better. Thank you
I was so excited about getting this phone. I like the size and all the features. It arrived just as expected in two days. I had phone for a week now. Today, all of a sudden when I went to make a call, the receiver can not hear me. I did everything told to get volume, nothing works. Looks like I will have to send phone back.....disappointed
I've had this phone for bout a wk no n I gotta say its not a bad phone for the $ it doesn't have any real special features just ur basic android phone but with a big a** screen its froze on me once n once it said it was fully charged after only being on charge only a few minutes but all n all its a good phone good graphics n video quality
Great product! I have no problems with the device
Wonderfull cellphone, very fast,  open and close proccess  quickly, very slim and perfect fit. I recomend this product. When you buy this  phone you should upgrade to Kit-Kat version. This procces take 30 min to download the OS and after it's so easy to upgrade. Just view the youtube link explaining the upgrade proccess and enjoy it...!
I tried this product even though it wasnt famous. I liked it. The screen is really big. And if you install a launcher, the icon becomes really clear. Any videos look really clear and crisp. However my sister bought me a new phone for my birthday. So I returned it. The service was quick and easy. I was glad to pay 15% restocking fee :)
You can hear better if you place your ear in the upper left corner. Volume is low when you place your ear in the upper center position. 5 star for the price. Very good smart phone with Google app, unlocked phone without expensive two year contract. I had purchased a sim card from ultra mobile , easy set up.plan start $19 and up.
I have had it for 2 days and it's huge and runs great only flaw is in the 2 days I've had it it's over heated !!!!! 4 times!!!!! It shows me Chinese letters and there is no way to restart it since the battery does not come out .... Its ridicules I thought with all the good reviews it would b worth it ..... Deff not
At first I LOVED IT! Then as I used it more and more I noticed that it's NOT a gaming phone. I play one drag racing game and where I was touching the screen stopped working. Also the internet stopped working and would only work on wifi. I fixed the internet by a google search. Other than that it's a great phone.
excellent cell has nothing to envy to samsung
Only had mine for a week. The lcd screen was cracking from the sides. Really bad speakers. It was really hard to hear the ringtones.<br/>The screen protector is so thin, it's almost impossible to put it without bubbles. Nice big phone. Picture quality good. Enough memory for what you pay for. Fast shipping.
Phone is okay. It cuts off when I play music, you have to press harder to type than you do with any other andriod, there's not a lot of options as far as setting individual ring tones, changing screen sensitivity, ect. Its good if your looking for just a basic phone for calls and text messaging.
do not want to do any more reviews for this phone considering I do not have it I get rid of it because the disease free G on his phone and I considered it a big piece of s*** tired of people trying to get ahold of me asking you questions is it on my phone it will work on any network leave me  alone
Very nice phone i feel like I got more what I paid for it has a big screen about half an inch bigger than I phone 6 plus I chose att as my carrier an had no problems I just didn't know the battery was built in but that's no problem overall the phone has a good price for the size quality
Phone was delivered not at the shipping address but was picked up at the post office after 4 days beyond the delivery date. Additionally,  the product is malfunctioned. There is nothing that displays on the screen other than little flashes and rippled images.  I am greatly disappointed!
I purchased this phone sometime ago close to a year. It has preformed flawlessly and I have been very satisfied. It was up gradable  so went from I think Jelly Bean up to Lolly Pop without a hitch. Battery life is good for such a large display. Best purchase I have made from Amazon.
Am the talk of the town, best phone ever
I have had this phone for a lil over a month. I love this phone. I updated it to lollipop....dropped and cracked the screen about two weeks ago on Bathroom floor. Completely lost touch functionality. However I ordered the replacement screen and digitizer and fixed it myself.
Good phone....all in one in a low price
Horrible phone its a nice size beautiful pictures but you can barely hear on it.it freezes a lot.AND after I dropped it while in the wallet case it really started acting up.at first it was a awesome phone now I'm forced to order another phone after only 2mos with this one
Love this phone so much, I purchased 5 more for my family member. It's nice, cheap, big, clear screen, easy to use. It's better then the competitors, especially when cell phones only last a max of one year. I use this phone for everything. I hardly use my laptop anymore.
I've had this phone for 4 months now.  Still amazing in every aspect.  No issues.  My only complaint is I'm still waiting for the new update for lollipop 5 which I was told about 2 1/2 months ago.  Though I'm looking to upgrade now to the LTE version of the phone soon
Consider myself tech savy, keep up with all new technology. I switched from the Samsung Galaxy line on a whim. Best thing I ever did. This phone is fast, excellent display, reliable and hasn't hung up or lagged since I got it.<br/>Samsung doesn't preform as well.
For $130 I couldn't imagine giving it less than 5 stars. Of course the bigger brands have better features, but this phone is the same exact thing without all the other stuff you will never use. The camera is 8.0 MP and it's pretty fast. I'm very pleased so far.
Excellent Smartphone. 6" a very good size. Put in my SIM, put in my 32GB MicroSD card, turned it on, and it works like a charm. Design, layout, & configuration are perfectly done. Good price. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a 6" Smartphone.
The studio 6.0 is a great phone,the build quality is outstanding. the features of the phone are great,and though it doesn't have a few features of other phones it's still amazing.9/10 for me especially w/its price tag of under $200.00,you can't beat it. Great job BLU.
This phone sucks! Every bad review is correct. The speaker volume is the worse! I could bearly hear anyone. The loud speaker is what the volume should sound like when on.  I feel sick that I brought it. Sorry that I didn't take my time to read reviews.
Don't ever buy this phone. I order 5.0 initially and back cover was damaged and it didn't boot inspite of charging 24 hours.<br/>I order this phone (BLU Studio 6.0 ) later and display is damaged. I am surprised how can Amazon sell such crappy stuff.
This is my second week into owning the Blu Studio HD 6.0- (Black 8G). The size, feel & design of the phone is really nice i must give it that a nice screen that pops out at you with very good HD display and brightness adjustments based on your eyes needs ... i am presently running Android Lollipop 5.0 on it  and it seem to be working fine thus far. However i have been having a few problems with the phone note sure if its hardware or software problem or they can be fixed with a systems update.<br/><br/>Here are the problems I am presently having:<br/><br/>1. The phone volume is very very very low....and when playing music its sounds as thou the speakers are straining to play which resulted in the audio not being Clair. when talking on the phone the call volume is very very low as well despite all the internal systems volumes be at it fullest.<br/><br/>2. The notification light on the front of the phone next to the sensor has not work since i have received the phone so i am unable too see if i get a message unless i turn the screen on. (NOT SURE IF THERE IS SOME SETTING I HAVE NOT TURN ON ?)<br/><br/>3.Sometimes the battery will be at 12% after a long day of use, when plug in the battery will jump to 80% charge only after being plug in for 5mins (NOT SURE IF THAT'S NORMAL) on other occasions the battery would charge perfect and last the hole day depending on my use..<br/><br/>I presently live in Jamaica so I’m a little unsure of what to do if i should send the phone back via shipping as i may have gotten one that has a few factory defects. Maybe you Amazon can help me on what to do.<br/><br/>Other than the 3 listed problems stated above the phone works well, maybe Blu Company can fix these problems via a system update not sure..... i would recommend this phone to everyone who's looking a phone on an affordable budget..
Great for the price ! Need to work on better camera  image quality. The blu 6.0 HD has a better looking 8 mp camera than this 13 mp camera. I compared side by side . There is more vivid color and clarity In the 6.0  HD 8 mp camera . maybe its the lenses ? the 4Glte works GREAT on T-Mobile . speed tests as high as 55 mbps. The screen is massive with great HD quality.<br/><br/>Cons : microphone sucks always have a problem with people hearing me even after the software update that was supposed to fix that .<br/><br/>After several months of using  it and countless times of dropping it ( with case they give you on screen never broke really amazed  I must of dropped it over 30 times since I got the phone and that was close to its launch date ) certain apps won't install on my phone from the play store . Says could not install on SD card or internal storage I have formated both SD and internal and even did master reset and still get same issue . I read from other forums that it could be a kernel problem as ssung experienced a similar issue before . this eff I love this phone and after close to 7 months of heavy use I'm about to look into a note 4 or HTC 9 . Great deal for the cash and good quality. But I need great quality and Blu just can't seem to deliver device that is great quality all around. I feel that when they showcase a main selling point in a model they take away from other parts of the phone by going with lesser quality . Make a true HIGH END DEVICE and people will pay for it. stop with the gimmicks 13 mp cameras on your selfie phone front and back  look like they are 5 mp maybe a horrible 8.  If you guys improve this model I'll buy one. Best big FAST phone you guys made  yet for sure though .if you want better camera go with 6.0hd if you want LTE get this .
I bought this phone for my mom because it's big and easy to see the screen for her. I had to open up the package first because I had to set it up for my mom so all she has to do is put the SIM card in after I sent it to her. It really does look nice and I wasn't expecting this quality for the price, it made me want one for myself actually and I currently have an S3.<br/><br/>It only comes with ONE screen protector so there's no room for bubble/debri errors, what I would recommend you do is have the screen protector ready to go for after you peel off the "spec" plastic from the screen, since it's a clean surface. I actually had to peel it off once after I'd placed it and I still didn't get ANY bubbles/debri under the screen protector.. The case looks really nice and sleek although it doesn't "fully" protect it from a severe drop, but it's enough protection if you're not careless with your phone, and it doesn't add unnecessary bulk.<br/><br/>I feel like the screen took a little while to "warm up" to touch, or maybe my hands were cold or something because it wasn't 100% responsive when I first turned on the phone. After a while it was fine to touch and responsive enough.<br/><br/>The phone takes a very long time to charge, or maybe it's because it was the first time it was being charged, but it took hours to get from around 15% battery to 99%, something like 6 hours,  it takes my S3 2-3 hours to charge from dead to 100%, but it also burns through the battery really fast. I hope that the battery life isn't atrocious because my mom doesn't know anything about cycling the battery or cellphone battery health, and I guess in the event the battery does die eventually I can literally just buy her another phone since they are so cheap.<br/><br/>I can't say anything about the camera because I didn't test it out since I won't be using the phone myself.<br/><br/>I kept the headphones because my mom doesn't use them and I needed new headphones. The headphones are actually really nice, they really get in your ear which is nice because I mostly use them when I'm working out (mostly running). The only fall out once or twice in a 60 minute workout but that's mainly due to the sweat that travels INTO my ears, earphones are not magical, so it's completely acceptable. They have a pretty clear mic and the mic itself is not extremely heavy that you feel one side is heavier than the other.<br/><br/>I'll update once my mom has used it for a bit and report back. I think that this is a cheap smartphone for parents, especially since it's so big and the "Enormous" text setting is pretty big.
Loved it but with a few caveats:<br/>------------------------------------<br/>Pros:<br/>A/ 4g, loved the download speed<br/>B/ Big, beautiful display (I'm 56 yerars young and need it.) Average touch sensitivity, /Barely better than galaxy 3 in sunlight. Barely. Still unusuable.<br/>C/ NICE LOOKING,<br/>D/ Simplistic menus, fairly comprehensive settings page (weirdly one extra click deeper as 'settings' takes you to notifications first)<br/>E/ Pretty responsive for the money.<br/>F/ Pretty good battery life with my daily usage, better than the Galaxy S3.<br/>G/ Takes a full 64 gig of  micro flash ram, unlike it's faster, bigger flash ram cousin, the 6.0 LTE<br/>H/ MOvies look good on it.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>A/ Crashed, Crashed, Crashed whenever any amount of power use warmed it up. I got one of the lemons. If you read all over the net, this phone seesm to have its share of them.<br/>B/ USB jack is FLIMSY. Be very careful with it..<br/>C/ Not a lot of wall papers or sounds compared to the Galaxy S3.<br/>D/ Volume controls don't change 'in context'. The volume controls seem to only be separately controllable in the settings page or  through some special key seque3nce, which I currently forget. The Galaxy series does media when you're watching a movie, phone earphone volume when you're in a call, ringer when nothing else is running, etc. HONESTLY though, the whole Android series is lacking a few extra 'channels' of volume control. All it is is a few extra ram locations, COME ON Google!<br/>E/ As all reviews that are a complete say about this, the volume in all cases is a little low, just usable. The key to usability is EXACT alignment with your ear in phone mode, and using your hand or a hard surface to reflect eh back speaker. The back speaker is AT THE BOTTOM, which makes it wasy to cover with your hand and makes it a full 5 inches further from your ear . . . . NOT a good idea.<br/>F/  I don't  know if this is a Samsung 'copyrighted/patented' feature, but I don't remember this phone being able to phone or text form either 'recent texts, or recent phone calls, the way the Galaxies do. (Apple doesn't either on the one my company bought for me, and is WAY clunkier to change from phone to text, YUCKY!.<br/><br/>Final Analysis: I miss it. (Just returned it to Walmart Brick and MOrtar after buyin git at Walmart.com.) MIGHT muy  another. IF YOU GET ONE THAT WORKS AND STAYS WORKING, YOU CANNOT BEAT THE PERFORMANCE+FEATURE/PRICE RATIO.
This device isn’t going to go head-to-head with the iPhone 6+, or the Galaxy S6 in terms of performance or features, its $150 smartphone after all; but I would say there’s probably not a better 6” smartphone on the market right now for the money. You get a ton of value with this device for $150.<br/><br/>Probably the most outstanding feature for the price is the fact that this is a quad-band, dual SIM, factory unlocked device. The primary SIM slot is quad-band (CDMA/GSM), and the secondary SIM slot is GSM only. There are two IMEI codes since there are two SIMs; each SIM has its own antenna, and the SMS messenger and phone interface denotes which SIM/carrier you’re using for each communication you send/receive. Insofar, the call quality so far has been excellent.<br/><br/>The UI responsiveness is not as fast or fluid as the high-end Galaxy S series, or Note series. Again, this device is about $500 cheaper than the unlocked versions of those, so you’re going to take a hit on performance if you have a ton of apps running in the background and are trying to jump between open apps quickly. I can actively use any app on this phone with minimal or no lag with all of the following apps running in the background: Facebook, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Skype.<br/><br/>The cameras are adequate, not bad, but nothing special either. The 8MP front facing camera is about as good at close range as most other mid-tier phones. The built-in beautifier tools that come with Android Kit-Kat can actually yield some decent shots. The 2MP selfie camera is good enough for video chatting, but neither the selfie camera or the front facing camera have image stabilization, so you’ll need a steady hand to get decent clarity. But the sheer size of the screen makes taking pictures with this device a rewarding activity since you can see your photo at a near print-size.<br/><br/>I really enjoy the design of the phone. It’s large, but not awkward. If you have large hands like mine, then if feels perfectly natural holding it up to your head and making a call. It’s light, thin, has gently curved edges, and has great ergonomics for extended usage. It’s surprisingly portable – slipping in and out of my pants pockets with ease. Removing the rear cover plate to access the SIM slots and micro-SD slot is very easy. And despite its size, it’s compatible with most universal accessories (gamepads, folding cases, etc.)<br/><br/>Definitely worth the money in my opinion. You can’t get a better deal for a brand new 6” factory unlocked Android at $150.
This is a good phone at a good price. It is huge and bumps that too big button. The phone responds very quickly to all commands, it launches apps super-fast, the screen is crisp and clear, and the camera is pretty good. There's a lot to like about this phone. If you are in the market for a monster phone, this is a good choice.<br/><br/>The phone uses standard size SIM cards. So if you are migrating from a phone with a tiny SIM card, you'll either have to buy a new SIM card or purchase an adapter (there are plenty of inexpensive $4 adapters on Amazon). The great news with this phone - there is no silly SIM card drawer, so you can't really mess up with an adapter. Dual SIM cards means you can load this phone up with a SIM card for the United States and a second for Europe - or other country. You could also straddle the dual carrier deal (prepaid plan and a pay as you go card). Switching between cards is super easy to do.<br/><br/>There is a slot for a MicroSD card, so the phone is expandable up to 64 GB beyond the internal storage.<br/><br/>The back is flexible plastic and snaps off fairly easily. The only reason to pop off the back is for the SIM card or MicroSD card access. That's something you'll do once or twice with the phone. The battery is soldered into the phone. I thought a plastic back would be nasty, this one is very nice.<br/><br/>The phone charges with a microUSB cable. This thing has a really long battery life - you can easily use the phone all day on a single charge.<br/><br/>I used this on ATT. Reception and data was exactly what I expected. I tested this in the car, in a town where phone calls always drop on my Samsung Galaxy S5 Active - the BLU phone dropped calls exactly the same. Call clarity is outstanding with this phone.<br/><br/>I think this phone is just too big. It really just exactly crossed the threshold of a big phone to monster size. It still just barely fits in my pants pocket. It is a little difficult to use one handed - the phone is really wide.<br/><br/>For an unlocked phone - this thing is outstanding. If I didn't mind a locked phone, I'd get the Galaxy S5 on contract. But then I wouldn't have a phone for foreign travel.
The BLU Studio 6.0 HD Smartphone is an excellent device, offering a phone with many nice features at a great off-contract price.  BLU does a great job of making their product feeling premium and overall, it's a good device for just about anybody.<br/><br/>Opening the box, you get a pretty nice experience.  It's well packaged and includes a screen protector, headset, and case.  Most manufacturers don't include all the extras and expect you to purchase them individually.  So receiving them up front is a nice touch.  The case has a firm grip to it and fit the phone very well.  The cutout for the headphone jack was a little rough, but not a big deal.  The screen protector was fairly average, fairly simple to install and did not disturb the use of the screen.  The only issue I had with the case was that it did make it difficult to use the buttons, but that is often the issue with cases.<br/><br/>While the 6" screen is a bit large, it is a really nice display.  It's clear and bright.  The phone itself feels fairly light for a 6" device, but it's still a little bulky in your pocket.  Performance was very nice.  Most applications were snappy.  The processor held its own and the 1GB RAM was adequate.  Obviously, I would prefer more internal storage, but it's a great start.  You can add a micro SD card if the 8GB isn't enough (and it likely won't be enough).  That's an easy fix though and memory cards are super cheap these days.<br/><br/>Phone quality was excellent when I tried it on the AT&T; network.  Internet browsing on both the cellular network and Wi-Fi was good.  Camera was good and more than adequate, but not the camera of a premium or flagship device.  The charging port is on top, which some people love and some people hate.  I'm somewhat indifferent, but prefer a charging port on the bottom.<br/><br/>One issue I had was with buttons.  The volume is on the left, directly across from the power/lock button on the opposite side.  While it may not be an issue on smaller phones, I found myself adjusting the volume when hitting the lock button.  The size of the device made me hold the device in a way where my thumb kept hitting the volume.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm very pleased with the BLU Studio 6 HD.  It feels like a premium device.  While it does have a few minor quirks, the specifications hold up well and the phone is very easy to like and enjoy.
Back in 2010, Dell introduced the Streak, a 5-inch device that was one of the earliest "phablets" (phone/tablet). At the time, 3.5 inch screens were the norm and people made fun of the Streak being so large. How quaint. Nowadays, screens from 5 to 5.5 inches are extremely popular. So here comes the Blu Studio 6.0 . It's hardly the only 6-incher out there, but there aren't many, and there's a good reason why. It's just too darned big to use comfortably as a phone. I'm a big guy (6'4") with large hands, but I just couldn't hold the Studio 6.0 comfortably as a phone.<br/><br/>As a phone, the Studio 6.0 is functionally quite nice. It's unlocked quad-band GSM with two SIM slots, something very common in the international market. It has HSPA+ support, but only at the slower 21Mbps rate. There is no LTE support.<br/><br/>As a tablet, the Studio 6.0 is fine as well, though the WiFi is b/g/n on 2.4GHz only.There's very little in the way of bloatware or custom interfaces, so you get pretty much a standard Android 4.4.2 (KitKat) experience. Unlike the Blu Vivo Air I reviewed earlier, everything I tried on the Studio HD worked and there were no disabled features. The screen was bright and colors popped, and the camera seemed to do a decent job. The battery is not removable, but there is an internal slot for a MicroSD card (up to 32GB.) The processor is somewhat sluggish compared to many other devices, but the low price is certainly good compensation.<br/><br/>If you think of the Studio 6.0 HD as a small tablet that happens to make phone calls, it works fine for that. And if you think you won't mind holding such a large device to your head, then it's a fine (though not class-leading) phone.
Review is on the black 8 gig BLU 6.0 HD version sold by Amazon.<br/><br/>So far a very pleasant upgrade all around from a Samsung S2 (4.3" screen). Size matters.<br/><br/>Things I love:  Just plugged my existing Straighttalk sim in and it took right off, came with Kit Kat 4.4.2 installed already, that 6" screen for one (kindle is easier read, as well as everything else), I can run the latest apps, cleanness of the install of android (no bloat), new navigation voice and functionality (use this a lot), battery life, screen quality, fits in my jeans front pocket well enough<br/><br/>Problems:  Volume controls (mostly because with one hand I'm hitting power also), Can't install latest update to KitKat (tried everything I know, no dice)<br/><br/>Entertainment: 3D games worked better than I thought the Mali GPU would manage, Netflix played without a hitch also but I couldn't screen cast it.<br/><br/>Additional comments:  I had read that this phone has GPS problems and the solution was to set it to a higher level by using cell tower's and wireless for positioning references. I mount my phone to the windshield (good access to the sky) and have and no problems with normal GPS tracking via satellite only. It's actually been very good and better than my S2 was.<br/><br/>Something else I had concerned about was using a mini USB to charge it. Thinking I would have problems getting it inserted. I did have problems. I figured out it had nothing to do with the phone and was strictly a problem with the included case. I cut out the screen side/facing piece with scissors which was blocking the USB cable connector and keeping it from seating properly. The case still holds snug to the phone but doesn't block the USB charging port now and every USB cable works. Same thing with the headset port. Case was obstructing it.<br/><br/>ramblings:  Will BLU "Bold Like Us" release Lollipop for it? I'm thinking they will because this phone is pretty popular and I suspect sales will be strong for some time. Plus it's a good time to win some fan support while they have a popular product. And, ummm, why do people answer questions people ask with non answers? Do people think they are being spoke to directly about product questions? Has the movie Idiocracy become a reality? eg Q - "What is the actual screen size?"  A - "I don't know, don't have the phone."  <stares in disbelief><br/><br/>Update: 5/31/2015 - Annnnddddd boom...!!! Lolipop!! :)<br/>Runs noticeably better on Lollipop I think. Does for me at least.
I spend two hours on the train every day so I kill a lot of time on my phone. The Blu Studio 6 offers a generous 6 inch screen which is perfect for videos, reading, games. Colors and sharpness are adequate, not particularly vibrant (you would be well advised to limit your expectations if you've owned high DPI electronics before) but WOW this screen can get bright if you put it on it's max setting. On it's highest setting I can walk through a brilliantly lit summer parking lot without having to cup my hand over the screen.<br/><br/>You would think the large well lit screen would mean short battery life but the Studio 6.0 HD packs an impressive 3,000 mah battery which means even when my kid unplugged my phone the night before I can use it all the second day and still get home without a dead phone. Blu definitely delivered on this battery.The value is excellent, but where the money is saved is build material: this phone is plastic, it feels plastic, and the power button and volume rockers do not offer a satisfying click but instead a soft response. If you take care of your devices like I do then it should last a few years without any problems, but in the hands of a teenager I would expect one of these buttons to be the first thing to fail. If the Studio 6 just received the same metal back as the Studio 5.5 it would have seriously helped the presentation.<br/><br/>The final cut corner is the camera, it's unremarkable. I can never seem to get a crisp picture out of it but then again I'm trying to get pictures of a toddler so they're naturally blurry. Pictures taken outdoors are again, adequate.I'm a "praise by exception" kinda guy and everything else is great: smooth and responsive, massive screen, comes with a good flex cover, easily upgrades to Android KitKat, and you aren't going to beat the value.
BIG WARNING TO THOSE WHO BUY THIS PHONE USED, BLU WILL NOT HONOR THE 1-YEAR WARRANTY, EVEN IF THE PHONE IS LESS THAN A YEAR OLD AND STILL WITHIN WARRANTY!!!<br/><br/>As so many others state, if I could give this product a rating of zero stars, I would. Within less than a month of purchase, the phone began to malfunction, randomly turning off by itself for seemingly no reason, even when the battery had a full charge. In one instance, the phone shut off by itself at the airport right before I was about to use the Southwest App to check into gate to catch my flight, which led to me having to ask to use the app on another passenger's phone to check in. You can imagine how fun it is to have a phone that turns off by itself at random times, without any warning.<br/><br/>Calling customer support is the equivalent of banging your head into the wall, but only if the wall was made entirely out of very sharp scissors, as their response to my phone issue was to "try turning the phone off and on", even though I told them repeatedly that I couldn't even get the phone to turn on.<br/><br/>Customer service also stated that they "are aware of several issues with this phone model", but if that is the case, then why was the phone never recalled and more importantly, WHY ARE THEY STILL SELLING IT!!?<br/><br/>So now I have a $100 piece of junk that I can't even get to turn on. The old saying goes, if something sounds too good to be true, then it probably is, and this phone is the embodiment of that statement. Please, save your money and just pay a little extra for a phone from a company that will not try to do everything in its power to avoid helping fix the crappy products they sell!
I've had this phone for a while now and I have to say I'm very impressed with it. I was worried that I might be getting into uncharted waters when ordering it. It's not your typical brand that you can get in stores (at least not where I'm located). I'm used to using LG, Samsung and other familiar brands.<br/><br/>This phone competes with the best of them. What I loved the most about this phone is that the screen is vibrant and large. I hate having to strain my eyes to read something on smaller screens, and this phone eliminated that issue. The phone also came with: A silicone protective case, a screen protector application, earbuds with microphone, and charger. So you don't have to order anything else with it.<br/><br/>Setting up the SIM card was a breeze. I'm currently with the Walmart Family Mobile Plan and it works flawlessly.<br/><br/>My only two slight draw back is the fact that the battery isn't removable so it makes me wonder if it will last for a while after repeated use. The battery life holds for one full day of usage. That can vary depending on apps running and backlit display (amongst other things) Another problem was the sound. It's not the worst but its not the greatest either. Sound quality is just midrange, and not as loud or clear as other phones. But you'd be fine with it.<br/><br/>The phone itself has attracted a lot of attention and people are curious about BLU more and more they see me use it.<br/><br/>This is a good phone for the somewhat average user. I don't talk a lot, I usually text and browse and use different apps. It gets the job done. I suggest if you are a hard core user, you should consider getting a powerpak to take around with you.
This is my 4th blu phone (in a good way) in the last 3 months. Blu had a sale and I got the first 3 phones for cheap, and its not worth the hassle to return them, as they perform great for the price. Here are the phones I own<br/><br/>1) Blu Life 8: I bought this phone just for the price and without knowing anything about this brand. When I got this phone, I was surprised with the fit and finish and looks nice an sleek. Antutu score was 30844, and it ranks just below LG G3. I found no delays and everything runs fast and quick. I love this phone and its quite awesome. It runs KitKat and no lollipop support<br/><br/>2) Blu Studio 5 LTE: I was so impressed with my first phone, so I got LTE variant. This phone is not as fast as Life 8, and its struck with Jelly Bean and just 4GB ROM. In these days 4GB is just not enough, and even though I have a 64gb SD card loaded, Internal memory gets full so quick and I am unable to download large games like Asphalt as there is no memory to download the game.<br/><br/>3) Blu Dash 5.5: This is one of their Budget phones, but comes with a 5.5 screen. Screen resolution is very low compared to the above  720p phones, and surprisingly runs KitKat. If you are on budget, and all you do is make calls and browse, then this one fits the bill.<br/><br/>4) Blu Studio 6 HD: This phone has a 6" 720p screen, but not as fast as the life 8. Infact Antutu score is 17936 and it rated this as an average device and ranks at the bottom. Phone is nice and sleek with a gorgeous 6" screen, but at times it CPU cant catch up and there is a few second delay when switching between apps.<br/><br/>To me Clearly, Blue Life 8 is a winner in all departments.
This is everything you could want in a budget phablet. Its not the most powerful, but fits the bill. Screen is responsive and big, battery life is good. I would recommend this phone. Much like a nexus with the android version. No bloatware!!!
The phone looks nice and awesome and but after that I bought it and take it back home to Jamaica the phone is over heating u can't even hold it close to your house ear and am all the we in Jamaica now stuck with me a phone that is no good
I recieved this phone in the mail yesterday, and I've put it through two days of testing. First of all I couldn't reccomend this phone highly enough. If you're worried about the 720p display not being sharp enough, don't be. Coming from someone who LOVES pixels and has used the nexus 5 with twice the pixel density of this phone, I can barely tell the difference. The battery life on this phone is incredible, though I very highly reccomend getting battery doctor on the google play store. It's free, and works amazing. Every few times you unlock your phone quickly go in the app and press optimize, then when it beings you to a screen telling you about your running apps, press optimize again. This will make your battery life even better, I will be including a screenshot of some usage I got with this phone, its at 52 percent and I have 2 hours and 50 minutes of screen on time. This includes streaming YouTube videos to my Chromecast, playing a bit of dead trigger, which is a great game that I would reccomend getting and it runs almost perfectly on this phone, and I've also taken some pictures and done a lot of texting, and downloaded some apps. I was quick to get used to the size, and now I can't stand to use smaller phones. I hated watching YouTube videos on my previous phones, but this phone is amazing for browsing the web, and I would go as far to say that I would rather use it than my computer. Overall, this phone is amazing. It runs smooth, can play games almost as well as my nexus 5 did, if not as good, it has incredible battery life, a bright screen, and has the best experience I've ever had in a phone. I'd you want a big phone for a small price, get this phone.
Don't underestimate this phone. I am totally impressed with it. The screen resolution is excellent. Hold the phone in any direction while watching a video and no fading. Battery life is way better than I expected also. Easily go all day depending how hard you use it. Standby time depends on what you have running in the background. For me, way better than I expected. Permanent non removal battery. This version operates on 4G networks (duel sim cards) not on the 4G LTE. So if download speeds above 8.5 Mbs are needed buy the LTE version. Camera is excellent. Time-laps operations, panoramic plus full manual or full auto control options are fantastic. Screen brightness is real bright. I have mine turned down about half way most of the time. Automatic brightness for me truns it down to low for me. Volume & power buttons functions excellent without the provided case installed, with the case installed there is an issue. Nice soft case but buttons need to be pressed harder. Ear piece volume and sound quality is very good. One important thing is that you need to make sure the phone is centered over your ear correctly, otherwise you'll think there's something wrong with the sound level. Speaker volume is loud and clear but not as high as other phones I've used. Headphones provided and are very good quality and come with microphone. Tangle free flat type cord. Also phone comes with 1 free screen protector that seems to be pretty tough and durable. This phone is priced well and worth the money. Even the LTE version is priced well.  Look out Apple, Samsung, HTC, Motorola and LG. Blu Products built this phone right. Plus two phone lines in one. USA
I hate this phone! The charger that came with it doesn't charge it, and the battery dies very quickly. It over heats a lot, and I can hardly hear out of it at times. I ordered a new phone and it works like it may be refurbished instead.
I had this phone for a week and love it the only problem with this device is the in call volume ringer and even when I put head phones in its to low I hope BLU brings this phone back out with LTE and louder speakers I would buy it again
We were more interested in the newer model, but noticed it seemed to have some glitches that need to be worked out first.<br/>This one still had most of the same features & did not disappoint! The HD quality is outstanding. Picture quality is good. It's fast and effective. Connected easily to other devices. Easily compares to a Samsung at a fraction of the price. We loved it so much, we came back and bought a second one a week later.<br/>Set up on the first one was easier, as it was a new activation (Net10) and we got the sim kit, which made programming the phone easy, as they sent the info directly to the phone for programming.<br/>Set up on the second one was a little bit more difficult, but not frustrating. I used an existing sim card (again, Net10), so the phone had to be programmed for the network. Step by step instructions were easily found on You Tube. It was done within 2-3 minutes.<br/>This is a larger device. Talking on the phone with it to your ear is a bit much. One of us uses the included earbuds/mic. One uses a Blue-Tooth. Call quality and sound is outstanding. Speaker volume is great for music.<br/>I liked the fact that it wasn't overloaded with apps that are never used!!<br/>It does come partially charged. This unit does take quite a long time to charge. I have a universal rapid charger purchased from a verizon store (lifetime replacement guarantee, $30) that speeds up the process, still it's a bit slow. Battery life is outstanding though!! Charged while sleeping, it lasts all day with heavy use.<br/>Having had the devices now for 3 & 4 weeks, we have nothing bad to say and do not regret these purchases!
Even do I just have a few days with this phone, I must say I love it.<br/><br/>Let's be honest 8mp front camera works good when my digital 24mp camera gets out of battery, the touch screen is very good and responsive.<br/><br/>I have a generic tablet with no sim card available, and the ability to shared the phone internet as a wifi router really makes the phone a great companion, 1GB of ram really is not such a big deal, anyways I don't install to many applications so does not bother on me,<br/><br/>even do I see just a few things that could make it better<br/><br/>1. more battery life, yes the battery goes down quite fast, an external battery charger is quite a must here, know I must decide if I charge the phone or the tablet when both goes out of battery :P , I hate that everyone in every company says "let's make the phone like an amazing droid that can even cook for you" but I never see companies saying "let's make a battery that can really last and performed like any other battery ever built" you know what I mean.<br/><br/>2. Build-in battery, if the battery gets busted the phone will go the garbage as well, this I really don't like it.<br/><br/>3. The screen protector should come already set on the device, yeap, I really sucks putting screen protectors on phones and tablets, many people are, so why not just set it over? I try to put this one on my own and got some bubbles on it, now I have to purchase a new screen protector and have some one that can put it in nicely to do it :(<br/><br/>Don't take me wrong from above points, I still believe this is an awesome phone for the price.
This phone had a beautiful screen and ran awesome, BUT I purchased 3 of the same phone and all 3 screens busted within the first 1-2 months. The material used to build these phones is terrible and I would not recommend this phone.
It started off great then the constant reboot when im gaming or internet browsing it takes a few minutes to come back on since the battery is non removable after a couple of weeks it turn off and never rebooted it just died on me
The 6.0 screen display is good. The quality of the rear camera is not the best but it is okay for those persons who don't necessarily need  to take high quality photos. It is easy to use. Overall it is a nice phone. I love it.
I have had this phone for two months I have no issues works great.. One thing I can't not use is video calling b/c not available in the states yet please update that soon would be great for me to use for my friends in military
Camera could be a little better.
I absolutely love this phone. The screen is just gorgeous and has an amazing contrast, not to mention the seemingly endless viewing angle.  Personally, I am using the phone with Straight Talk and had zero issues seeing it up to work with them. The phone has never crashed, I've dropped it twice and no damage resulted, and I have never been frustrated by the performance of the device like I had with my last phone.<br/><br/>The screen is large, and everyone who sees the phone has commented on how big it is. I have large hands and think it is the perfect size for me. I have no trouble navigating the screen with one thumb. I like that it ships with a very stripped down version of Android, no bloated software package!<br/><br/>Complaints:<br/>1) The included screen protector had two 'peel here' stickers, which must have been adhered with super glue because simply trying to peel them off left bits of the sticker and a glob of stubborn residue so difficult to remove that the protector was unusable.<br/>2) The included case is passable, but trying to use another charging cable other than the included one doesn't allow a secure connection because the hole in the case is too small for most plugs to fit properly. A trim with a hobby knife fixed that in two minutes.<br/>3) The battery is built in to this device. I hope the battery never give me fits, but it is a LIPO (lithium-polymer) battery so it should last a good long while.<br/><br/>To summarize: The value of this phone is unreal, I would buy this phone again, hands down, and will if this one ever fails.
The phone is great I had no problem getting started just charge the battery and the rest is history sound is very I Even plug my 1200watts wireless speaker up to it and it sounds great all-round the phone isgreat!!!!!!!!!!!
Just got my phone yesterday and I must say I am very happy with it, nice big screen, comes with a screen protector and back case cover, camera quality is good front and back, sound quality is great, no complaints on my end
Have not quite had a week yet but love it.  Shipped on time, arrived in proper packaging.  This phone rocks so far.  Just finished updating to android 5.0.2 Lollipop and it seems to run even smoother.  I will list some of the very few cons that I have came up with on the phone, but none are enough to lower this from a five star phone especially when you consider I paid $134 for it and it compares equally or pretty close to equal to my wife's note 4.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/> Battery life, has not been really bad but I would like it to be better.  Lasts the entire day on a charge and charges pretty quickly.  Would be nice to be able to replace the battery if needed or with a spare.<br/><br/>Cases, there are not very many cases available for the phone.<br/><br/>Bluetooth would not work in airplane mode.  This is a must for my job.  I was able to turn off the sim card and in a sense did the same as airplane mode and still allowed me to connect to my blue tooth speaker/headset for music.  The lollipop update that I just downloaded has fixed this issue it seems.<br/><br/>Call volume OK.  This is a big phone so sometimes my ear was not on the right part of the phone.  Even when on the right spot the volume is sufficient but not great.  We will see how lollipop does with this.<br/><br/>OVERALL<br/><br/>Don't pass on this phone simply because it is an unknown brand when compared to the big guys like apple and samsung.  I have owned them all and for the value as well as the awesomeness of the phone you can not go wrong in my opinion.
I bought this item  and it lasted only a month. This stupid phone doesn't worth crap .I am unable to hear anything on the phone . This is definitely a waste of money . DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!!!!!!!! I REPEAT DO NOT PURCHASE
Bought this for my son.  Works great with AT&T.;  He has not had any problems with it.  He is not a heavy user, but is probably average for a 16 year old.  The battery lasts all day but he needs to charge it every night.
Phone was great until my son cracked the screen. Unfortunately no phone repair place anywhere will repair it because its not one of the big name manufacturers. So if your considering this phone just keep that in mind.
This Phone Is Absolutely  Amazing  I haven't  had any problems  with it...I received  the phone the next day as promised even  though  it was inclement  weather  in my Area....Great Quality  phone at a fair price....
Phone totally stopped working w/ No Drops, No Spills, No Ill Usage or Moisture Damage. On one day and totally dead by the next; would not charge. Hearing and speaker quality extremely poor!!!!! Returning Merchandise.
When I find out how stop making accidental calls I I might give it anther star. so far I think it's a real good phone.It's it's the best of both worlds, I don't need a tablet now. It's a great deal for the money...
Bought this phone, after 3 days i reset it because of an update, it when on recovery mode and all i see is a bunch of chinese words, the phone is stuck on recovery mode and have no idea what to do... Dont buy it.
The speaker is just not a quality speaker when u talk it'sow u can barely hear on ir n it sounds like the other party is over seas n u can't understand what they are saying I'm getting ready to send it back.
Its a big phone but I love it
It is day 4 with the BLU Studio 6.0 HD phone, and I have to say that I am impressed with it!  I had to replace my SIII and was not up to spending another $400+ for a new phone.  I came across this one looking for unlocked phones, and bought it based on the reviews....and I am glad that I did!!<br/>Battery was at 97% when I went to sleep last night, woke up and it was at 86% (8.5 hours) used it as normal throughout the day, Clash of Clans, FB, text etc... by end of lunch 2pm it was at 55%.  Pretty good for the price.<br/>Screen is very clear, games, Netflix everything looks fantastic on this screen... everything from my Google+ account downloaded immediately after turning on the phone and signing into Google.  The only thing that I can see some nitpickers have said in the reviews is that the touch screen is not that sensitive.  I have had the ultra-sensitive SIII the BLU is not that sensitive but not such a difference that I would consider it a Con.<br/>The speakers work better than my SII ever did very clear, calls have been clear as well, just have to get used to having a 6 inch phone against your head when not using Bluetooth...<br/>The case that came with the phone is decent, but there does not seem to be a large selection for covers for this line anyways, it serves its purpose.<br/>I only gave 4 stars based on that I have only had it for 4 days and I do not know how well the phone performs over time.<br/><br/>Update: 6-23-15<br/>Still working great! Now just on performance and not the actual features for the OS, the update to Lollipop for Android has increased the performance of this phone.  Before with KitKat there would be a lag once in a great while with games and other Apps.  But since the update to Lollipop there has been no issues! It is performing even better, and the picture (vids) is actually clearer than before!  We have bought a second one because of the value at the price on Amazon now for below $130…  Still a great phone, everyone that sees it and uses/tries it out loves it and is amazed that I got it at the time for $150.  My wife has an IPhone 6+ and this phablet performs just as good, her camera is slightly better though. But at 8mega pixels it is still a great camera.  Also the tech specs are the same if not better than some of the other comparable “brand” names pitched by the big carriers.. Overall still a great deal! AND A MUST- buy the Armorflex case even though the colors aren’t that great it is the only true protective case for this phone..<br/>*** If you are buying new now you have to do 2-3 system updates for this phone.  It has to update to KitKat, then the updated KitKat version then finally to Lollipop. So after charging and turning on the phone just keep checking for System updates until it updates to Lollipop, then update all of your personal info so you only have to do it once!!
I love the size and price. I hate the latest version of software, and its propensity to vibrate at every opportunity. NOT RECOMMENDED WITH LATEST ANDROID BUILD (Android Ice Cream Sandwich I believe)..
This phone is insanely good battery life quality and screen is better than that describe super HD quality and no freeze ups like my other 600$ phone I had...best money I ever spent well worth it...
GOT THE PHONE SO FAR GOOD :)
This a piece of crap I've had for about 2 month's I want my money back I just order H T C 610 from you.  after charging all night it came on in Chinese Please call me on house number 256-660-0641
Oh my stars !!!! First off Amazon.com did did not have to send me a reminder for me to remember to leave feedback for the awesomeness of this phone. Ooohhh my gosh !!! It's truly unbelievable how this phone comes so very close in comparison with my Note 3. I'm just so ecstatic about its looks and functions. I bought it as a gift for my mother thinking since I paid a cheaper price for this one other than my galaxy note 3 it would really look like some cheap knock off branded phone, but no way. The battery even last longer than my Galaxy Note 3, which was unexpected, but another reason to love this phone. It even shows beautifully, not to even mention how fast it goes through websites. I truly love how large the apps are on screen, then the google apps that are available as well. I am an extremely satisfied customer as well as my mother who I gifted this item too. I'm considering getting a phone like this as a backup to my Galaxy Note 3 if anything happens to it. Another thing is the size is just right even for women who are known to have small hands. Along with its size, the phone is very light weight, which may be lighter than my Note 3 as well. I love how sleek and thin it is, this phone just even looks and feel like it could be worth 800 dollars. It's been nearly a week since I've owned this phone but so far so great!!!!!!
I bought this phone as I wanted something simple, and without a lot of carrier junk loaded on it.  It was a less expensive choice over a nexus6.  It has a great feel without a case, but with the silicone cover it's bulky, and it's huge and heavy (8.3 oz)<br/>I found the lock button hard to find without the cover.  It is flush with the body.  The cover supplied had buttons over the phone buttons making them easier to find.<br/>Also, other complaints I read about the back being hard to remove proved true for me also. The notch was hard to find, and the back requires enough effort to remove that I thought I was going to break it.<br/>The interface was very different than my samsung s2 for apps, messaging, phone etc.  The Studio 5.5s I bought was more familiar to me and easy to use.<br/>I like others had problems with chargers and ear bud plugs. There was some trimming to the cases to get these to seat properly.<br/>Even when they looked right, they weren't.<br/>Overall they are a really nice phone, and the price is great.  I ended up keeping the 5.5s  as it's a little smaller, lighter and more familiar for me.  There are very few cases or accessories made for these 6.0  most cases are wallet style, or have a kickstand, but no belt clip.<br/>I forgot to add the battery is built in, no no switching.  The sim cards and micro sd install easily.
Bought one of these for my Mom, it is a nice phone, nice screen, like the stock android 4.4 kit kat. The overall phone is good, not as good as my note 3 but for the money it's really good.<br/><br/>Here is the bad<br/>1 - charge port is garbage, when you plug it in if you even look at it the connector come a little loose and stops charging, but it looks like it is still in all the way, so when you come back hours later expecting a full charge its dead<br/><br/>2 - the notification leds are there but they don't work, every android phone I've ever had has the notification leds that tell you if it's charging, charged, or if you have a message, this phone had the leds, but they don't do anything. I emailed blu tech support because I thought it was broken, they told me that they just don't work on purpose, I thought that was so stupid that they included then but they don't actually do anything<br/><br/>3 - the camera is pretty good unless it's night or low light, then it's just useless, try to take a picture at a bar or restaurant at n night and you'll just get a black image with some faint outlines of people, my old iphone 3 had a better camera<br/><br/>If you don't care about any of this then it's a great deal, but they could improve this and it would be one of the best phones out there for the money
Hi! I liked it,It's been almost 2 months.Only thing is that the time is not accurate goes fast some times gets a little crazy.if someone can help me with that it will be great.<br/>Thanks.
Best Bang for your dollar on a phablet!  Got 2 on sale for 129.99 each.  For the kids this beats lugging around a tablet.  Resolution is more than adequate,  screen is bright and colors are rich and there is no degradation on angle viewing,  really the display is excellent!  I added 32gb SD cards to make up for the lacking 8GB on-board storage.  Playing games ( primary reason purchased) the hardware has not disappointed.  Sound has been fine on the speakerphone section.  Some have said tinny,  I have not noticed,  playing their games &  or videos the sound had certainly been loud enough and no distortion to note of.  Battery life is excellent so far and the kids have been hammering these things all day long and there's enough to spare come charge time, 20% range... Of course ymmv depending on your own usage.  The phone comes with its own clear case a nice valued addition.  Just a note when charging,  its important to use the supplied usb cord.  Reason,  they have made the male sectioned micro usb connector a tade longer to makeup for the  thickness of the supplied case.  Using one of my own charging cords I found the silicone case pushing it out and charging would stop.  I believe this is what may have given other reviewers an issue in this dept.  All in all if your phone carrier uses GSM technology or your just looking for a phablet to play games,  emails or juat recreational use,  you Cannot go wrong with this phone.  Like I said best bang for the buck.
Works perfect.straightalk.they said it couldn't be activated at first. But some of their reps don't know what their talking about so hang up and call back until you do that's what I did
I can't update the phone. Even when I bought a memory card and tried to update the phone if won't update and it keep freezing like what the hell, I just got this damn phone. Please hell
Great value. Works well and loaded all my Google apps. If a negative, camera function is mediocre and pics are somewhat distorted. If it had a better camera, I would ditch my Samsung.
Lousey audio, can hardly hear in all features!!!! If known how bad would not even think about it. Money down drain video good, audio sorry as h--l. sorry but this phone is no good!!!
This is a great phone.  I have used the iPhones, Galaxy Note series, and this phone can meet or exceed the capabilities of any of them. For the money this phone cannot be beat.
Don't know if its because its a refurb. But I find that I have to reboot my phone once in a while to keep it running smoothly. Besides that Blu phones are OK. This is my second one.
OK, I was a bit surprised by the size, but that's nobody's fault but mine (did not look at the video).  That aside, as we would say in Jamaica (and this is good) DA PHONE YA A DE BESS! IT BAD!! IT TUN UP!!!!  Translation for non-Jamaicans: THIS PHONE IS THE BEST. IT'S REALLY GOOD. IT'S TURNED UP (as in how you would turn up a volume - also meaning it's good).<br/><br/>So far the battery has run for 13-14 hours without charging. Very good for a road warrior. When I use Google Maps however, that drops dramatically to about 6-8 hours depending on how long I use the navigation for.<br/><br/>I find the volume to be low however. My BB Curve 9320 is much louder. Much!<br/><br/>The manual is useless as far as I am concerned, they could have just saved the trees and not printed any, and I am not finding much help online.<br/><br/>I have no problem with my apps, nothing hangs up, so far so good.<br/><br/>I treated myself to this phone me as one of three birthday presents I am giving myself for my upcoming 50th birthday and I am very pleased with this purchase.  For the first time I can leave my Kindle Fire HD at home, especially when I want to carry a smaller handbag.  I am able to do everything from it including my invoicing with INVOICEASAP.
This is a terrific phone for the price.  The integration of the Android OS leaves a lot to be desired but the hardware is solid and the screen is gorgeous.<br/><br/>Hardware: The speakerphone isn't loud enough so I ended up buying a bluetooth mini-speaker for when I use this in class to occasionally Skype in a student.  Yes, the screen (and camera) are good enough for that.  The other issue with the hardware is the location of the earpiece - if you don't get your ear right on that sucker you can't hear anything.  I tend to use a bluetooth headset which works very well.  The processor is fast, the swiping is smooth - all positives.  Adding memory helped a lot.<br/><br/>Software:  I came from Motorola Droid and they really do a great job on making Android work on their phones.  I don't see that same level of integration on the Blu phone but I'm exploring options to enhance the usage via addons.  I wish Cyanogen was available for this phone but I don't see this phone listed on their website.<br/><br/>Would I buy another Blu?  Probably not - unless there is way to overcome these weakness.  But, again, the phone is hundreds of dollars less than most phones with these capabilities so I can live (for now) with a few hesitations.
Great low budget phone! One thing you need is a memory card immediately, can't hold photos & music without it. But if you are looking for value for your money buy this phone.
These are an awesome phone, they do have over the air updates that take it all the way to Android 5.0.2 Lollipop and it works perfectly with it. fast shipping, Great seller
I like this phone, it's HUGE! but what is the best network to use for it because im not getting 3g at all with AT&T; or T-Moblie would it work with Verizon pre-paid plans??
I was nervous when I bought it because I had never heard of BLU but I am very glad that I did. Battery life is outstanding, the display is great. Camera takes great photos. Able to stream Netflix without a hiccup and the movies look great. And I even play games on it with no issue. The OS is pretty much stock Android and is very easy to use. Expand this phone with a 64gb SD, throw a case on it, and you have an mid-top-line phone/tablet that you didn't have to sell a kidney for.<br/><br/>Pro tip: limit the running processes in Android to 3 and the performance of the phone gets even better:<br/>http://www.tomsguide.com/faq/id-2316489/limit-background-process-android-device.html<br/><br/>I'm pretty confident that there is no other phone on the market for this price that has similar features and performance. I liked it so much that I bought the smaller version for my Uncle (who lives overseas...dual SIM/Inernational is perfect for him) and am buying another BLU for my wife to replace her Samsung Galaxy. My co-workers all have said that they're buying these for their kids in place of their pricey iPhones/Galaxy's as well. I have a feeling that BLU will be giving the big players a run for their money.
love the phone in love with the price just the speasker needs to be made louder cant hear calls had to buy a neckband  bluetooth to make calls other than that its awesome
I ordered two of the blu studio 6. 0 phones. One for my husband  and one for myself . I am the business tape with any phone I have.  The phone must be able to keep up with me. Emails, texts, phone calls and etc.  When it comes to my husband,  he is a gamer and the cell phone must be able to keep up with him as well. In one review,  I read that the blu studio 6. 0 was a good phone for games . When he goes to play a game the screen will go black and you have no other choice but to turn the phone off and back on. Not just the games. When he's in a call, the phone will just hang up. For me on the busy side, the keyboard will freeze as if I'm typing too fast! I have to press the screen hard in order to get it to perform a task. The screen will not stay locked when your on a call. Will even press different keys and move apps or change setting on my phone. We love that the blu studio 6. 0 has big screen! In all the phone was good for it's size for my husband and I  but it's just not working for us. :( . Will be sending them back based on the defects with the phone. On another note, I am trying the blu studio 5 HD and it's doing really gooe so far.  Reminds me a lot of my Samsung galaxy s3.
Was a great phone for a week, then it just died. Would not power on anymore. I'm glad i bought it thru Amazon and not Ebay. Atleast I can send it back for a refund.
Not a good phone low phone volume,gets really hot when charging and screen gets stuck on Chinese words, don't buy this phone. The look and size of phone is decent!
Love, love love this phone. I came from a galaxy three and this phone is a breath of fresh air. I decided to buy one for a friend because i SO love this phone. :)
this phone exceeded my expectations. Got for my mom, i played with it for two days and it almost made me pick it over the note 4. she uses it with Straight Talk.
Loved the phone then the screen just cracked out of no where and screen stopped being reponsive which sucked would be nice if it had gorilla glass on the screen
I bought this phone for three reasons. Reason 1: The 6" hd screen. Bigger than the Iphone 6 plus or the new Galaxy 6. Reason Two: The price. Less than $200 delivered! Reason 3: the overwhelming majority of positive reviews.<br/><br/>I activated this phone on 3/17/15. So far, no major problems. The controls take a little getting use to and I'm not a fan of the non removable battery. The battery life on a full charge is impressive. The call quality and speaker quality is good No one has complained about not hearing me.<br/><br/>I use this phone mostly for entertainment. YouTube and Netflix are my favorite channels and they play GREAT on this phablet!<br/><br/>A word of caution to those on limited data plans. Since I activated this phone my data usage has skyrocketed. Almost 25 GB in less than a month. And to those who asked about why this phone won't work on Verizon. Verizon has a device centric network that covers 97 % of the nation. But only their devices can work on that network. Other carriers are Sim card based. I like that this is a dual Sim card phone. Perfect for those who like to lead a double life. Lol.
Whenever you turn the phone on, Chinese writing appears on screen and it is difficult to remove it.After just a few weeks the phone fell and stopped working.
i love it the voicemail is tricky but it is really nice having a "Bare OS" android phone no bs clogging it up and the screen resolution is just great
Overall I'd say the phone is...okay. I'm an iPhone owner and bought this thing to use overseas or if I ever break or lose my main phone.<br/>I'm in Japan using this phone now.<br/>1) Response time: 2/5 - i press on an app's icon and it doesn't load up straight away, sometimes 2-5 seconds for it to react. Touch screen isn't sensitive, but I'm assuming it's because it's resistive as opposed to capacitive touch screen.<br/>2) Functionality: 4/5 - does everything the iPhone does. Google maps doesn't show which direction I'm pointing at though and the GPS overall doesn't function or feel like it has the function of "real time" tracking. I had it turned on while I was on the bus and while I was walking...it didn't update as frequently as I'm used to on the iPhone.<br/><br/>Camera is okay...not a very smooth or fast response time with that either.<br/><br/>Obviously I don't expect this to match up with an iPhone or a high end android phone. It works for what I need it for. Right now I'm using its wifi hot spot feature, putting it in my backpack and tethering my iPhone to it for the Internet.
The phone was what I expected but the camera doesn't work.I have to reset the phone in order for the camera to work.But other then that its a great phone..
I love the phone but not the volume. The ring tone is not loud. When talking on the phone both sides can't hear good. Even if speaker on I can't hear good.
I've had this phone for a little over a week now and let me tell you, it is awesome. It's bigger than the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and it's performance is way better. I am big into technology and this phone has everything I desired for a good price. I was skeptical at first from reading a few of the bad reviews on Amazon but after playing around with the Blu Studio 6.0 HD I can honestly say I have nothing bad to say about it. I use Walmart Family Mobile and the simcard fit right in and was good to go without any other adjustments needed. It uses a regular sim card and has a slot for a 2nd one which I dont use. The 4G works great and I can download apps and use the internet at incredible speeds. The volume sounds low on calls I noticed when you have the phone on silent. This doesnt bother me though when I turn the ringer volume up and then make a call the sound is loud and no problems! I am very impressed by Blu. I ordered another phone from them for my wife which is the Blu 5.0c studio phone and it is awesome as well on the Family Mobile sim.<br/><br/>Good job Blu I am a loyal customer now!
Love this phone, feel like I came from a Yogo to an BMW.. Volume is a little low, however the pros exceeds the cons. You could never beat it for the price
Its broked in less than three months and the customer service does not answer. After much work we send the unit for repair for a month and had no answer.
I love the size but the charger doesn't fit right so it doesn't always charge and the volume is way to low you cant hear someone on the phone full volume
I'm a fan!  It's really hard to beat the value this phone offers.  I got this phone fully intending it to be a placeholder device while I switched carriers. When I realized that the phone was cheaper than the deductible to replace my iPhone, it just made sense.  Now; however, I must admit that I am really impressed by this device.  The screen is amazing.  On T-Mobile, it's incredibly fast.<br/><br/>I'm now even more excited to purchase the LTE version of this phone in the next few weeks.  I will definitely keep this as a backup device, but it has served me especially well as my main phone.<br/><br/>The only reason I did not give this phone 5 stars was because there is a little bit of "glitchiness" (not a real word but you know what I mean) with how the phone seems to handle certain apps.  It has crashed on my more than once, but the restoration was painless.  I can say that the latest update seems to have helped.  For me personally, the pros far outweigh the cons with this dividend it is more that n worth every single cent.
the pictures are really good, but the volume is very low, the speaker don't work, the notification light no work, and you can hear your owen voice
tbh this came on time started out great and then couple days after it crashed and not taking charge and i actually loved the size of the phone :(
This phone is great for just about anything - it is somewhere in-between a tablet and an iPhone, so the kids have been using it for games, in addition to general phone use. I don't think the camera/video quality is all that hot. The quality of the images on the phone are fantastic though - colors are vibrant and the images are crisp.  If you listen to music through a phone - I prefer a proper sound system - you might not be that thrilled.  The sound quality is weak. When played through a remote speaker, however, the sound improves a little. I personally find the larger size of the phone to be a bit bothersome - I like the smaller size of my iPhone much better. All in all, this is a nice phone that reflects current trends in personal phones - they seem to be getting larger. For the person that needs a no-nonsense phone to simply make calls, this may be a bit much.  However, for those people that use the phone for recording videos, playing games, accessing the internet, in addition to making calls, this really is a nice phone.
It is a good phone I like it because I am unable to purchase the samsung phone that I like this phone helps me the only thing its volume is low
Love it my friends all have Galaxy Notes etc., didn't want a contract and was being cheap but this thing doesn't perform of feel cheap at all!!
I bought this phone on Septemer 9th & got it on the 11th. I put in an order for a replacement on the 14th because the speakers malfunctioned. When I would make calls and the volume was turned all the way up, some calls I could hear, some calls I couldnt hear and other calls were so loud it was distorted. Same with the outer speaker for listening to music and videos and whatnot. Then my replacement came in, and the same issues with the speaker. Just not as bad. So now Im just convinced these phones are just built with very low end speakers. Other than that though, its a great phone. Good size, amazing screen resolution for a cheap price, comes with KitKat but is uprgradeable to Lollipop which is what I did right away. Some people may like this phone better on KitKat as Ive noticed it started moving a tad slower once Lollipop was installed. It has its days though. I used a standard sized sim card for straight talk that was at&t; compatible but you can also use a micro sim as long as you put it in an adapter.
I LOVE the big screen! It doesn't have many features of other phones. But as long as the basics work, I'm good. Its a 'basic' phone but huge!
Great phone ! Love it! Only issue is the touch is not 100% sensitive as it should be.I'll never psy 4-$600 for a phone ever with blu around!
The phone was not brand new as stated on the website. It was a waste of my time. Personally I would not trust buying a phone on any website
I love the phone. I've  had it for over 2 months. The battery life is awesome. I mostly watch Netflix and the picture is abolsoluelyawesome
Nice big and bright screen. I am very satisfied with my purchase. The loudness of the internal speaker is on the low side of the spectrum.
I ordered this phone after seeing it on youtube, this phone is fantastic because the size of the screen and the price, the screen is very clear and bright and most importantly colorful. I went to Walmart and got the family mobile plan that only cost me 26 dollars after tax for my first mouth pre paid plan unlimited everything, at the end of the day I had a bargain on my phone and my plan. If your thinking of getting this phone I personally think you should, if you really want to save money get the phone and the Walmart family plan because why have a lengthy contact and overage fees when you can have pre paid on a big hd 6 inch smartphone! Everyone thinks I paid about 600 dollars for my phone and you know what! I just let them keep thinking it when they bring their Samsung Galaxy Note 4 around me to only let the notice my screen is bigger than theirs a my screen is more brighter, you can have this same experience but you can never pursue your own happiness if you procrastinating.
Amazing so far, I found the phone in store for 399, so 128 is a steal, battery lasts, screens awesome, SLIM asf, and sound quality is A-1
Pros - 1) Large screen 2) the charge plug is located on the top of the phone makes it a little easier when using the phone while plugged in 3) Good affordable price<br/><br/>Cons - 1) the volume is not good at all, the speaker phone sounds like what my Samsung G3 sounded like when the speaker was off, for me the volume is the worst feature on this phone. Perhaps, my phone is defective but the sound is really low and I have great hearing. 2) sometimes you have to repeatedly touch the app or whatever it is you are trying to open 2 or 3 times before the phone responds to your touch but not too often., 3) I know that I said the size is a pro but it's also a con if you are coming from a smaller phone, the size takes some getting used to.<br/><br/>Overall, all of my apps that I regularly used (Pandora, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, etc.) all work great on this phone. I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and I like it. I got it for a reasonable price $150.00.
I'm pretty pleased with this phone. When I took it out of the box, I was surprised with how large the phone is. I guess some people call it a "phalet", which is a cross between a phone and a tablet". It takes a little used to holding it, especially by your ear, but I'm fine with it.<br/><br/>Technical details of electronics  go right over my head, so I won't go into the specific technical details of the phone. But I will say that the setup was incredibly easy. Even the least technical person can easily work and figure out this phone. It comes with a screen protector, which is great. It's easy to hook the phone to Wi-fi and websites work well on the phone. The picture quality on Youtube is excellent. The audio quality is not the best but I'm okay with it.<br/><br/>It's easy to make a phone call and I could hear the other person just fine,; no static on my end. Overall, I'm extremely happy with this phone and hopefully you will be too.
So I've had this phone for about 2 days and over all I like but there are a few things that are driving me crazy for one the GPS freaking sucks it constantly forces close and when its working it doesn't even show the correct spot I'm in on the map that's a huge problem for me because I rely on GPS a lot two people keep telling me there not receiving my picture msgs another huge problem I share a lot of pics three I live in Cleveland and its the middle of winter so I rely on touch screen gloves when I'm out and about for some reason they don't work on this phone and its not the gloves I've tried it on other phone and they work fine  I haven't found anything else bad....yet but that's a lot for just two days but I will say for the price its pretty good great picture great size and it does most of the things androids do will write another review in the next couple weeks to see if its a good fit for me or not but I won't lie I am thinking of returning
The look of the phone is beautiful but I can't change the font, some apps aren't supported, icons are super huge and the camera sucks
Not a bad phone screen is great. Took a bit to get used to the way the settings are set up on this phone compared to the Samsung Galaxy s3 I had before this. Issues I have with the phone is I love playing games on it and some games are not compatable with it. The game that I do play a lot for some odd reason sometimes when I start the app the phone reboots. That gets really frustrating. The battery life is okay seems to be getting worse already and iv only had the phone for three months. (Can not replace it either battery is built into the phone). Also the speaker is not loud at all. If there is any background noise at all you can not hear it.<br/><br/>Other than that the phone works great.<br/>Voice command is awesome<br/>Fast processor<br/>Decent camera<br/>Display is great.<br/>Seems pretty durable for how big it is<br/>Bluetooth works great<br/><br/>Don't really know what else to say besides it was worth the money but its no note 4.
The screen is crazy huge I love it, the phone def gives the notes a run for their money sometimes the screen lags if you have a lot of apps open but nothing to extreme its very rare that that even happens its no where near a deal breaker trust me I did a lot of reviews and videos on this phone before I bought it but this phone is absolutely awesome and for the price you can't beat it!! I'm currently through T-Mobile this phone works with basically any carrier who has a Sim card and it has 2 Sim card slots as well so if you want to do dual companies you can  only downfall there's really no good protecting phone cases for these just yet but definitely use the one that comes with it bc I've owned mine for a month now and trust me due to the size you can easily drop it but I'm very satisfied my husband is very picky with phones and its beyond exceeded his expectations and he's very happy with the phone so if your debating don't debate get it!!!
I got this as a replacement phone for my other BLU phone (Life play x) which had been great until the charger port stopped working. I managed to luck out again and get a faulty charger port in this phone as well. The charging port still works, it just needs a little jiggle. The battery itself is not user replaceable (shame), and I have noticed a weird occurance; occasionally when you plug it in to charge, it will charge EXTREMELY quick. Like, you can watch the percentage go up and you can get a full çrge in less than ten minutes. But, after that awesome charge, the next time you plug it in, it won't charge at all. It will say it is, and it will have the little charging symbol, but no matter how long it is on there it won't charge back up.<br/><br/> I'm terribly disappointed and hope that this isn't the norm for BLU phones. My first one was amazing! I do suppose they have to skimp somewhere to achieve such a good priced phone.
Great performance!
Worked with annoying but minor problems for six months, went black one day for no reason never came back on. Don't buy this phone.
Good phone, but has it flaws. The voice quality is very poor on loud speaker, indication light not working on the one I received.
Got 2 of these phones for my boys they love them not one bad thing to say about these phones best phones ever and best price ever
BLU Studio 6.0 HD:<br/>So i just got it today, so i cant write a great review on the performance but the look is GREAT!  The screen is big and camera is niiice. I do not want to pay $500 or more for a good phone so im glad blu phones are now available. Im young depending on your perspective (25) but i am also clumsy/forgetful i dont want to loose or break a phone i paid SO much money for! So this is a great option. I had a different blu phone for a while, it  was more inexpensive and not as good as a Samsung obviously. The only thing that bothered me was that it took a couple taps to get to the messages, half the time, a glitch im sure, but for the price it wasnt bad. Cant comment yet if this phone has the same problem (or others) BUT if thats the only problem i would glady buy another! Have to get a sim adapter only other problem so far but im glad i bought it and will write another review after a few weeks of use.
Great phone, wonderful service, outstanding companies, Amazon and BREED. One of my best long term relationships. Thank you all.
Make sure you know this is a phablet(phone/tablet mix). It's really big for a phone. I can't imagine it will be easy to carry around(within pockets/hands). I've showed it to a couple of people, and the response: "Wow!", with big eyes. It's perfect if you want a small tablet!<br/><br/>My husband mainly tried this phone out. I've had trouble hearing him on his other cell phones, and actually heard him better with this one, so I'm going to say the sound is a plus. The display is great, also, and bright.<br/><br/>There are 2 spots for SIM cards, so that took a bit of figuring out to get one in there correctly. It was only after a bit of research that we realized the benefit of having spots for 2 sim cards. (You can swap back and forth if overseas to get the best price on calls. Since we've never been overseas, we haven't tested this out.)<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great phablet for the price!
I've had this phone just a few days, so I'll have to update this review in a few months. Overall, really cool phablet, but (ya knew it was coming)... the protective skin that comes w/ the phone makes it impossible to recharge (top). There's not enough space for the charger male end to fit securely into the phone's charging port. I have to remove the skin to recharge the phone. BTW, the recharging cord is pretty short. I suppose the designers assumed you'd be plugged into a computer close by.  The user manual is practically useless & English is on the back page, not front. I went to BLUproducts.com to see if a more detailed manual exited. They didn't even list this phone as a product or support.  Lastly, the phone is quite big in your hand. I'm relearning to use it w/2 hands. Ok, I don't want to kill the enthusiasm, b/c otherwise, I'm enjoying the speed, clarity, functions,etc. of this phone so far.
Well I hope this helps someone first I thank God for Amazon and great Prices I have been the person to always believe that name brand was everything until I found this company called blu just bought the blue Studio HD 6.0 and man first impression Great device and Quality for the Price I have had the Samsung line of phones for a while the note 2,galaxy 3, and I bought them because of the name and Quality but this American company from Florida called blu is giving great prices to the consumer and Quality that can compare to Samsung or any other high end device.Blu Studio 6.0 is great 720p the Screen is Massive good colors,dual sim,I have made decision I am dedicated to Blu continue tobring great phones for great Prices.Who ever gets this yout wont be dissappointed:-)
the first and second unit arrives doa. thats right it would not power on or charge, just dead. this is the second one in two weeks.<br/><br/>update: 07/13/2015<br/>new phone arrived today and would not power on or charge, so i left it alone for about an hour or so, now works. must have been completely dead. so far its working fine, ill update if any changes.<br/><br/>update: 07/20/2015<br/>still working fine, after the return and new phone i will give this unit  five stars. it works great and the return process was done with great professionalism.
PLEASE DO NOT MAKE A MISTAKE<br/>I bought this phone for about $140 in June 2015 at first the phone looked good, but I noticed that the soft touch was not fast.<br/> Barely 3 months later the soft touch gradually became unresponsive in 2 weeks, I was pathetic and stranded the phone was completely useless to me I contacted BLU, and after trying to fix it electronically, I had to ship it to them for repairs. Guess what? I was terribly shocked when I was told that a new phone which I just purchased was out of warranty because of a simple scratch on screen which resulted because I took off the screen shield out of frustration to cut the long story short, I spent an additional $20 getting it back unrepaired. I FELT REALLY BAD AT THE END, BECAUSE I WAS WARNED BEFORE BUYING. PLEASE DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE<br/>I
Overall a solid affordable phone. I has dual sim which is nice and all but you do have to understand its major downfall is being a cheap phone. Its fast enough for me although my friends claim its slow and not as fluid. They're privileged with having 800-900 dollar phones though and this is the most expensive phone I've ever owned. It works much better after you update Android and it seems to fix some camera artifacting that way as well. The one Huge con for me about this phone is that it lacks wifi calling. So while the signal was great near the city of Chicago where i live, T-mobile's non existent service in my college town in the middle of no where has forced me to move back to my 30 dollar walmart purchased phone so that I can simply use it in this damn town with wifi calling. All in all a great purchase as long as you can get signal from your carrier wherever you are.
Love  my phone....  I Had it about one week.... Everybody wants one... Now I'm waiting on my case to arrive tomorrow....
Excellent phone!!! I have had it around three weeks and so far no problems. Its the perfect size and has a good camera.
The phone shot off and to start is going to the original program in chine language and I do not know Chines language.
Solid phone, fantastic deal for the price. Have used this for about 6 months, and still working great with the battery lasting longer than ever. Not the speediest phone out there, but does the job and has a huge screen.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>* great price for all the features<br/>* recent upgrade to 5.0 fixed crashing, extended battery life considerably<br/>* good camera for such a low price<br/>* essentially stock Android, so very compatible with a apps in the Google play store<br/>* microSD slot for easy memory upgrade<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>* a little sluggish at times, but not awful. Works for Minecraft but may be slow for real-time action games<br/>* touch display responds slowly, especially for swipe typing- go too fast and you get gibberish<br/>* GPS only gives position, not direction. Can't see what direction you're pointing on maps, and Google sky map doesn't work<br/>* headset that comes with it is garbage<br/>* minor annoyance: the charger port is set a little deep, so many other android chargers I have don't stick in it
Had hard time hearing the call even on speaker phone.No volume it's a better tablet then phone.I sent back 2 phones.
I cannot say enough about this phone it is awesome a lot of features the only drawback that I have with it is they send you a little manual that doesn't scratch the surface of what this phone is capable of doing I wish the company would give you a more detail manual with this phone but they don't but if you're interested in a phone I compare it to any of the phones the iPhone's samsung galaxy megaphones these phones if you bought outright is around  500 to 1000 dollars for these phones this phone has a feature that most phones don't it comes unlocked from the factory with dual SIMs for about $200.00 what I paid for you can't beat that I would recommend this phone to anybody but if you're not used to a big phone it take some time to get used to
Works well based on its capabilities. Handling is an issue but that takes tweaking. All in all it is a good buy.
Phone works great but back camera stopped working I tried everything even reset the phone it still doesn't work.
problems, problems, problems. I like the size, so I may try this model again, Sometimes you just get a lemon.
the battery in the phone does not hold charge. i fully charged the phone prior to first use but when i power up the phone the battery went down very quickly; like within four hours and the phone got very hot. on another day i put the  battery to charge after it went down to red and within seven minutes the battery was fully charged, this is really bad because its a built in battery so its not like you can just replace the battery. without a good holding battery the phone would be useless since it needs the battery power to keep it going. it is also very annoying because you cant run a video or watch a movie online without having on the charger, but apart from this, its a very nice cheap phone for a low budget.<br/>does anyone else has this problem with the battery.
Why can't my phone turn on?  Why wont it charge. Just got my phone 15 minutes ago and it won't do anything
Good phone for the money it is really big which I love and battery life is great for as much as I use it.
I’ve had this thing for about a month now and for the price it really cannot be beat. It’s not a top of the line model but performs great for my uses. I use both the sim slots (one for home (Straight Talk) and one for work (AT&T;), movies look great, all the features work as expected. Most surprising of all is that it actually runs GTA Vice City… A little touchy but runs it most of the time. The only negative I have is probably a setting I haven’t been able to locate. When I’m driving down the street it constantly sounds the WiFi chime which is the same as the text. On the other had it must have great WiFi reception. Bottom line is that I am so impressed I think Blu has a new customer and I am highly recommending their products to friends and coworkers.
Love the phone except when it is on speaker phone the column isn't very loud so u cannot hear too good
I wasn't too pleased with this phone. Its very nice for the price and when i opened it, i couldnt wait to take it to my carrier (metropcs) and get it all setup. After i got it set up. I got my first call. Omg, i could barley hear the people on the other end, it was hella distorted, my signal was horrible which didnt happen with my metro phone prior to this one. It says 4G but the internet/data never stayed on. I wanted a big phone but this one was a lil too big. The plus side to it is the camera was AMAZING. After playing with this phone a bit, it seemed to me to be setup just like the ZTE MAX. I just couldnt deal with the hassel so i sent it back today. Two days was enough for me to know i was unhappy. Hope others have better luck.
Loved it at first, big fancy looking phone. Takes great pictures. Plenty of storage space. I love Google so androids are my go to phones. Only problem after owning it less than two months, I dropped it and the screen cracked some. I thought that's ok I'll just have to use it with a few cracks. When I tried to unlock the phone, the touch wouldn't work! Turns out the screen digitizer and LCD are fused and would need a new set of those all together. Needless to say I bought a cheaper phone instead of paying $145 to get it fixed. That's more than I paid for the phone! Awesome phone but once it cracks 😭 P.S. My hubby also had one and cracked just by sitting on it in his pocket. Crack was barely visible and it stopped working as well.
Here's the thing- I love this phone- a lot-<br/>I think the display is amazing- and it does pretty much everything I need.<br/><br/>However- I have had it for around 1 month- and the screen has frozen with light, and even the power button would not restart the phone.<br/><br/>UPDATE!!****<br/><br/>AND- there was I think two times, when the phone restarted and I saw Chinese characters come up NOT GOOD. Not my language.<br/><br/>Clearly this is very fudged up- It makes you wonder exactly how long the phone will work.....not a good sign after 30-40 days??!!<br/>So- If this phone keeps working and stays ok- then I'll be very happy with it.<br/><br/>However, if the screen keeps blacking out and chinese letters keep appearing...I won't be happy about it.<br/><br/>So- I guess. It's alright for now.<br/><br/>Updating a litte bit-----<br/><br/>This phone has irritated me a couple ways...<br/><br/>Like I told you- Chinese characters at random times.<br/><br/>Screen freeze with light....you just have to wait for it to restart on its own.<br/>The battery is internal so you can't remove it to cut the power and put it back in...<br/><br/>The on/off on the right if you hold it....would not even restart.<br/><br/>Battery life is not that great.<br/><br/>I'm not watching videos all day long...<br/>Navigation will kill the battery life in close to an hour...<br/>The screen is huge....and I love it...I love the phone...but<br/>these small things are adding up to me getting a little irritated.<br/><br/>Battery life not that great...at all.<br/>Random restarts...and<br/>processer clogs and lags...which I've had on other android phones,<br/>but when will this glitch get out of these phones...<br/>it's when you are typing and the phone freezes for 5 seconds...and you can't write.<br/>Then all the letters you typed flood in at once....small things...<br/>but- with it's HUGE processor...I don't want that to happen.<br/>And it does...daily.<br/>When you dial a number...<br/>type in the notebook.....<br/>it's just a little irritating....and I have patience.<br/><br/>Call me crazy, but when you buy a new phone...it would be nice if it worked WELL<br/>for a little while.<br/><br/>I'm not throwing in the towel by any means...<br/>I'm not giving up on this phone.<br/><br/>I also turn off wifi and bluetooth when not in use...I always terminate<br/>those extra things that drain power....but still-<br/><br/>Battery is not that great. Going to have to carry around the charger<br/>I guess for the next couple years...<br/><br/>This phone better start to behave, or I will come back and have<br/>further news to report to you, my fellow reviewers.<br/><br/>I am hoping for the best.....I had really high hopes for this phone...<br/>It's just these little things....and I am so sick of phones with bad battery life...<br/>it's so annoying....I just need the phone to last for a FULL day of use...<br/>whatever it is ...navigation...internet....sirius radio app...etc..<br/>I want to use the phone...and then<br/>I will plug it in at night....so...design a battery that lasts for a day and a half...<br/><br/>I hope that happens...in the future....<br/>I have yet to have a phone with battery life that I was ok with...<br/><br/>Hope this helps if you are deciding about this phone.<br/>Understand that you may have these issues too....maybe not.
This is a great phone:  I get about 3 days on a charge, it is fast, it allows apps to be run from the SD card which frees internal space, it takes good pictures and video and is ready to use fast, and it is large enough to functionally use for social media and reading anything of interest.  Connecting it with my Pebble Smartwatch is ideal, allowing the phone to store until needed or wanted while I read notifications on my watch.  Together with the Pebble it is a perfect system.  The only shortcoming has been the low audio I have noticed in videos made with the included video camera. However, Vine video and others all have perfect audio. So it could be an aberration. This is the best android phone I have every used!
I bought this phone, and had to send the first one back to amazon for a replacement because the screen response was horrible. This is why I took a star. The new phone, my replacement is AMAZING. Touch screen response is perfect, screen clear and crisp, apps and web browsing just as fast or faster than my old galaxy.<br/><br/>While I have three blu phones since the new year, one 5.5 and two 6.0, and both of my first two messed up, screen flickering issue and screen response, I would recommend. I think they need to work out the kinks with a few models and the screen issues though. So if you have an issue, report it to amazon and take advantage of the return/exchange policy! Blu  will NOT replace it, merely repair.
I am owning this phone from a week now and have found this to be absolutely amazing. Huge 6 inches screen with some really nice colors is a big plus.<br/><br/>Dual sim is an added advantage and as soon as i put the SIM in it worked smoothly no hassles, even 4G speed is not a let off. All apps and normal games are working smoothly without any lag.<br/><br/>Only 2 Cons with this phone is its in-built 8 GB memory, could have been a little better and Camera have been sightly better but its still worth the money that is spent.<br/><br/>BLU also provides a screen protector and mobile case which is again a good sign that manufacturer wants to invest in its customer base.<br/><br/>So a THUMBS UP for this product.
blu 6.0 HD is another "exciting" cell phone purchase for me, where I spend some hours gazing at Chinese writing after phone resets itself. I am turning into some kind of "Chinese writing" freak. It looks like exotic, colorful art put inside my phone, so I have something interesting to gaze upon, while trying to get the phone out of reset mode. Look, take something and delicately free the side buttons on the device of the TOO TIGHT "FREE" RUBBERY COVER which is pressing on the buttons causing the phone to "hard reset". The "reset" process is accomplished the EXACT way the ill fitting cover is pressing on device. I am getting excellent 4G data on this device. Good internet.
So i know you are reading through all reviews youll see bad reviews that make you not wanna buy the phone ( which is rare) and good ones like mine. I love my phone I can keep it forever I got it in the color black I paid 203 all together including tax it can go for any company and good part is you don't have to put any down payments to any of the companies you have cause you bought the phone online . also it comes with a 1 year warranty so if anything happens to your phone it can be fixed or if lost replaced . one thing I can say is this is a big phone that needs a case strong enough so that it doesn't break also one con is the volume is horrible . it should be just a Lil louder since the phone is big but not
With the exception of the ear piece volume. I've had no problem. Had to down load a volume booster
LOVE IT!! great battery, great scree, great everything. It's big but it's exactly what I wanted ☺
I love this phone ...got for  $88.50 ...for that price it's definitely worth the money and more
Phone is great but I cannot find a cover to fit it so keep that in mind if u decide to buy one.
Sound low and unclear.<br/>Can hear caller, but caller cannot hear me.<br/>Takes nice picture
Pros:<br/>  Nice large 6" screen which is perfect for my hands.<br/>  Dual sim works very well.<br/>  Battery life is great especially on standby.<br/>  Responsiveness of apps is very good.<br/>  Price is very  reasonable<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>  Screen protector did not stick on properly.<br/>  Sound quality is horrible when receiving or making calls. I had to ask people to keep repeating what they said which is unacceptable to me.<br/><br/>It is too bad that the call sound quality is so poor as I had to return it to Amazon just for that reason. I ordered a new more expensive smartphone from Amazon (i.e. Sony Xperia Z3 dual Sim model) which I hope to receive soon.
Phone is amazing for the price. It's fast, the screen colors are brite and wonderful. Camera takes great pics to. Just as good as a high end over priced contract phone the major carriers have. Only reason I gave it a 4 is the speakers didn't work but could hear and talk with the head phones. Amazon is sending me another one free two day shipping and I will do another review to make it a 5 ounce I recieve it. I would recommend this phone to everyone. People have said the free case they send with it doesn't fit correctly but my wife and I both got this phone and it fits wonderfully. Blu has a amazing product line that is going to give the big companies a run for their money.
I was expecting this phone very intense, when it came my first impression was: too big! It looks like a tablet! But instead of that the phone is amazing! It came without charge and when I turned on it I was like a DOS antique display. After that I remembered one review from here about that and I let it charge or a while, and voilà! When I turned on was nice, the display is super clear and the phone works perfectly! My Sim was accepted OK even thought I'm in the Dominican Republic, and was the Sim from my old phone from my local carrier. The only thing I have seen is the sound of the phone is king of low. But in general this phone is a very good product. I love it!
The phone works perfectly however a week after I receive it the charger stopped working....
slow, screen is no very responsive, both SIM card slots are standard size. not recommended.
Battery says 1%... Plug the phone in and two seconds later it's at 100%... Garbage battery.
Good Price, Big Screen, Easy use, Easily connected to Net10 by insterting my sim card and updating the APN settings. Pretty quick. Camera and storage could be better, but is acceptable and upgradable with price. Overall loving it so far apart from a couple deal breakers:<br/><br/>Had several dead pixels the night I used the Camera, that have been fixed recently. dont know how, they just did. Also: It does NOT read my 64gb Micro SD card. The description clearly says it reads up to 64 Gb, but Mine did not. Could depend on the type/speed/brand of Micro SD, but Mine didn't, and that made me super bummed as I was going to use it to review my Sony action cam vids.
You can't hear nothing without the ear buds.. Not happy with this phone at all
"You get what you paid for" . I bought this item on March 23 and I already have issues with the microphone. No one can hear me when I'm calling. It worked perfectly for the first month but now ( 2 months later) it is all damaged. I haven't given it a bad treatment . I use it as any other cellphone , but it has such a bad quality that it also overheats when I open the navigator for more than  5 minutes. I'm so sad because I really liked the screen but I guess I'll have to spend another bunch of money on getting a new phone, but definitely not  this one. I do not recommend this device to anyone expecting good performance and durability.
its a nice phone ..good quality, however it slows up a bit when to much app are opened .
internet does not work on it ,,, and speaker phone causes other people to hear feedback
I got this phone for my grandson an he loves it exceeds all expections for the price!!!
Simply the best phone I ever ever have had up to date! buy it asap you won't regret it.
Had a scare as soon as we got it. It locked up. It would only vibrate once when you tried to turn it on. Thought the battery might be dead so we plugged in the charger and tried again. It said the battery was at 44% but still wouldnt come on.<br/><br/>We left it on the charger for a couple hours and tried again. It came on and has worked fine ever since (5 days now). Not sure what that was all about. If that is the worst problem we have with it, I will be extremely happy with this purchase. I love the phone. Huge screen, great colors, and really fast. Not too impressed with the camera quality, but not really that important to me.
This phone is fantastic until the screen breaks.  The first time I dropped it in a parking lot (5 days after I bought it).  Ok - my bad.  On the second time, a hair-line crack appeared for no reason.<br/><br/>On all of my Samsung phones, when a hairline crack appeared, the screen would still work.  That is NOT true on this phone.  The tiniest of cracks and you can't do anything with the screen anymore.  Also, the glue they use on the digitizer is super strong, so you can't replace the glass without paying $100 for a new complete LCD display.  Sucks.
been using it since dec 19 2014, i took it to warranty because i blocked it and it never woke up from it, this is going to be the 3rd time it fails and thanks to warranty they give me another new, but this 3rd time i got sick of it, i dont want a new phone i want it to be working fine, when the warranty finish in dec. i dont know what im going to do if it dies again.probably going to buy another brand. i have 3 work partners which buyed the blu 5.0 and the blu 7 and they all changed cellphone more that twice due to bad quality. sorry blu your phones are defective, is a shame because you gave me all i needed i wish it lasted more
Received this phone about 6 days ago, so far I'm loving this phone. Its back camera takes nice pictures, its running pretty much stock android, so the 1.3 GHz quad core processor makes this thing run as smooth as butter, display is nice, not the best but nothing to complain about AT ALL!! I was pretty impressed with the design, its much thinner than I expected it to be and it fills pretty good in the hand, I'd suggest you buy a case for it because it can be a bit slippery. In all, I'd definitely suggest potention buyers to purchase this item, oh and I'd advise you to purchase a simcard adapter kit also, costs about 4$ on amazon
The phone dies in two week I try to sent it back but they say that the Warranty was up
It's a good phone clean clear pictures but camera not so good and battery dies quickly
I am totally please with my new phone and it has met all if my expectations and more.
Let me start with what's good - bright screen, decent performance, ok battery life.<br/>Now the bad - terrible camera, fuzzy, lacks definition, muted colors. Terrible internet browser performance - problem opening some sites, lack of intuitive navigation functions. Poor call volume and quality. Cheap, glossy plastic back that's a smudge magnet and scratch magnet. Thought I got a good deal but, compared to my Nokia Windows phone, this is a pathetic phone that don't come close to the Nokia in terms of quality and usability. I bought it thinking that the larger screen would make up for the lower specs, but NO WAY!
No it is not the latest and greatest apple  I-phone , but I love all the extra money in my pocket, just follow the advice on the other reviews about charging the battery, so far my charges have lasted as long as my Samsung galaxy 5.  As others have noted, pictures--- not so good, but Samsung Galaxy 5 take pictures out of this world. Definitely a cost savings of about 70 % over my Samsung , which is currently under a plan.<br/>so far the GPS has been just fine, have not had a chance to try it out any where but near some though.  Great value for the money, and it is brand new.  Love bigger screen!!!!!!
The phone is great... the only yhing is that I ordered it black and it came white
a fair phone with very good display but the volume on the receiver is very poor.
I previously owned the Blu Studio 5.0, which I loved, but this is a major improvement.  The screen looks great and the cameras are improved, though obviously not perfect.  This isn't Samsung, so if you are looking for a high-end phone, be ready to shell out high-end dollars.  But for the money spent, this is an AMAZING deal.  One negative is the sound quality of actual phone calls; I recommend a Bluetooth headset for talking on the phone as it can be difficult to hear at times.  I use mine more for texting and apps than talking, so not a big deal for me.  Overall, I love this device.
It's a really good phone,  but it is not compatable woth straight talk!  It says it is but it's not.  I just wasted $65,  which is not refundable,  because this site lied to me.<br/><br/>*UPDATE*<br/>Forget what I said. This is complatable with straight talk. The guy at Walmart was an idiot. He said it was not and I came home and worked with it a little online and now it works.<br/>*UPDATE*<br/>I've had this phone for about a week now and the microphone has stopped working. I am utterly disappointed. I want my money back.
The phone has great battery life. Great screen with vivid colors. Takes pretty good pics outdoors, but not so great inside. The physical size of the phone is enormous. Coming from a samsung note I assumed this wouldn't be a big issue, but this phone is actually larger. The biggest drawback is the speed of the phone, and that was the deal breaker for me. On countless occasions, this machine would lag badly and freeze. Navigating through apps was quite a chore. What made this a bit easier to deal with was an app killer from the android store. For the price its not a terrible phone.
I really like this phone! I cant say love it... I've owned two; a 5.5 and the 6.0HD. the 5.5 had problems with the speaker and the charger port loosened up quickly ad broke after 40 days. the 6.0 seems to be going along the lies of the 5.5..... you can barely hear during a voice call and the charger port is loose. as for the rest you cant beat them for this price the wifi hooks up quick the Bluetooth  works great. ( I would suggest a pair of SB214 Sylvania Bluetooth headphones... about 20 bucks from amazon) I really would like to see them fix that charger port and phone speaker.
Already is having hardware problems after three months of buying it. It has problems with network connections on most apps, some fixable, some not. Also has the classic problem of a phone having 8 gigs of storage but it wants to store everything on a full data card by default. Call quality is fine, audio quality is fine, the camera works very well. Do not underestimate the dimensions, this is a big phone.<br/><br/>It's not for me but you might like it if you just need a basic phone to access facebook and the like, I seem to be the only one having this random hardware problem.
awesome beautiful phone 720p screen 6 inch phone, case that it comes with sucks also the charging cable they are pretty much not compatible the cases holes dont fit some earphones or charging cables and the charging cable you need to wiggle it to charge this phone, the earphones it comes with are awesome tho long lasting still use them after 4 months or so lol careful tho this phone is not even 4g nor 3g its more like 2g edge speed i connected to two different services but the speed is always slow my old 3g phone has faster internet than this even with all the correct settings
It's a nice phone. It won't let you do all the latest updates.  I took everything off my cell to make room and it still won't update to the new up date it says I have.  The charge port suck. You have to hold it a special way to get it to charge.  I tried different chargers along with the one it came with.  The sound some times is really low during a call.  But other then those so far it's a nice cell.  But I'm ready for a new one. Call customer service about it,  no comment on that.  Just have patience when you call them because they don't have none.  I called and email them.
Instruction book is terrible.  Having trouble with volume. May have to return.
My phone no longer works I can call but they can't hear me but I can hear them
This is a very good looking phone, especially for the price that it is on the market for. Good fast working phone, I got this phone becuase I am a college student on a budget so this was a great deal. I have it with T-Moblie service and can't complain at all, everything runs smooth and fast. It also has an amazing 8mp camera for taking very nice photos, another pro is that it gives you the phablet expericne with its 6" HD display. All of my friends ask me where I got the phone and they say its a huge good looking phone, so overall I'm happy with my purschase.
Love my new phone had over two months now only problem it seems to want to drop wfi so I would recommend getting plan with lots of data other than no issues I love the size and easy to use I have had so any compliments on it and tell them where to get it and how cheap it was I'm very happy with my new blu phone and will buy another when this one is no good I would recommend this to anyone on a budget who doesn't want to spend 800$ for a Galaxy or $1000/for an I phone or just anyone getting use to smart phones its simple not a lot of hard stuff an awesome phone
I wasn't getting my hopes up after reading some of the reviews but I am really happy with this device.  I needed something new when my Nexus 7 (2012) was afflicted with Android 5.0 and this phone is way better.<br/><br/>It performs very smoothly and the screen is really nice.  It is a little heavier than my larger Nexus 7, though.  The hardware buttons are weird and take getting used to.<br/><br/>Overall, I would easily recommend this phone.  I hope I don't eventually run into all these issues people have with it, but unless I do I'm super happy with it!
I ordered this phone after reading many reviews in amazon, but personally I did not like this phone and below are the few drawbacks I noticed after using for 3 days:<br/><br/>1) Touch screen is not working properly. I need to tap multiple times to select<br/>2) Microphone is too bad and I need to talk louder than usual so that the people at the other end will hear my voice<br/>3) Speaker is also bad that I could not hear properly the voice of people over the phone. It is very low<br/>4) Phone is bit lengthy<br/>5) Google maps hangs intermittently
This is the second BLU cell phone I had to return! For some unknown reason, this phone would reset itself randomly. For about 3 days, this phone would shut down, then restart all by itself. Never had a cell phone do that before!  I double check to make sure it wasn't an app issue..... and it wasn't.<br/><br/>The second issue was the volume and sound quality of the phone. For me, I had to strain to hear the other person during a conversation. With the volume at max, I still couldn't understand parts or the conversation due to the volume being so low.
works outstanding on t-mobile.  just wish I could find a strong case for it
got this phone to replace my blu life view tht burned out:( thisss came in 2 days ,,, hudge phone and the display beautiful >  I love it <3 updated it too kitkat thts cool to , the back camera is awesome (better thann the life views ) and the front camera nt tht bad either (not as good as the life views tho not at all) call quality is okk ,phone space is great and it takes sd cards so yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss ,, I loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee my new phone
Worked ok for about a month. First I noticed a lot of missed calls, the Blu never rang. I always had 4 bars 4G service here constantly. Now I have 0-3 bars edge speed and no signal. BLU phone is pure junk. The thing is I have rarely even used the phone, go to use it and it doesn't work! Guess I'll have to switch back to my old iphone. Blu Studio 6.0 HD was a waste of money. Oh, and no LED notifications either, now it doesn't work at all - it says emergency calls only one minute, 3 bars edge (slow) speed the next, go to use it and has zero signal.
Love it . would definitely buy it again . one con is screen breaks easily
Good phone.... So far, volume is low hope there is a fix for that soon ;)
I love this phone! It's big but its very lightweight. I was shopping for a phone because my Galaxy S2 kept dropping calls & acting erratic. I originally wanted a Galaxy Note 2 or 3 but didn't want to pay $250-350 to get one. I'm so glad I saw this phone & took a chance & bought it. Not only did I save $100-$200, I also got a one of the best most affordable phones out there. So I'm a happy camper, to say the least. Thanks to BLU and fast shipping from the seller. I also love the extras that were included for free! Can't beat this deal!
Love this phone! Today, it is totally unnecessary to spend big bucks for a great phone. With this unlocked phone you can move from different plans and services anytime you wish, and it also has two sim card slots. This means you can actually have two different phone numbers in one phone, and from different service providers. The quality is great and it looks great..<br/>You must be patient when you first turn on the phone.. Mine booted up in Chinese but eventually connected with my ATT sim card and everything was perfect. Super buy!
i have had this phone for around four months now and i am already shopping for another phone. reason being my mic just stopped working. one day. It didn't fall or anything crazy it just stopped working. my phone doesn't ring cant play music without headphones and when i talk people cant hear me from the other end.Now i have to use my headphones for everything. Also the phone overheats for no reason. maybe i got the one bad phone from thousands of great phones but i checked online and many people have issues with their mics. if you want a phone to last you a long period let say more than a year this is not the phone for you. i recommended this phone to my friend when i first got it but she is having issues with it too. i wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.
I love this phone...its been two days and I cannot put it down. LOVE IT
Just love it. The screen is bigger and the price is definitely RIGHT:)
Having problems connecting beats wireless headphones. Any suggestions?
Update :<br/>1. After about 2 months it stopped reading any SD cards<br/>2. After a software update to KitKat 4.4.2 it got slow, sometimes wouldn't boot<br/>3. Died suddenly/unexpectedly 2 days ago<br/><br/>Original post<br/>I'm extremely pleased with my purchase..Very responsive. 64Gb SD Card installed OK. This is my 2nd BLU phone. No problems. With heavy use - WiFi, Bluetooth to transfer files to / from notebook + using the Led as a flashlight occasionally through the day to look in dark corners, battery has only depleted to 60%. Only feature missed is a notification LED!! Only gripe - can't locate a Hybrid Tank Stand Holster for it. Using my previous holster (ebay item #371079435521) for my Blu Studio 5.5 (tight fit but it works)!!!
This is a pretty good phone.  It is WAY WAY better than the studio 7" - the studio 7 is garbage with a dual core processor.  The 6HD is quad core, 4g which makes it much better.  It still suffers compared to Samsung phones clocked at the same speed.  Also the resolution is so poor on this screen it looks like a computer in "safe mode" all of the icons are large like they are made for toddlers.  It is a good phone and it just isnt VERY good.  The Studio 5.5 HD was VERY good - better than this one.
I really like this phone. Purchased in May so still learning the ins and outs of it. Great vibrant colors and I'm very excited that I can see my screen even on very sunny days standing in direct sunlight. Speed is great with the amount of storage the phone itself which is a great plus. Was able to download all my docs and can edit my work through a great little app called Office Suite. So far I have no complaints, but I will continue this review after a few months of usage. For now it's definitely a 4 Star!
I would give this product no stars but then i couldn't put a review. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. It's a nice looking phone but the screen NEVER WANTED TO WORK. Sometimes it would sometimes no. Wouldn't let me answer calls, froze up all the time.. Only had it for a week until I got so frustrated with it not working, I threw it across the room and broke it to pieces. DON'T waste your TIME or MONEY on this PRODUCT!!
Amazing phone for the price - if not perfect. The capabilities are astounding for the price!  Dual-SIM slots mean travel with it is a matter of picking up a SIM at your destination...<br/><br/>The camera is very good,  the phone never seems to be lagging on apps, the display is excellent, battery life good - 4G network access is lightning fast.<br/><br/>However, since updating to Android 5.0.2, I find I need to re-boot the phone at least once a day - or my cell phone coverage goes away... Not so good.
Several issues including graphics failure on industry standard games such as Boom Beach. Any media players that you are using, whether they are local, FM, or streaming music, it will cut out on you every 15 minutes and completely close the application. The GPS, as with my other BLU phone (Life One), absolutely sucks. You have to reboot your phone for it to find you. This will be my last BLU product unless they release updates addressing these issues quickly. At some point a bargain is no longer a bargain.
Couldn't hear calls at all. Good LOOKING phone..but that's about it.
I like this phone but the problem I had was when the battery would run low and if you let it shut off it was hard to get it turned back on with a charge, you would get a screen with all this Chinese writing and I would have to literally keep pushing buttons for atleast 10-15 minutes, then it would automatically start taking pictures, it was a hassle, so I  would never let the battery run all the way low, and you cant take the battery out because it's built in, other than that I did like the phone.
Sometimes have to reset phone just to use data and have to use WiFi
Love my phone. I wanted a tablet with phone capable but was running from something that was too big. I was delighted when I came across this one. The price point is great for what you're getting. The screen is nice and big for a phone and very workable as a tablet, exactly what I was looking for. As to specifications, I'm no techie but it has the ability to hold a 64g card loads of space for my tonnes of pictures and videos. I love it and would recommend it especially if your on a budget...
Screen does not look HD. Starts to lag after a few apps are open.
I was very surprised it didn't get network connection on vacation
Purchased two different 6.0 Blu phones and both had defects. The speaker was bad on both phones and the touch screen doesn't work very good with a screen protector on it. I have two Blu 5.5s phones that are awesome. I put screen protectors on both and gave one to wife and we both enjoy the android phones. I did update the 6.0 and that didn't cure anything. I'll stick with the 5.5s phones till something better is offered by blu. I did prefer the 6.0 size but not the functionality.
Best purchase I've made all year, I've had it for a few weeks now and its really great! The only issue I see is the trippy battery. Sometimes It'll run down to 15percent battery, so I'd put it on the charger and it would jump to 80 or 90 withing a few seconds but then when I take it off the charger it runs down really fast so then I have to put it back on the charger and when I see that its charging slow then I know the charge will last. Other than that everything else is great.<br/><br/>[UPDATE]<br/>So about a week over a month of having the phone it dropped and there was a crack right across the soft keys. The actual "touch screen"  part of the phone was fine, but everytime I clicked on something I couldn't back out because the back button wouldn't work so I had to restart my phone everytime I wanted to leave an app. Unfortunately they have a 30 day rule and I just missed it. I tried selling the phone and the guy straight up told me that they don't buy BLU phones along with some other places I tried. I also tried to get it fixed, but they said to get it fixed would cost more than the actual phone. This phone is very crappy and I was upset that I couldn't get a refund! My advice would be to stick with your local carrier's phones because you can't do anything with a phone like this.
First phone came in damaged packaging, dust and grit in the box, scratched up screen, etc. Sent it back, got another. I really like it, it seems as solid as any LG or Samsung I've used and the screen  and camera are great. If you want something faster, get the Studio 6.0 LTE. If you don't need to have a blazing fast phone but still want the convenience of everyday usage, buy this. Granted, it's so large it's difficult to use one handed unless you've got mitts like a NBA player.
Amazing phone! I was scared to buy a phone from BLU because I usually stick with Samsung and didn't want to try a new brand but wow I made a good choice. The phone comes with a screen protector and silicone case. Only thing is you can't find a hardshell case or any other case online for maximum protection. I really hope they change that because I certainly do not want my phone to get scratched or anything. Good quality, good material, fast phone and beautiful screen. Thanx BLU!
I love it, but be VERY careful not to drop and crack the screen.
This phone is OK...but the front camera sucks....its a nice size
Before purchasing, I made cardboard templates for the 5", 5.5" and 6" for my sister to decide which she preferred. She chose the 6.0 and is very satisfied with it. She uses Bluetooth to pair with her home phone and automobile. I would recommend turning off the Wi-Fi when not in use as this tends to run the battery down quick. Using Bluetooth the battery last about 2 days, using Wi-Fi about 12 hours. A note of importance, battery is not replaceable.
Good phone gave it to my husband I got the blu touch book instead but the 6" blu studio was a good phone till my husband sat on it and broke the screen he sat on it on the curve part of the couch I don't think anything could hold up to that  it bent upward and cracks cracked but it is strong once I drop on the cement ground just a little ding on the edge but still worked perfectly
I love this phone it is reliable does everything that I want it to do it's fast the screen is big but not too big. Had it for about 2 months and it still runs fast still runs good really really good phone for the price that you pay. I definitely recommend this phone for anybody looking for a smart reliable phone but the only downfall to it is the sound on the speaker and on the headphones are just little bit low for my liking but it's okay it's still doable!
First, When I recieved my phone, i was like ...WOW! Its a big phone. After setting it up and adding my sim card,it worked in seconds!<br/>I have T-moble, no issues at all.... there isnt a 3 or 4G in the corner of phone,  just a H+ or 4G.... I have found a new company..BLU!  I have had the other BIG named flagship phones, why pay 500.00+ plus for them.... BTW, they are not cheap phones that are made in China!!! Give it a try........ you won't regret it!!
Its OK just can't do things I use to do on my Samsung Galaxy
works well but is a some what with the bluetooth capability.
I have had my phone for a few months.This is a good phone for the price,the only problem I have with the phone is when playing music the speaker isn't that loud,And it will work on cricket/ATT,but u will have to change ur APN setting to ATT after that ur phone will work with no problem.If u want a big phone to watch videos and not hurt ur pockets this phone is for u.This phone is just as good as the Zte grand max if not better cuz of the price.
So far had this phone for a week and I must say I am happy with the purchase.<br/><br/>The screen is huge, bright, and I can play my emulations without hassle. I love the KitKat OS on here. Speakerphone sucks but kinda knew that going into this endeavor.<br/><br/>I'd say my biggest problem is the battery....it dies somewhat quicker than I'd like. My 5.5 lasts longer than this phone.<br/><br/>Overall, minor issues but still a good phone.<br/><br/>UPDATE*<br/><br/>System updated to lollipop 5.0 OS. Definite improvement of the system, and things load a lot faster. Volume has increased, but not by a significant amount. And the system has gone up on battery usage after optimizing the apps (used to only last a day, now it lasts about 34 hours)
I cannot know when I get a message. The lights not working.
Phone screen cracked in a weeks time. and it was not droped
Didn't like the phone, it kept erasing my picture and music
The phone is everything that I expected.  It is fast and large.  It is easy to use, but the battery does seem to drain quickly,  Also there have been issues with loading a few apps that I had on the phone I replaced.  Also the settings aren't as flexible as those on the replaced phone.  I haven't used it overseas yet either, which is why I purchased it in the first place.  I expect that it will work exactly as well as it works stateside.
Super fast delivery, very impressed. Okay I've had this phone for a couple of days now. I love everything except that the speaker is soooo low and when you want to listen to music it is sooooo low. That is the only reason I gave it 4 stars, other than that it is an excellent phone for the money hands down. The clarity is beautiful and I like the big screen, I had the mega galaxy before this phone. The camera on this phone is way better.
I bought this for use as a car computer.  The screen is nice and big, and definitely bright enough.  The problem I have is the polarization.  In landscape mode, my sunglasses block the view of the screen.<br/><br/>Another issue I had was finding a micro-usb cable that would stay connected.  I suspect the port on this phone is deeper than other phones.<br/><br/>Other than that it's great, but definitely too large to use as a phone.<br/><br/>Edit:  One thing I forgot.  The micro-usb port is on the top, and it's backwards.  What is generally considered the front of the USB port faces the back of the phone.  For my use in landscape mode, being on the top is not a problem.  But I could see how someone not paying attention could try forcing the USB plug in the wrong way and damage the port.
One of the worst phones on the earth.... no joke I know I was going the affordable way but I was not expecting trash. The volume on this phone is really really low, and the picture is worst then that. I could only use this phone for one hour because that all I could take. Do not buy this phone if you are into great quality but it is as big as it say... but I really don't like a big pile of trash. So I RETURNED as fast as it came
Great phone just as other positive comments stated: fast response, easily connect to WiFi, fast data on at&t; network, high resolution screen. Only minor issue is the auto brightness that seems to act too frequently so the screen brightness keeps changing slightly but visibly. Other issue is keys become less responsive on certain web sites (?). Just had to wait a little. Also like the ability to store new apps on extra SD card.
SAME DAY DELIVERY, LIKE PROMISED.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVING IT.
Im in love with my blu!!! it is a great phone for a great price, I lost my samaung s3 anda now I don't miss it at all!!! this is so much better than samsung s3 in my opinion! I recomeded it! even the camera (that was the best of s3) it's great! so if your looking for a great for and don't want to pay a lot of money this is the best option!!<br/><br/>pd: it is very big, so if u don't like that, try another blu maybe 5.5 :)
Good phone , gpod price, bad company updates. Got off the phone with tech support all they gave me was cheap excuse re- setting the phone to factory setting did not help cause it did not re set to it. New software update  from BLU made it worse apps, despaired memory of card un  able to be recognized, photo button not working.  All was good until the software update don't bother calling BLU help desk there no help at all
Its a decent phone especially for the price. Get a new home launcher for it and its 10 times better. The size is a blessing and a curse. For kindle and movies its great but, just physically handling it is awkward which means you will drop it at some point and when you do the cheap thin screen will shatter like an old plate glass window.<br/><br/>Mines dead now but i would buy again if there were more options for cases.
I'm really enjoying this phone. Plus it have more space.
its a great phone I'm really enjoying the time I have learned about the phone I would recommend the phone just about anyone but I have one problem its hard trying to find a secure case for the phone that fits all out there is a thin case that don't protect the phone the blue 5.5 has protective case I have the 6.0 there is no protective case no Otter boxcan someone please help me find a protective case or know of any.
Let me start by saying this phone is absolutely amazing and competes head-to-head with the name-brands like Apple and Samsung and wins in several areas -- particularly cost and screen size.  The screen on my iPhone 6 looks puny compared to the BLU Studio 6.0 HD but I have to use it for work.  The screen looks as good or better than any screen I've had on my Samsung Galaxy phones too.<br/><br/>Since I already have an iPhone with an expensive data plan, I wanted to keep this phone inexpensive but usable.  In other words, I wanted it to be a phone and not a mini-tablet but I didn't want a monthly service contract so pay-as-you-go was the choice for me.  Here's a list of the add on's I got for this phone:<br/>1) PTEL SIM CARD (not a nano) with a $100 balance.  You want to put $100 on it because smaller balances expire too quickly but $100 lasts a year.<br/>2) 64GB SDXC SANDISK Memory.  When it comes to SD memory. I stick with Sandisk who invented SD memory for a couple of dollars more.<br/>3) BLU ArmorFlex PC+silicon case for Studio 6.0 HD - Carrying Case - Retail Packaging - Neon Orange+Black.  It comes with a case but I like this one better and it makes the phone easy to find being bright orange.<br/>4) XShields (4-Pack) Ultra Clear HD Screen Protector Cover Guard For BLU Studio 6.0.  There is a single screen protector included but it isn't the best quality.  I put it on the phone but I didn't like the feel so I switched to the XShields.<br/><br/>Now, for a fraction of the cost of an iPhone 6s with an expensive service plan, I have a fully-operation smartphone with virtually the same capabilities.<br/><br/>Setup was a breeze.  The first thing I did was to remove the back cover by carefully prying it open from the lower-corner and inserted the SIM card and SDXC memory.  I activated my SIM card previously.  After turning on the phone and selecting a language, I connected it to my WiFi and immediately updated to OS to Android 4.4.2 (the screen is in Japanese but it works).  BTW: My phone has 6GB of RAM not 1GB like the description says.<br/><br/>After that, it was the usual setup for an Android phone.  I installed my regular apps, setup email and disabled the SIM card so there were no surprises when I was in range of WiFi.<br/><br/>The battery is not replaceable and that does not concern me at all.  I'm sure that the battery will last two years at which point, I'll probably be ready for a new phone anyway.<br/><br/>On a side note, this phone's 6" display is big enough to be used like a small tablet and with 6GB of RAM you could use it out-of-the-box on a WiFi network as one.  It's not a toy but it's a lot better than the small tablets sold for children albeit not as rugged.<br/><br/>The fact that this phone isn't made by some giant company doesn't bother me one bit.  I wouldn't be surprised if it used the same parts or was made in the same factories that they use.
Does not work, volume unstable and can not be adjusted.
I have it for two month, so far very good. No problems.
The phone itself and specs are awesome. The charging hole at the top won't hold the micro USB in, so the slightest touch pulls it out and stops charging. Came out of the box like this, gonna try getting a refund and ordering another to see if its just the one I bought. Other than that its a phenomenal phone for 150ish and works with 4g speeds on straight talk for 45/mo. None of that high priced contract stuff.<br/><br/>UPDATE: it was just that phone. Returned and got a different one and it holds a charger better.
The sound is not a good as the previous version of this phone. The battery life could also use some improvement. The accompanying headphones are bad and the plastic case that come with the phone should have the button holes cut out. However overall the phone is a good phone for the price. I recommend this phone for the individual who wants a big screen and is not overly caught up by brand name competitors.
This phone is really awesome. I really recommended it.
So far so good awesome phone great price can't beat it
I had this phone for a couple months now and at first it was great! Now it turned off and won't turn back on. And to top it all of. BLU Nor Amazon will do anything about it!! So you are just wasting your money. My boyfriend has a BLU phone 5c and it did the same exact thing! I know that I will never buy another BLU product!
The Phone is not yet tested overseas. when that is accomplished, a follow-up review will be submitted. But I read great things about the "BLU", It sells in the Caribbean, my wife, I bought the Studio X for her, she loves it and has begun to use it here in USA. She has no complaints. Truth told on this phone thing-She has a Samsung III S-but wished she knew how to be contract free years ago.
So much better platform than my Amazon Fire phone. I'll keep my Fire phone for taking professional quality photos. The Blu phone is spectacular! I'm not a gamer, I'm a seller. A huge part of my online business success depends on promoting through social medias. This allows me to get notifications from all social media, as well as my Etsy store. This phone doesn't seem to be lacking in any thing.
Love the size but has some drawbacks which I knew going into the purchase. Sound is very soft when on a call so I use the speaker option when on a call. Messages dont go through most of the time when I am in my house because of network I guess and its frustrating but away from the house, the messages go through better. The network says 4g but I suspect it lower maybe hence not working indoors.
This phone works as well as some of the more populàr
I purchased this phone the end of May 2015. The phone got extremely hot to the touch today and the screen went black. My phone is completely useless. As a single parent of a special needs child this is my only source of communication. I can't afford to purchased another phone at this time. When I contacted Amazon all I got was the run around. This will be my last purchase on this site!
I've had the phone for 2 months now and overall I wouldn't recommend the phone to anybody. I'm not able to send or receive pictures. My phone plan is with Family Mobile and with this phone it's the worse. I'm going back to Samsung or LG phones.  This phone sucks!!! the volume is very low, the picture quality is horrible. I like the size of the phone but besides that it's horrible.
No one hears me when it is on speaker phone. It downloads pictures fro the net by itself. The time fluctuates between Mountain, Central, and Eastern time throughout the day. It is difficult to operate it with one hand because of its enormous size. It goes off by itself. I could have kept it if the date was correct and the speaker phone  work well because the price is good. Sorry
This phone BLU 6.0 replaced my EVO 4 LTE. Battery life is very good, about a day and a half before recharge is needed. My EVO would get me through 3/4 of my day before a charge. The phone is large but I like it big. I use a headset anyway but some people might be happier with the 5.0. Plenty of features and no hiccups make this the best phone for me and you can't beat the price.
I have had this phone for 3 months. When I make calls the person on the other end can no longer hear me. I can hear them fine. I have determined that the microphone is defective. Since it is past the 30 day return period on Amazon, I have contacted the manufacturer. Waiting to see what their response is
There was this one problem I have with the Blu studio 6.0 hd D650a is that "It's Simply Amazing"👏👏 I really couldn't have asked for anything better. Although the phone was used it had no abrasions it absolutely seemed to be new, also well packaged including a screen protector matching charger and headphones with a mic!!!! On a scale of 1-10 I'm going to say 10+👌
Dead on arrival im soop pissed right now
i like the phone except the volume its really low
Never buy this model. I just bought it 3 months ago. because of over heating i just moved the phone away and it got the scratch accidentally. Now BLU asks me to trade the phone because they stopped supporting this model.So, please don't buy this model. It heats up very quick within less duration.
I bought this yesterday as just as a temporary phone because I dropped and broke my expensive one. And this phone has exceeded my expectations. I had a Samsung, Sony, LG and Apple in the past but this phone performs as good as those models. I'm started to think that I might have been buying overpriced phone in the past that perform the same as this inexpensive one.
This phone is amazing!!! You can screen shot by pressing the volume down button and power button at the same time. It has many features like a IPhone and Samsung phone would have. If it freezes, all you have to do is open it and remove the SD card. Once you replace it, the phone will start up again. I am very happy with this phone. It's fantastic for what it cost!
Have only had it for 4 days, but as of yet I have not experienced any software issues, etc.<br/>The phone is big! Picture quality is spot on. OS is fast, no waiting on apps to load. Updated itself straight out of the box. Inserted my sim card and I was up and running, no issues.<br/>Love this phone. I will definitely be purchasing more BLU phones in the future!<br/><br/>****Update*****<br/>I have now had this phone 5 mo's. I still love the idea of this phone but.......I have had battery issues 3 times now. Each time I have submitted a support request on Blu's site, and the first 2 times the answer I received was to do a "Hard Reset" on the phone. This worked the first time, but the 2nd time - not so sure, but I dealt with it. This 3rd request I submitted, I made it very clear that I either want a replacement phone or a refund. No more Hard Resets! After 2 days of no response, I called them. The customer service rep I spoke with asked a few questions concerning my phone battery and charger. After speaking with him, he agreed that a replacement phone needed to be shipped out, as I had been without a phone now for 3 days! My last battery problem consisted of no charge to the phone and every time I plugged the charger in I would receive an error message " Battery to cool to charge" or "Error! Please Plug Out Charger"  what does this mean ? Unplug my charger??? Anyway, so the customer service guy tells me he is going to send out a replacement phone since the phone has a year warranty on it but we have to speak with his manager to get it processed. So I speak to his manager. His manager decides I don't need a new phone - they will just send me a new charger, as they have been having problems with this particular models chargers. So here I sit 2 weeks later with no phone, no charger, and still paying the bill. So I send them a very professional, but firm email yesterday stating my unhappy feelings about this whole situation. This morning I check my email and no response. So, I call them again. Now they tell me they can't give me any information concerning my requests, just that they will be sending me an email within 24 hrs. and that I need to wait for that. So, at this point, I am really unhappy with this company and not sure that I will ever buy another one of their products if this is how they treat the customer.<br/>Will update if I hear anything....<br/>****Update****<br/>I received the new charger last week and as expected, the new charger did not help my problem. Phone still will not take charge. I call them again. Now I am on my 5 customer service rep, keep in mind every time I call I have to explain my story all over again because they have no clue what's going on. So after I explain, this rep begins to ask me the same questions I've been asked the other times I've called. She proceeds to try and send me another charger. I tell her this is unacceptable that I would like to speak to a manager, that I would like a refund, as my phone is still under warranty. She tells me that they don't do refunds, that it's the seller's responsibility. I am blown away at this point -- can't even think straight I'm so mad. So I hang up, contact Amazon and explain my situation and Amazon steps up to the plate and honors the product with a full refund- no haggling, no 50 questions, just straight up great customer service on Amazon's part. Thanks Amazon for being the reputable company you portray yourself to be! Another happy customer here! However, I will never, ever buy another BLU Product, nor will I recommend them to anyone just for the simple fact they would not take responsibility for their product.
I like it. It has a sucky camera but overall the screen is wonderful. It is a big phone which I was surprised by because I didn't read the spevs and though it would only be a bit bigger then my old studio 5.5 or the same size. It did turn out to be a bit bigger but screenshots are harder to take on this phone. But other then that its really great and I like it.
All I can say is ..IM IN LOVE WITH THIS PHONE..I ordered the case too..and I'm so glad that I did..it fits perfectly..and I've managed to drop it and the case really works..I have Cricket/Att service and all I did was order the nano sim card..put it in and it downloaded everything.. Not one problem.. As much as I love Samsung phones.. This phone is #1 with me.
Great phone now I can tether my data with out getting an upsell (T-Mobile) page popping up. Excellent build quality and great screen size make this phone a must I couldn't ask for anything more for the price and as I stated before you are able to tether your data connection for free anyone with T-Mobile knows what I mean that alone is worth its weight in gold.
Makes for a nice mini-tablet but not much else. It may the carrier that is the problem, I don't know, but call quality is not that great and calls are subject to dropping. Add that to the fact that this phone is like holding an iPad to your face results in this phone leaving a lot to be desired. If it wasn't free to me as a reviewer, I would not own it.
I have had my phone for awhile now and I love it.... I have OT though straight talk I was easy to hook up though them....
These are a good deal for the money.  They are not the quality of a Samsung phone, but for the price they are pretty amazing.  If you are looking for a big phone at a bargain price, and are not expect the same quality as a phone that costs three times more, this is a good option.  The dual SIM slot is a nice addition for international travelers.
I really like my 6.0. Its very helpful to me, working from home and being a mom on the go. No real problems yet. Except when I 1st turned it on it shout down and I couldnt take the battery out. It did that a couple of times at 1st, now its cool. I like the system updates I receive so I'm never slow and im up to date. Cool light phone. Love it!
After having my phone for about a week it no longer comes on. I mind you the phone has never been dropped. The battery was low and eventually the phone died after placing it on the charger for about 3-4 it wouldn't power on. I left it on charger for 24 hrs and it has yet to power on. I feel it was a waste of money!!!! I'm so disappointed!!!!
My favorite phone so far. Only complaint is the chargers cord is an odd size I broke one I think my roomba ate it the mini USB plug on the phone side bent its longer than a regular mini usb. Luckily when my wife saw my new big phone she wanted one so we had a spare cord. The price was great and with my Walmart plan its very affordable.
Very nice phone and everything works. There were 3 updates since i got the phone so it is nice to know Blue is uapating the software. The only problem I have is the touch screen is not that sensitive and on occasions I have to press the keys twice for it to register.
Great phone for most users. If you are looking for I phone quality pics, this might not be the phone for you. I also notice the audio (both call volume & listening to music) is not as great as other phones . Call volume is still OK though. Overall, I am satisfied with this phone. It fits all of my needs and still looks very stylish.
Until now I have a great experience with my phone. Big screen. Fast browsing, checking Facebook, emails. Watch movies, videos (youtube, netflix). Nice sound. Camara is enough for my necessities. Easy to install the SIM card (use standard no micro SIM). Excellent connection with TMobile. Love my cellphone.!!!!! Thanks Blue Products.
Horrible reception and phone quit working 6 months later.  The callers could not hear me but i could hear them.  As far as the screen size it was awesome.  The great thing about it was that Amazon stood behind a product that failed after 30 days.  I am writing this because I love Amazon.  I wish I could give this company 5 stars!
When it comes to smartphones, im staying with BLU. These phones are amazing and even better is the price. These are what you call the working mans phone. Yup I got bills to pay and mommy and daddy don't pay for your stuff than this is the phone for you. The only con I found is finding a drop proof case like otter box or the such.
It works as well as all of the rave said it would, the only problem I have is I can't find a hard protective case for it...If anyone has any idea where I can find one for the Blu Studio 6.0 HD please let me know, other than that I'm pleased with my purchase!!!
This phone is a good phone but there are line's in the screen,  I could only put it to my right ear to hear any one talking also the speaker is not loud so I miss alot of phone call's.  I have to be next to my phone at all time's in order not to miss a phone call. There are not much phone cases for this phone to protect it.
I like it, it was really big phone, so I had a bit of trouble holding it in one hand but I kinda wanted something with a big screen so it worked fine, was pretty fast and battery life was okay. Picture quality was alight as well. I like the fact that it comes with a silicon case and a screen protector with headphones also.
It has performed better than expected.  I was wanting a large phone without pay the price for a Note.  In the couple of months I've had it, it has locked a couple of times but I think that was more the software (app) than the phone.  The only downside I have encountered is there are not many choices when it comes to cases.
SEE UPDATE (Second Paragraph):<br/>The phone looks good and works pretty well. But, sometimes its too slow while on high speed internet. I can live with that. But, what I do not like is that the screen goes black and the phone becomes unresponsive when I open applications. This problem occurs at least 3 times a day and I have to restart my phone every time.<br/><br/>I received a new phone from amazon immediately after notifying them that the screen would go black. The black unresponsive screen was not a common occurrence on the new phone, It only happened about 4 times in three and 1/2 months. However, just yesterday, it decided to stop turning on. It was working perfectly fine up until 4:30pm yesterday, then it died at 40% battery charge and would not turn back on. The phone was never dropped, no cracks,no  dings or water damage. It looks brand new.<br/> Now i am over the 30 day return policy, but i will contact Amazon. I will update this review with their solution.
Everything was going well with my phone until I performed the update. I've had numerous problems with it since then. I have contacted my carrier as well as blu studio SEVERAL TIMES and the problem has not been resolved.
Bought two of these and my wife is thrilled and I could not be happier. KitKat upgraded fast,screen is razor sharp,and my galaxy tab 2 7.0 is now in a drawer somewhere.Coworkers were impressed,and even with playing all day on phone ,still had 70% battery after a 9 hour workday. I would definately buy this phone again.
Phones great and huge, very happy with it....camera not like omg good but good, works with T-Mobile but keep in mind it takes the big Sim card! Other than that I can't complain on this phone!! Cheap but still better than buying some high dollar phone that does the same thing. Get it I would buy it again if I had too.
After dropping and cracking my first BLU Studio 6.0 HD Phablet I ordered a replacement which cost considerably less that the first.  Very pleased with this phone.  I would highly suggest looking into this company if anyone is considering purchasing a phone that is less expensive as the Samsung, LG or any other brand.
Phone constantly got hot. Battery drained quick. Waste of money cuz battery is attached and no one repairs cracked screens in BLU phones. Not this one but my previous one cracked. They said cheaper to buy a new one. Battery issue they said send it back but it was past amamzons date and I haven't had phone 6 months.
the man at the front was right if you do everything to it its a very good phone for now i have had my phone two days now and i love it i just turned the phone on and put my sim card in and it was ready to got i had a note 3 had it 3 months and the speaker wait out hope i dont have problem with this one
This is the best $168 I ever spent.  Very capable device that is a quad core.  Whopping six inch phablet.  I don't miss not having a Samsung Note 4.  I purchase for use in the Philippines and so far it is absolutely a great device.  I am using the dual SIM function and it is great.  Works like a charm.
The funny story about this phone. I did my homework and ordered it, someone stole it I received a roll of tape instead!!! Finally got the phone and I love it screen is huge.  It connected to the car with Bluetooth and it works with cricket wireless!<br/>It was worth all the hang ups.<br/>  Ma'shall
Phone started messing up within one day
Good but the speaker is not good enough
This is a nice for the price. If you bought an iPhone; Galaxy 1, 2, or 3 you can get tons of Aps.<br/>It also has Dual SIMs, like having multiple phones in 1. My problem was my battery and the On/Off button.<br/>Still waiting for them to send me one back. Gotta check my account..........later!
Fast and powerful, plenty of storage, great signal and call quality, giant screen is crisp and responsive<br/><br/>Only negatives is that the built in speaker quality isn't that great, and the top charging port is backwards and a little too deep into the phone, some standard chargers won't fit
Mom (76 years old) needed a bigger screen for checkbook, calendar, and etc. She had a 3.5" screen smartphone and it wasn't working very well for her. The display, speed and camera are all very good. Almost kept ourselves. She has had it a month now and has really made a difference for her.
I normally upgrade my smart phone every two years and pay $100 - $200 for whatever Android model is new and stylish at the moment of upgrade. Of course, I only get that price because I am also signing a 2 year contract at the same time. Even with those terms, the carriers are unhappy with the "break" they are giving you, and so my carrier (AT&T;) is now trying to get everyone to pay full price on new phones by allowing quicker upgrades but also breaking up the full purchase price into several years worth of payments, as if you were buying a car. I don't like paying $600 for a phone (even with installments), and that's where phones like the BLU Studio 6.0 (hereafter BLS6) come in. What would you get if you only wanted to pay $150 with no contract and no commitment to a carrier?<br/><br/>PROS: The screen and camera were the high points here. Beautiful HD screen, and a camera interface that was both simple to use and productive of good pictures. The accessories provided were also extensive and pretty high quality: case, screen protector, earbuds. The internet browser was well done and robust, and streaming video content looked nice when you had a good WF / HDSPA speed. (More below.)<br/><br/>CONS: Gaming was hit and miss, with some areas of the screen not functioning when tapped on some games. (The screen worked fine in other apps, so I am thinking it was some odd quirk between this hardware and the games I was playing.) File handling was hit and miss, with some file types like PDF and XLS not being supported at all. After years of owning Apple and Samsung  devices, I have gotten kind of spoiled and expect to see _something_ happen when I download an attachment! The speed on my home WF network seemed below average, and I could not get much above 3G speeds when using ATT's network when mobile. After being accustomed to 4G LTE, this phone felt sluggish for many purposes, especially large downloads and streaming. Finally, the onboard memory is parsimonious (8GB is pitiful in this day and age) but you can at least add a simcard. There were also far fewer preloaded apps on this compared to Samsung, but in truth I did not miss many of the missing Samsung apps, many of which are not exactly essential. Music player also lacked volume, though the codec was OK. Did not drive full size headphones well, basically needs IEMs to get decent volume level.<br/><br/>Neutral: Battery life was adequate, not stunning, about as much as Note 3. The new opp system download within a few hours of activation was nice, but did not seem to change much. (Maybe behind the scene bug fixes?) Call quality was pretty good, not quite at Apple levels, but the speaker feature sounded tinny. Signal strength finding was about average, better than HTC, not quite as good as the newer Samsungs or Apple.<br/><br/>Upshot: You will not feel like you have an Iphone 6 or a Galaxy S5. You will feel several hundred dollars richer, as long as you are buying off contract, and you will have a nice camera and a reasonably capable net browser. You will also have a functional cell phone, and a nice screen to watch videos on, as long as you are not relying on streaming content. All in all, I felt the price point justified the quality well enough. I personally would probably pay a bit more for a true LTE compatible phone and would probably want at least 16GB of onboard memory, but for $150, this is a pretty good deal.
"One Big Glitch....No App will Fix this Internal Hardware Manufacturer Issue"....Audio!!!....Poor Speaker!!! ...Terrible Microphone!!! ...A Basic Essential A Smart Phone should Not have Issues With!!!...A Rooting would Help... Since this Model is Relatively New... You Would have More Risks Bricking the Device....I would leave that to the Real Geek Wizards out there who have the Experience!!!..There is a Reason the Device came with Headset ...So you can hear the Caller and They can hear you Back!!!....Blu's Quick Fix I think.....<br/>And Here is Why I gave this a 3 Star is the Rest of the Phone has Some Great Features:...Great Screen Size NO Need for Cheaters and there is a Font Setting of X large to boot...Great Screen Pixels and Such Great Sharp Quality Would Be Great for Gaming....Android with All the Extra Features and Loads of Apps!!!...Allows you to Install an Upgrade to Kitkat and 4 G!!!...Smooth Quick Browser and Not too many Hip Ups...Comparable to Most Smart Phones...Great Camera 8MP Photos look Great ...I decided not to Send Back think I can Work with the The main defective Issue By Purchasing An External Mini Microphone and Blue Tooth Ear Plug....I purchased 2 of these Blu's one of each color at Different times...I will Review on the Other Phone and Give an Update how the Mini Mic Worked and Over all Experience.<br/><br/>UPDATE: After having this phone for Little over a week... It has started running into freezing and Having to Reboot to Restart and the Second One that has the same issues with Audio... Poor Mic and Speaker... Totally froze and Locked up!!!!... No way of Rebooting or Shut down...Can not Even Remove Battery.....I am in the Process of Returning these Devices!!!...Disappointed that Internal Quality was Not as Appealing as the External!!!!..One Big Mess from the Start... Whats a Phone if You can not Hear your Caller and Visa Versa!!! And for a Big Screen ...A Tablets Cost would be considerable Less!!!...
It's a nice size phone the picture quality is excellent. The volume for the incoming calls could be better but with the headset its awesome. As far as the Internet service it depends on your provider I have metropcs and I keep losing signal on the phone and it has a quite of a long wait time.
After a month or two it's working fine
Great phone I love it, the only problem I'm having is a bought the phone in may and it hasn't even  been a year yet and it doesn't want to charge anymore. Trying to fix the problem but looks like I'll have to buy a new one, not a problem since I like the phone just wish it would last longer.<br/><br/>Update: phone doesn't want to charge anymore, i also don't want to go through the hassle of warranty claim and not having a phone for days or even weeks. I don't want to but i'm going to have to go back to an iphone. I'm sure i'll be back though once i get out of my contract.
Yesterday the sound stopped working.  After a hard reset the sound came back but not the Mic.  When i make calls, i can hear the other person but they can;t here me.  This issue came on suddenly.  Anyone have any idea's.  The phone was bought in April who is responsible for the warranty?
Phone is big and very nice but don't every let it fall it fell once and when a person calls me they can't hear me I have to use my headphones until I got it fix front camera good quality not all that but its OK back camera great 8.mega pixel not good when u zoom thou otherwise very nice
I'm satisfied with my blu 6.0 hd after 6 months of use it still holds up well! One draw back please don't update the phone it runs better with its original  OS, all in all best smart phone for the price and  surprisenly it holds it own very well besides the big names! Even out do some!
The phone goes into a Chinese mode at times. It just goes in a Chinese mode and do whatever it wants. I only have the phone a month now and it goes into its mood twice. Once I was travelling and needed to use the phone and could not. I speak English I don't know why it keeps doing thay
I have had my blu studio 6.0 hd for about 1 month now and when I first got the phone I love it but now my speakers isn't working when i receive calls I could hear the person but they can't hear me I put it in the shop today but still is a little disappointed.
I really wanted to keep this phablet!!! Everything was so good except for the call quality- deal breaker! The camera was nearly as good as my iPhone and in some cases better. Beautiful screen, speedy processing and solid feel. I'd almost buy this again just to use as a 6" tablet.
Put case and protective screen on barely dropped it it has a cracked on the phone now I can't dial use or answer and volume so low no one can ever hear me I'm disappointed and I would love a refund now I'm out of a phone
I'm so upset. I loved the phone but now my screen has black lines running through is when I want to watch videos the screen is completely gray. I never dropped it and I havent had it for two months yet.... Pretty pissed.
I've had this phone for about 2months and its now frozen and won't unfreeze, I've reset it...nothing. it's a neat phone when it's working. $200 dollars. I'm not a happy camper. This is my 2nd Blu phone, I upgraded to a bigger screen , but now I'm back to my smaller Blu phone. Sucks!
so far... awesome phone! all i had to do was put my sim in the slot and it worked immediately... my only suggestion would be that they work on the speaker. sometimes, even at full volume, its hard to hear the caller... still breaking it in... will update if any other problems arise.
looks fine but once you hold it, it feels a bit cheap. and the screen items position quite different than all other phones i use. should be a good phone. just feel its really cheap sw setup, also dont allow SD expansion for photo as well. get a large capacity if you want this brand.
It does everything I need with only one problem I've noticed. The touch screen near the bottom of the phone is a bit tempermental. It doesn't always read the first time which really sucks when playing games like subway surfer. Other wise its good, large screen, good battery, etc.
This item is great to look at... However, when I first turned it on, the phone was flickering big time. I did a factory reset.... even before installing or setting up my profile to see if that would fix it. It did... but I did noticed small flickerings/lines through out the screen. Also... the battery would not charge up. I plugged in both the supplied charger and my own charger I have another blu phone and it would not charge up. Two flaws in one... this phone is going back!<br/><br/>UPDATE: I went ahead and bought another one of these Blu 6.0 HD phones, from another seller. This phone came in brand new. As soon as I turned it on, it updated to KitKat, which is a good thing. So far, everything looks good and is performing good... EXCEPT, the port on the phone where you plug in the charger does not seem to be a good fit. I have placed the original shipped cord in the port and it did not charge. Then, I tried another USB cord that I have and after plugging it in, it started charging. But, if you move the phone or cord, it becomes unplugged preventing it from not charging. There is a problem with the charging port... as I believe it is the manufacturing of the phone error. It charges, just the cord won't stay in snug, so you don't have to worry about it falling out.
great phone but a part of the touch screen is not working, did a hard reset, and well... i just got it so it was stupid of me to even try, so, great speed,  big screen, but, if there's a way to make all the touch screen work without sending it back, it would be much appreciated.
Sorry to report i have to return this phone..... Was great for two weeks until phone started restarting randomly on its own.... Screen is huge 😁 great for the price also scrolling on a web page seems a little delayed i am going to buy another hoping i got a defective phone.....
Packaging of phone and accessories provided awesome. Looks - may be second to none. Sound poor. Touch response poor, sometimes annoying...not sure whether it might be an isolated incident with my phone. Speed acceptable. A great phone though for the price. I would buy it again.
This phone is amazing.  It does everything I have thrown at it.  The display is the best display I have seen in a cell phone.  No matter what angle.  Also there is no lagging whatsoever.  Item shipped right on time.  I tracked it the whole way and she came next day as promised.
This phone was far better than I expected.  Looking at the specs, I figured it would be a little slow, but I was pleasantly surprised.  This feels like a very modern phone.  The screen is not always as reactive as I would like, but price to value, I can't imagine a better deal.
this phone last me 2 months!!!! it just stopped coming on  and the thing is i can'<br/>t seem to find any battery replacement online for it.... Sucks
I am super satisfied with this phone, it's not hard top use at all. You really have to play with it to see what you can do, because not everything is in the Manual. Takes some getting used to because it is really BIG!!! Other than that I really don't have any complaints.
This phone is pretty effing awesome. I expected a big phone but this thing is literally a step down from a tablet. Nice responsiveness, great picture quality, and it can handle a lot of task at once which i wasnt too sure about with only 1gb Ram. Great buy for the price.
This phone started having issues from as early as February.Its almost inoperable just now,frequent hangups,screen touch isssues,power button stop working,cant be bothered,wondering if its a refurbished unit.
When switched on for the first time everything just went about fine but on Switching next day Mobile didn't get started instead whole lot of boot commands in Chinese were displayed and mobile didn't started.
Beautiful crafted phone but sound performance is poor. Speakerphone and earpiece are not loud enough even on highest setting. Tried installing an app for that but did not help. I went back to my Blu Studio 5.0C HD, now that's an awesome phone. Hope this review helps.
Phone works fairly well but the "s" key does not work. Sometime when I press "s" it gives nothing and sometimes it gives another character. Its really annoying considering this is a brand new phone. Would like a solution fast or I will have to return.
Couldn't use as the basic bottom buttons don't work like a "normal" android phone.  My work email needs the menu button for settings.  This is missing from this phone and the buttons it does have are not programmable for different functions that I can tell.
I Have had my phone for about a week now.... i absolutely loved it. And still do. But all of a sudden, my vibrate and speaker for people to hear me from the recieving end stopped working. Not sure what thats about? Havent exposed it ti any water or anything. Hmmm.
I ordered this product in August 2015 and by October 2015 Just after the return date had expired the phone just started shutting down. If you plug in headphones the phone cut out . I would not recommend anybody buy from this seller as products are defective.
The keyboard sticks and gets really slow especially when I'm sending a long message.<br/>Twice it has frozen and there was nothing g I could have done but wait for 12 hours till it eventually came back to life. Other than that is good. Great battery life.
I can never get the wifi to work.
Received this phone today. I must say it do look nice BUT the volume sucks!!! I can barely hear my callers. If anybody knows how to fix this let me know cause so far I will give this phone a 2*
This phone is great  the screen is huge love that  bad side for me is need more light when trying to vid in a club. My wireless network is<br/>Cricket wireless. It's network tower is AT&T.; For basic its $40. With automatic payment its $35. A month.
the phone was fine until water got in my case and leaked into my phone it would be helpful if i could take the battery out but it'll void the warranty... But the phone was very wonderful when i had it. Just mad that their customer service is crap.
This phone is one of the best phone ever! Sincerely speaking, in the category of IPhone and Samsung galaxy phones is sharp, smooth and easily contactable with my network subscriber FAMILY MOBILE WALMART. I love this phone<br/>Thank you AMAZON!!
I loved this phone at first. But honestly, it is too big.  I am currently on my third one in less than a year. Even with a protective case, the screen has broken and shattered. Could not do anything on screen, had to wait until battery died.
I love that it exists, per the cost of a Samsung Note, plus there isn't a 6-inch dual unlocked SIM phone available. But Oriental languages and shutdowns and Android Lollipop  (don't download) is the most annoying aspects of using this phone.
This is such a nice phone, has a great picture and lots of extra perks that most smart phones don't have. I highly recommend this phone if you have issues seeing small print. There are so many things it has to offer at the touch of one key.
I love my phone. The features are excellent and the camera is fantastic. Many people that see it are impressed by the size and graphics. Works great with my LG Bluetooth. I really don't have anything bad to say about this phone. GREAT BUY!
Update<br/><br/>I have had this phone for two weeks now. After calling to return and replace the defective phone. I. Must say I love this phone. The back camera is great the front could use some work must be in a well lit environment. Runs smoothly. Battery life last me at least 8 to 10 hours with gaming. (clash of clan type games). Longer without games. The speakers could definitely use an upgrade. I just use a Bluetooth headset. The wired headset is decent enough given the price.  The only issue I have encountered so far is that phone will power cycle itself if running multiple apps and one freezes or the phone hasn't been powered off in over a week. It has only happened once so far. I was worried about the battery not being able to be taken out but it had not been a problem.<br/><br/>Update.<br/><br/>Phone was great but apparently it was marked new when in actuality it was used. The charged provided did not work with the phone and would not charge. However returning and replacing with a new phone was very simple and only took 1 day.
Love my phone. Inexpensive and trustworthy. After chasing the expensive name brands finding BLU to work just as well and in some instances better. The software is different but basically does the same. Very pleased and will recommend.
The Blu phones are pretty good have no issues with the phone. Good quality pictures are decent. Anyone looking for a phone and don't want a contract and don't want to pay a lot money for a phone I recommend to check out the blu phones
I just love my blue 6.0 it arrived on time, just put my Sim cards I. From my other blu dash. d410 and it works perfect so far,  if there are any problems will up date later for now I am enjoying my new phone and loving the huge size.
Had this phone for about  6 weeks now. Pretty decent for the price. Had a galaxy note 2 prior. It is not the galaxy. But it does what I need ( talk, text, email, picture/video, etc...) Still figuring it out. But not a bad investment.
I like that phone, that is all
Took a whole night just to charge it and half of the time it wasn't even fully charged. And once it was on, it could only hold a full battery for at most 2 hours if you don't touch it. But if you use it, it'll die within 15 minutes.
worked great, nice and big. but it broke so easily. my mom dropped on her linoleum camper floor and the corner screen broke. She got a call the next day and it broke even more. just disappointed. other than that the specs are great.
i like the phone however it did not come with the memory SD card like it should have and it did not have the SIM card either. I went back and read the description and it was suppose to have those cards. Can you tell me what happen
My wife loves this phone.  She enjoys the large screen and uses it as both a phone and tablet.  She did say that it was a little large for a phone so we got her a bluetooth neck ear piece/microphone. It updated easily to Lollipop.
This is a great value. My wife loves it. I took a leap with a company I had never heard of and was more than pleased. There is nothing so far that she is not verry happy with including the software, battery life and construction.
My package never came so i had to get a refund from amazon and with that i ended up buying the phone on ebay and i must say it is a great phone works great very big screen with vibrant colors its awesome i recommend this phone!!!
on par with all the galaxy phones.  The facebook scrolling can be a bit jerky.  overall an amazing phone.  I was able to jump sprint and move to a prepaid wireless... hell i can try them all now ....Overall I highly recommend it
The touch sensitivity deteriorate as each day goes by, and the phone just passed out with this picture of the android guy gut-open and "no command" under...no warning,  can't turn off the phone or restart.  frustrating!
I really like this phone, its a few things about it that I don't like about it which is like when I'm on it all the time it freezes up and turns off and then turn back on. But other than that its a really a great phone to buy
Phone is fantastic!!!!  Maybe not as fast as an original but don't mind it for the price... Sturdy, feels sleek and looks great!!!  Apps were easy to download, facebook is easy to access, good quality sound...Enough said...
Works outstanding...definitely worth the price paid...its fast and the screen is perfect size for anything...smaller screen phones weren't cutting it with my big hands...fast and efficient...way to go with this phone BLU!!!
Awesome. Its big. Its fast. And it does exactly what I love. This phone is perfect for Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and MUSIC; which is what I'm really excite about. For under 150$, you cannot beat this deal. 👍👍👍👍👍
Only giving a 4 star rating , because the first one I orderd worked perfectly but I ordered another one and I wasn't able to use it because it had a bad MEI number . But I was able to send it back & receive another one .
delivery was on point . the phone works SUPER SUPER SUPER GOOD I recommend to anyone if your on a budget or not this phone is better than an iPhone . better than a Samsung . I will never go to another phone company again
Great phone works just as well as big companies  phones at half the price! No problems with it have had it for 6 or 7 months have even bought one for my little sister and my girlfriend! Would highly recommend to others!
Have bought 2 of these . only problem thus far is they both freeze up out of now where??? Trying to play a game and then zap! Freeze...screen goes blank and nothing? Would like feed back as to why. Updates were done...
Ok I bought three different BLU Studio 6.0, before I found one that works. I guess third time is a charm. Let me give the cons for the lemon phones . It's very buggy, it lags, the screen goes in and out. They are times where it will just go blank and not turn on. I had to keep rebooting it was so annoying, finally I return the phone. It would not read my sd card at times. The first one was from Amazon, LLC it was a black one and I return it. The second Black Studio 6.0 phone I order was from a company called Breed, it too had the same problem, I didn't want to give up on the phone because its a great price for what you get. It was so buggy, it was worse then the first one. So I return it, as well. So I finally said to myself buy a white Blu Studio 6.0 since the first lemons where black Studio 6.0 and bam it was a miracle. As soon as I got the white Blu Studio 6.0 it work perfectly. No issues the company that sold me the phone was Rush Direct. I dont know if you would have the patience like me to found the right one, but if you do, you will be happy. So fair warning there are lemons and you should read the bad reviews to see the actual issue so you know right hand what your dealing with. I am happy that I didnt give up on the Blu Studio 6.0
I love this phone, I have been using it for about 2 months and so far I haven't had any problems with it. I always have confidants in any Amazon fulfills. I know if there is any problem they take care of it very fast.
This is an update about the blu phone its 9/7/15. I have had it for about 4 weeks now. It's still a nice phone but I wanna point out some stuff. My battery was on 15% and I put it on the charge for not even 5mins and it said its at 67% :\.. also I turned my phone off one day to avoid a call and when I turned it on the screen was blue and had yellow Chinese writing. I have no idea what that was. Just hold down the power button to turn off the phone. Don't touch anything else. Because I was pushing buttons so I don't know what I may have done to my phone
Shipped as advertised. Basic android OS......not a removable  battery. Great screen size and color. ..locks up more than I would like.<br/>but for the price awesome. ..worked right out of the box with my AT&T;  Sim
Ok. I just bought this phone. I just turned it on to get internal battery to charge. Can't turn it off now. In couple days I'll go get my walmart family plan activated..please someone tell me what's going on.???
Love, Love the 6 inch screen works just fine about the size of the note 2 yes but I think I am going to get the 7.0 next.....Kinda hard to hear buy if you use the ear buds that come with it you will be fine.....
Even tho it's big it does what it says. The only thing I had a problem with was the virtual keyboard. It seemed like the keys was stuck. It keeps typing stuff I don't want it to type. Still a good buy for price.
I bought this phone and it was working fine until it got broken. Now the screen does not touch. I need to buy a screen or something but I don't know what to buy.  Can someone tell me what I need to buy, please?
This is a decent device with great functionality and ease if use. Responsive and photo quality is excellent, my only issue is the volume on the device is a bit low, particularly the audio from telephone calls.
I love everything about the phone. I broke my original and even purchased a replacement. He only problem I am having is my rear camera just randomly stopped working. Anybody know about this or a way to fix it?
I love this phone only con I found is the the volume is a bit low I use the head phone I can can hear loud and clear other than that it's perfect I'm buying for my family and I recommend this phone to any one
Beautiful large screen, good interface, easy to use.  But I've had trouble with the online media going out.  The sound on phone calls is very bad.  Hard to hear both ways.
Phone stopped working within a month and when I return it to the seller they want to charge me full price to fix it. Not worth it at all, money wasted!!!
The sim card occasionally slip out of place if you drop it. This means until it is place exactly in the right position and spot the phone will not work. Other than that every once and a while it works well.
Didnt like how when i has one SIM card in,  it would pop up saying something about the empty slot. And i had  a few issues at first with it registering on my network. Also, not the best with service issues.
I love my phone its works great and is very high in for the price only thing I don't like is that u can not assign ring tones to individual contact person but other than that no problems and would buy agin
The phone is not fancy but it is good. I text and play games and it is perfect. The phone was under $150 and totally worth it! The color is vibrant and the phone is well put together. I was very impressed.
This is my 2nd message. The phone does not work. The letters does not work , the N , A and C does nor work to send message. The battery does not hold the charge. I charge it all night and during the day.
After reading reviews of this phone, I took the plunge.  I couldn't agree more with the positive reviews of this phone.  Snappy and sleek will real estate on the screen to do what you will.  Great phone!
It met all my expectations
quick delivery great price, great phone,  be sure and put your phone in a case  these phones are big and easy to break  I have broken two this year  my fault for sure  so  make sure and invest in a case
I love this phone it's big and does everything I want it do. Every thing about this phone is great. I would recommend it to anybody. I just like the blu phones all of them because there reliable phones.
I really. Like this phone. It is a great size, it fits in my shirt pocket just fine. It is very fast, with 4 gb. Of internal memory free. That speed works great when paired to my car. And a good price.
It has only been six months and my phone isn't coming on. Can someone please help ........and its not because it needs charging. I hate having to write a negative comment but I need my phone to work.
Every piece of this phone was made in perfect condition. The only issue is that the memory slot drop away the device and somewhere in a day i need to remove it and insert the memory to reload again.
It was cool until I dropped it :.....(<br/>Still better than any phone i be had. Except the camera sucks especially the front camera. Don't look forward to selfies lol. Besides that.... I LOVED IT
Great value. The phone is great and I love the fact that its pure android. The price is impossible to beat. The screen is big and I highly recommend to any one looking for a good phone on a budget.
I received this item really fast and so far it has lived up to my expectation. I am really having fun with this phone to hell with Samsung and iPhone this phone is the real deal for less than $200.
I bought this for my adult son who doesn't have a credit card. I was impressed with the phone (I have a Galaxy Note 4), my son seems to realy like the phone and it has worked well for him so far.
I love this phone.  I use it on my Straight Talk account.  It has plenty of power and I use it for a backup for my tablet flight navigation software as it is good to have a backup in the plane.
This phone is everything the Samsung phones are except the price, which makes it better. Only thing I would change is the camera. It doesnt take the best pictures. The battery doesnt last long.
I ordered this phone for my daughter and she loves it after experiencing at least 3 different phone ordered from this site and all didn't worked right she is finally comfortable with this one!
My son uses this phone and he loves it! Zero complaints, great battery life, works seamlessly with our AT&T; plan. The big screen and display is "awesome" and bright , and it runs fast.
The phones appear to work great out of the box but last 90-120 days. As I mentioned in a previous review, Blu's customer's service sucks hind tit. Truly a disposable phone for short term use.
The phone is advertised as 4g when I connect to my provider which is metro PCs I realize it is 3g very disappointed, otherwise it's okaykj
This phone is what I expected.  Was pleased with the delivery - within the time. Only had it a few weeks so will review again  later. My only complaint is that I can't get WhatsApp to work.
its actually a lil too big. its impressive light and strong. the battery could last long her though but i do use the phone and internet a lot. overall good phone. lots of bang for your buck
I love this smartphone.  It is a bit smaller than a table and bigger than a regular smartphone.  This is great size and many of my friends want to buy.  I have to wait to install the apps.
I normally don't post reviews but ,this a nice phone, the only thing I hate it lags a little, and it to big I need a case so it want fall out my hands ,but you can't bet it for 150 dollars
Beware of products branded Blu.<br/>Had a very bad experience when it comes to customer support.<br/>They don't honor warranty issues.
Volume is too low. Phone will not let me answer calls && phone also gets too hot for no reason. Do not buy!!!!  Very disappointed !!!!
I love the phone, the syle is entirely beautiful, but i dropped it and it cracked. It's not a bad crack too, and more than half of my screen won't work. I can't even use it anymore xc
I love love love this phone, switching from an Samsung I was very please at what all this phone can do! The camera is awesome and I love the big screen which also shows very clearly.
not even deserve 1 star
Did not work right out of the box! The screen would freeze and the only way to recover was to reboot the phone. Shortly after reboot the screen would freeze again. Waste of money!
worse blu phone I've ever owned<br/>Loved the size, however it freezes and overheats.<br/>Where as a battery pull can help occasionally with such probs, this battery is built in
So far so good awesome phone for the price not a top end galaxy phone but for the price well worth it if you don't need all the extras you never use like a lot of the newer phones
I am so far happy with my phone which I purchased in April 2015. However I am not able to open downloads nor receive any photos through text message. What's up? Can anybody help?
Really love it. Down side it loses charging too fast and it needs more volume. I have to use ear phone to hear clearly sometimes. But its quite handy and visual qualities superb.
Hey, DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. PLEASE DO NOT! It's a waste of money. After just a month of use, it just shut off by itself, and dead for no reason. It was right there on my table.
The phone works perfectly I only have one issue, I want to know how to activate the led light notification when I receive messages the light does blink whenever I get a message
To date this has been a good cell phone choice for my wife who favors screen size over portability. The phone is perfect for her, too large to strap onto my arm for a run.
Was totally defective out of the box. Wouldn't boot, the camera started flashing by itself out of nowhere. It also doesn't have a removable battery, which isn't so great.
This was my second BLU Android smart phone, and it was not good. While the app and other internet features were good, the sound quality for talking and hearing were not.
Awesome phone for the money but three stars due to low volume when talking on phone for the hearing impaired . Even at full volume very hard to hear with my hearing aid.
Wonderful. Does everything what expensive smartphones do. Voice, video and sound qualities are good. It has a FREE GPS so we use it a lot for directions while driving.
I had this phone now for two days,  and so far I have any complaints about it other than the volume is a little low....I really love this phone I can't put it down!!!!
I love my phone! Large screen, nice camera and overall easy set up. My package got list in the mail and amazon looked out for me and sent my phone the very next day!!
My daughter love it..
Love it. Works with any phone company, has dual sim card availability for a second phone number. Works great. Can't ask for a better phone, especially at the price.
Came in great but now i know why the price is low not compatible with not much. android is not your friend with this phone.but it what you get for the price.It's ok
Phone arrived really quick! Its gorgeous. A bit big tho. But I knew that already when I bought it online. Works great so far and works on any SIM card or provider.
Very good phone especially for price only problem is their are no cases to protect it ... Other than that its great.
after one week I notice color line running throughout the phone  screen from the top to the bottom
I would love this phone but the microphone is not working. I need to get info on who to call about this problem. Can't talk to people when the microphone will not work.<br/><br/>So, I sent the phone back to BLU for repair and it worked when it was returned. About two weeks after it was returned, I got a notice of software upgrade for download so I started the download and it locked up. I tried putting it on my computer to access the memory card, I tried turning it off to reboot but it will not reboot. When I turn it on I get a list of options in maintenance but it will not operate. I think this phone is a dud.  I will try sending it back to BLU again but if you want reliable, this phone in my case is not reliable at all.
Screen sensitivity is awful, not responding to touch, everything has to be touched three to four times to respond, Battery life is not that good, had to return it
Enjoying my new phone,its the ideal phone for me. so far  only disappointed with the volume level and the battery rundown to fast other than that am well please.
If I take this phone outside of America to Africa(Nigeria) that has a higher electricity current 220volts as against America's 110volts, how is it gonna respond.
the phone is great my friend I bought it for loves it. The screen is big her boyfriend is currently experiencing some jealousy .She loves it and is very happy.
Just received and so far so good. Very easy set up and it took only eight minutes to upgrade to kit Kat. I will update with another review in a couple of weeks
It was a great deliver time but I only had it for three weeks and now people can't here me talk on my phone only on my blue tooth they can here me I need help
Only thing I don't like about it is it doesn't have text to speak, the blue tooth don't always connect, and my PayPal account won't connect to my phone number
I love this phone!!!
more than i expected
This was a gift. I'd have to say I'm impressed. Came as described. He loves it. It works great so far. Seller is awesome. Keep up the good work. 3 thumbs up
The phone is not good. I brought this phone. You can not hear clearly. It drops calls.  DO NOT BUY!!!!!! And the company would not refund your money.....
After you expand the memory on the phone to download your apps, turns out to be a good phone. Nice size as well. Just need cases to protect phone better.
NO!!! I started out liking the phone when I slipped in my old Straight Talk SIM and it immediately began working. I upgraded to kitkat through the settings menu and that was okay. Then the problems began. For 3 days I have been deleting emails from both pop 3 and webmail and THEY KEEP COMING BACK as unread mails!!! No matter what deletion method I tried. I cursed the software developers every time I read an email. But that is all moot, because the phone stopped working and I am sending it back. Tonight when I turned it on, the screen went to a DOS style menu, mostly in Chinese. It won't even shut off! The home keys don't even light up, but they will give me different Chinese menus. At one stop the flash kept shooting nonstop. Another gave me a high pitched scream. It is going back. I am hesitating if I should try a 5.5. Did I just hit a lemon?
Volume too los, mute after 3,4 minutes while talking on Bluetooth. Picture quality very impressive, screen size very handy didn't need glasses to see #s
Defective item, low incall volume, bottom part of phone does not work, and the notification light does not work. Phone does not read the memory card....
Tremendous phone for the price. No problems at all. Wish there had been a manual, but fun to play with and figure where things are and how to do things.
It is everything that is says I thought it was going to be cheap felling but its not it is very user friendly and very nice I would highly recommend it
phone was full charged then went dead and will not power up! this is  a big inconvenience. didnt expect this especially knowing this phone is not cheap
Everything about the phone is great but one thing.  Outside the US, it only gets 2G Internet which is super slow.  It would be the equivalent of saying you are taking me to the movies but we never go past the lobby.  I go into Facebook and can only see about 33% of the pictures.  If I want to read an article, it begins loading and just stops 33% of the way there.  The cell phone companies here say that this phone is not compatible with what they use.  So, at the end of the day, I bought two phones and can't use them.  Unless there is some alteration that I am unaware of, I am disappointed.  The phone works well but getting online, is a serious problem and that just happens to be the most important thing I need for business when I am away from the office and must reply on email, instant messaging services or text messages.
This product is pretty slim and flexible. It easy bend even while in your pocket. This happened to me within 7 days and warranty does not cover any damage. Though the phone is still in working condition but, BLU Studio is charging $104 for replacing the screen. That is too much, too bad. BLU Studio Customer service did not even reason with your explanation. There is no warranty policy on their website until when I complained before they post the warranty today in their own favor.<br/>This manufacturer did not sell warranty with this product because, they already knew that the product (BLU STUDIO 6.0 HD) will not last at all. If you check their website, a new product is coming soon, I believed it is mend to replace BLU STUDIO 6.0 HD. Watch out, you will see that they must have stop the production of BLU STUDIO 6.0 HD.
I would have to say I looked all around for the right phone and found it here only thing is my old sim card did not work but other then that awesome
Had to send back two phones and still have a problem with it I cant here some time take a long time to connect can barely here when talking on phone
I would like this phone a lot more if the speakers were better quality. I hate not being able to hear what people are saying or listening to music.
Purchased for my wife. Asked her if there are any compliant. She replied "I have no problem with it". If she loves it it must be a 5 star.
Bigger than i expected.. i thought it was going to be a bit smaller but its a big screen great camera.. i brought it for my father and he loves it
I like this phone a lot! Its bigger and cheaper that most phones. Plus its unlocked making it easy to simply place your Sim card in and that's it!
Had the phone for less than a month and the charge port broke. Spent a whole day getting another phone
If you want a budget large screen phone, you cannot beat this phone both for the price and the quality.  I have a nexus 4 and in side by side comparison this phone, this phone is double the nexus 4 size.  The only downside is that the nexus 4 has 2 gigs of ram where this phone only has 1.<br/><br/>The call quality is good, browsing the internet, youtube, music all works as it should. No 4g lte but I don't miss it because I've never had it.  Work flawless with my Chevy's Bluetooth, tethering, has sound profiles, fm radio, gps, etc.  BTW, the screen is beautiful.<br/><br/>I was leery to try this phone but I am so glad that I did.  I got the kitkat upgrade and it just enhanced it further. I haven't experience any of issues that others have mentioned.  I could go on and on but you should try it.
For the value of the phone it is a very good deal unlike an iPhone and Samsung,around 130.00 compared to $1000 for an iPhone or $700 for Samsung
I love my BLU works great. I like the pictures, enjoying the 6.0 screen. Would be nice if it had a bit more sound . But over all a great phone.
I recently purchased this phone only to found out that it now has  virus. I have a problem using Google Chrome and the Maps/GPS "sucks"
excelente producto
It's a grate phone
Its a built in battery so if it crashes it sticks and hard to reboot phone. BLU STUDIO WILL NOT HONOR WARRANTIES THEY ARE HORRIBLE, DON'T BUY, THEY WILL AND ARE THE MOST FRAUDULENT HORRIBLE COMPANY I HAVE YET TO DEAL WITH, WON'T LAST A MONTH, PROMISE!!
This is an incredible phone at an incredible price. My favorite phone so far! Super fast, vivid HD, does everything that the $800 phones do.
This phone completely exceeded my expectations, the only thing they could have done better is make a 64gb model.....I'd buy it instantly!!!!
This phone come right on time. No problem with is so far, it big. You can use it as a pre-paid if you want to. I use t-mobile as my carrier.
I received the product and I turn on...  But I notice that in the screen has two pixels lost...  One in the middle and one in the bottom...
OH MY GOSH!!!!!!!!! Can NOT say enough good things about this little gem!!!!!!  Buy one for yourself & you'll C what I am talking about! ;)
Phone came on time. Love it!!! Easy to use, sometimes hard to hear because its big and I am just not used to it ...but overall no regrets!!
Really great phone! Better than expected! Only downside would be the volume, it's low even when set to the maximum. Good purchase overall!
We are very excited about these phones, they worked right out the box with out any problems, plus they hold the charge for a long time !!!
This is great but the input for any charger is loose so make sure it's charging because this is my alarm and Luckily I wake up without it.
The first phone did not work,. I have sent it back, I am ordering another one becasue I really liked the phone. I hope it works this time
if you need a phone and don't want to pay a big amount for one then the blu 6.0 is the phone for you!!! I'm In love with it 😃😃😃😃😃😃
I don't know if I received a dud.. This phone sucked right out of the box. The screen was unresponsive 90% of the time. It dialed characters and numbers out of nowhere. Rebooting and restoring the phone was a waste of time. I'm currently waiting for a replacement and if that one does the same thing I will be returning that one too.<br/>Update: I received a replacement today and I have to admit the phone isn't too bad. It's not the Galaxy 4 that I owned but I can deal with it. Update two weeks later and the screen don't light up when u press the power button. I am returning this model. However I am going to try one more time with a different model nd if I have problems with that one I will never buy a blu phone again. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PHONE.<br/>Pros: Big Screen<br/>Cons: NOT A GOOD PHONE, A Little Heavy, Low Speaker Volume
The best phone ever! I've downloaded books & magazines into this phone & it works great! The perfect balance between a phone & a tablet!
I was very surprise with this phone screen is bright, works great with 4.4 kit kat this phone is big real big I quit using my I pad mini
This is a great phone love it. The screen is very clear and clean. This was my upgrade from the Galaxy S3 and Iove this phone to death.
Still learning features...overall everything seems to be working just fine except for my internet--doesn't work that well in most areas
The phone is really big & it's nice for the price. Works great. Just don't like the integrated battery but overall I like the product.
very fast shipping , phone is ok processor is a little slow hard to hear when on the phone but was very inexpensive . There ya go.....
I'm in love with phone so much so, that I have told several people about it and they have bought it from Amazon right then and there.
been using this phone about 2 months.  works great.  no problems.  quick delivery.  beautiful picture/resolution.  best deal around!
yes.blu is it good phone dont need to buy explensive phone my 6'0 blu stodio work perfect just like samsung galaxy  i love it thanks
Excelent unlocked cellphone,works perfectly with metro pcs,nice screen resolution,beatiful camara,and very happy with this android,
The phone is everything its advertised to be. Its large display is easy to see and it functions beautifully. I am glad I bought it.
I bought this phone for my friend. she confirmed that this phone meet up the standard<br/>she wants. she loves this phone so much.
The worst phone ever!!!! Buyers beware. Three months later and I cannot use this phone. :(
The blu phone was everything that i expected, but it is no way that you can see the numbers that was deleted or dialed and erased.
i love the phone but just one problem I have with it, its the volume.When I am speaking to  someone ,it's difficult to hear them.
The phone arrived on time however, after about one week of using it, the phone stopped working I can't figure out what went wrong
Overall it's a good product, only issue is that it doesn't holds charge well all the time(10%),but holds it well most times(90%)
I initially was going to return But I decided to keep product.  When I received it it looked great and worked perfectly.  thanks
Great phone.....
Excellent phone!
No I'm not satisfied with this phone it turn off by itself and their was no receipt in their for me to contact or send it back
My only problem is the over heating ...but its a good low cost phone ...has the same features as any high end expensive phone.
The phone had a failure recently, but apparently already solved , so far I liked it , but I hope it does not get damaged soon.
I can not get this phone to work with straight talk I have bought the straight talk kit and it want work I want my money back.
Screen is weak I'm replacing mine for the second time in less than two months no drops or falls in a case with 360 protection
NOT A REVIEW OF THE PHONE: I did not receive the 6.0 but the BLU Studio 5.0 LTE .....Returning and will Try my order again !
This android gives a whole lot of features at a much cheaper cost. The picture quality is great and I love the screen size.
Phone LCD screen converter shut down on me within 3 weeks and the phone is horrible.
Absolutely fantastic phone!!! One of the most advanced I've ever had. And it's enormous. Buying one for my fiance as well.
I FREAKING LOVE THIS PHONE IT'S BY FAR THE BEST PHONE I'VE EVER HAD AND FOR IT'S PRICE YOU WON'T FIND A BETTER PHONE
Just the size that I always wanted to hAve lo ing it just as I expected. I am still adjusting myself to this phone.
Its good so far,the only problem I have is that it freeze so time not far long..I would recommend it to my friends.
Really Nice phone for price I have the black 1 and my gf has white color she loves it watch her show on it all day.
Great phone. No need to waste ur $on a galaxiy or iPhone that's stupid. This phone works great love it huge screen
Great HD camera. Faster than cheap smart phones. And cricket will not service the phone so don't bother with them.
So far I'm loving it!  The hd picture is fantastic.  Still learning the phone,  but I think this will be a keeper!
In all ways the Blu 6.0 appears to be equivalent or supierier to the Samsung Note. Excellent Display. Fast phone. Update: Ordered a 2nd phone, and about to order a 3rd. Absolutely  then best smart phone for the money I have found. Do order a protective silicone case and screen protectors with it, as the ones that come with the phone are inadequate in my opinion.
I purchased this BLU 6.0 it is awesome at less than half the cost of my HTC one. BLU should have a bright future.
I hate this phone it cuts off, it freezes blu is not worth my money 😠😠😠😠
I love the phone.. Just have difficult with hearing my caller at time and the phone freeze up sometime too..
Good picture no issues with software does what I need it to do. Only wish I could get an otter box for phone
They work very good, it was well worth every bit of the price, these are $350 we got it really fast as well.
I was unable to have ATT help me install their SIM card.Phone started in Airplane Mode. Got stuck there. BLU Customer Service (per ATT) keeps "bankers' hours and are no help. Seems nobody knows how to activate, nor operate this unit. Finally figured out where the AT&T; Sim goes. NO HELP FROM MFG !!Unbeleable for a company as huge as BLU making rapid progress in the USA. No Support??<br/>Does anyone know how to contact them?? Phones are cheap, but need to be backed up by mfg !!Does anyone have a clue? Or is this a rip-off?? Any leads will be appreciated! Thanks in advance!
Great phone!  Puts my iPhone 4S to shame!  Awesome display. And android is so customizable compared to iOS.
I've bn using the phone for a month and it works well thus far however I just need to get use to the size.
So far so good, need to observe it if something is wrong, i need to return it but so far nothing is wrong.
Hi, I was disappointed with the phone because it's touch screen stopped working after I sent it to Africa.
Love this phone! Perfect for me, meets all my expectations! Would recommend to anyone! Thank you so much!
This phone do just what it says, overall it is a good phone......but the sound could be a little louder.
I wanted a 4g phone didn't realize this is a 3g phone any way I can send it back for a 4g of equel value
I really like this phone and the at and t is great. 4g. all is great would highly recommend this phone.
Only bad thing had to press really hard for any operation on phone:(
Great product. Worth the money. Very cute to behold. I will recommend to anyone who likes good things.
So far I am very impressed after less than a day.<br/>I am able to install and use many more apps than my previous entry-level smart phones.<br/>The screen is bright and clear and very responsive.<br/>The only thing that didn't work was a 16gb micro sd card that I moved from my old consumer cellular phone. An 8gb card I moved from my Canadian phone worked fine. The Consumer Cellular SIM card worked perfectly. I'll know if the Canadian SIM card works in a month, but it is easy to tell the phone to switch between the two installed cards.
I'm looking to buy 3 more blue family and for is asking for this blu because they are doing fantastic
This phone is crap,this is the second one I bought in less that a year and neither is working anymore
problems with charger where you plug in usb micro no warranty the company  another 62 box to fix that
I've had it for a few days now and I love this phone. So happy its compatible with my phone provider.
So far I am loving this phone .After getting the VPN SETTINGS RIGHT , iT'S AWESOME WITH STRAIGHT TALK
Good for the price.  Love the screen, I don't believe it is an LTE but for the price can't complain.
Enjoying it everytime I've got it in my hands. Features are cool and the apps. Love the screen size.
I can say is a good Phone, but also is not for my use, I can't say much, but I loved it the look!!!!
Just a little bigger than I expected, but performs well, has what a non-tech person can use. Thanks
Great phone so far I have order 5 of the 5.0 and 2 of the 6.0 and I will be ordering a couple more.
phone is garbage takes forever to load very laggy also restarts on its own definitely not worth it
The BEST phone, and for a very cheap price. I will only buys phones from this company from now on.
I love this phone the only thing I don't like is I can't figure out the microphone to talk to text
Why is the call volume so low when on the phone? What can you do about that? To enhance the volume
Does the job
excellent, high quality phone can match with samsung and iphone. but the price 3-4 times cheaper.
Delivery time was great, and the phone was worked great, my only problem is that it overheat alot
This phone really surprised me. The camera is very good, phone is very fast and my wife loves it.
I luv my phone!!! And my sister, my brother and my son have one because they liked mine so much.
The phone arrived earlier than I expected!<br/>I am having an issue with the volume and it doesn't  matter if I put in on Speaker, it still is not loud enough for me to hear with ease or without straining.  Is there something I can do to remedy this?<br/>The one other small issue is that when charging the phone, the plug has to be pushed in tight, if not it won’t charge.  (There is no wiggle room.)<br/>I am in love with the size of the phone as well as the camera.<br/>Battery life seems to be fine.
Very pleased with my purchase meets my needs and expectations easy to set up good functionality
This is an amazing phone! I am so impressed with the quality and affordability of this product.
This is my second review.  I've had this phone for a few weeks now. I still like it, but I do have a couple of concerns.  The speakers are not very good I can't hear unless I have head phones and it doesn't have voice command. Is there having volume issues?
Great phone love it! It's huge OMG a like heavy but I love it. Big bright screen runs perfectly
I luv this phone. Only problem I have with is that u didn't know it was this big... . #myfulit
the phone does not have wireless network support. You can not connect to any wireless network.
Love the size and how it works it took a few days and then it updated it my favorite phone yet
Overall it is a good phone. Volume is a bit low when watching movies have to put in headphones
Really big but i brought this for my boyfriend cause he likes big phones for the screen size..
Phone is great. No negatives.  Pictures good, video good. I love the size...not fat, not slim.
This is the second Blu phone I've purchased and I regret it.  The first one - Studio 5.5 - would not let me download ANYTHING - no apps, no updates.  It had a 64G SD card in it!  And every download I attempted I got the message "insufficient storage space."  I've had the 6.0 for mere days and already I'm having issues i.e. my internet will not work.  It worked for the first few days, now all of a sudden, no internet.  Even when I'm at home with my own wifi network.  Very frustrating.
Amazing and good cellphone wonderful I m happy to got it all facility available in this phone
The best for the price, the battery never dies on my day even two days can last on light duty
keeps shutting off on my when phone updates and shuts off no matter were im at in the house..
I love this phone I was always a samsung galaxy fan but when I got this one I like it better
Phone was delivered quick. But would not pick up signal and a tower is 1 mile from my house.
love my studio screen is super clear camera is awesome the battery life is kinda lacking tho the dang lollipop update sux and when I contacted blu about it they want me to. Pay to ship it and pay to have kk4.4 back on it what a crappy update it turned my loved device into a brick as far as I'm concerned and it isn't but a few months old and they want me to pay to have it reprogrammed was thinking of upgrading to a lte version now I'm not so sure that blu products needs my money anymore
Every thing good except that its speaker sound is small even turn on to the maximum volume.
The first one could not charge on same day. Second one/replacement could not charge again.
Awesome phone...You cant go wrong !!!!! hooked up with straight talk and it is amazing!!!!
Hearing incoming calls is very difficult even though  the volume is turned all the way up.<br/>I constantly have to ask the person I am talking to, to repeat a sentence or a word because it is so difficult to hear what they are saying.<br/>I don't understand how the makers overlook such an important feature.
Great phone... if I have No problem it's good because I am a heavy user¡!!!!!!!!THANKS BLU
Phone is okay for its price. the internet does not work unless am connected to my WiFi.<br/><br/>phone dropped and it got a slight crack on the up left side of the screen (looks more like a scratch then a crack). with that said only the first 2 inches of the phone works now.<br/>was not a dramatic drop. either<br/>just had it for 4 months.<br/>my husband had one as will and the web was not working as well unless he was connected to are WIFI.<br/>GPS is also a joke.
Great phone
GREAT, phone. Nice screen PERFECT for some who wants to watch shows and movies on the go.
Was a great phone but after about 2 months of use it stopped charging and wouldn't charge
Does this phone come with any cases if not where do I get one and how much would it cost?
I ordered the white phone and received the black phone. Other than that I like the phone.
Very nice phone except for the headphone volume. That's why I gave it four stars. Enjoy.
The product received was not selected and it is lower cost and technical specifications.
Awesome phone work excellent and lived up to all of the specs. Would def purchase again!
Love my phone. The picture quality is clear and takes great photos at nights. Thumbs up!
beautiful finish, great screen, fast phone, amazing photos, dual sim is great. excellent
Before to request the Studio 6.0 HD I thought that the cellphone could looks like a Chinese smartphone but reviewing the comments I became convinced that cover all my expectations...  I was wrong, the Studio 6.0 HD looks great!, I have 1 week with the cellphone and it's awesome. the pictures, the speed, the network connection is 4G LTE... I'm using the cellphone with Metro PCS  (T-Mobile) and I'll check the another sim with Telcel connection. 100% recommended.
My husband loves the phone the only issue he has is opening up his Amazon kindle books.
I purchased this phone as with good hope BUT it did not work at all. After 7 days of so it went into Chinese mode. I could not do anything with it at all. I could not reset, start or do anything. I got another phone as a courtesy and did same as first and got BLU ...which is the 3rd from Amazon that also did same as other two did previously. It is a CRAP.....I have wasted my money and could not use the services for the time I paid to service provider.
great phone!! me and my husband both got one and both agree that its perfect for us.
I love this phone works really great love the size has been no problems to me love it.
Overall the phone is very nice but the only thing I wish for that the phone was 1080p.
the phone started to run hot and keep turning  off and deleting the suff  on my phone
So far so good. I please with the purchased and the I received the cell in good time.
Can not use with Verizon make sure of ghz the provider operates on is equal to phone
this was a perfect buy, it came on time and it works perfectly fine great buy!!!!!!
Do NOT purchase this phone.  After less than one month the dial pad isn't working.
Great phone, easy to use and perfect size.
THIS BEAUTIFUL PHONE WORTH EVERY PENNY. FANTASTIC PHONE. I PICK IT OVER MY NOTE 2.
Pop card in, activated, added Google account(or you can skip) and boom! Awsomeness
I Haven't Had My Phone A Full Month And My Screen Has Completely Stopped Working .
I love the phone. I just don't like the fact that I can't find accessories for it.
Great phone for a teen if your not willing to get them a high dollies smartphone.
I bought this product thinking that it's the best thing ever after a couple of days it worked fine and then glitches really showed after the phone with me even staying on all the time it will reboot the screen wouldn't recognize my fingers touching it the program is a third party the software's this supposed to be some supplied for this phone when update the customer service for this phone is terrible do not buy at all
Amazing phone with great specs but still I have to change its defective battery.
For a quad core without bloatware installed it is easily bogged down by apps. It has better reception than my iPhone 4s did. The audio is horrible.<br/>Making a regular phone call is extremely hard to hear compared to any phone I have ever had but is just fine via Bluetooth. It don't interface well with Ford/Lincoln MyTouch/Sync. The phone controls do not display phonelist, incoming or outgoing calls or contacts.
I am in love with this phone! Compares easily with the Samsung galaxy.<br/><br/>Pros: Price, Dual sim cards, easy to connect with no contract service provider, size, built in call recorder, hot spot, graphics...I could go on for days.<br/><br/>Cons: Speaker volume is very poor. I have tried different settings, but no luck.<br/>I use the my bluetooth  most of the time, and it is not a problem for me.
return because it will freeze up and get too hot, a good buy if it improves.
It was excellent everything was on time, thanks keep up the great work
Phone came in two days which is good I haven't had any problems so far
Does what it says . Good phone so far ! no problems. Would buy again!
Great phone!!! Ear speaker is a little low but all in all great phone
Loving my new phone. Will update as I adjust to it. So far soo good.
I would like to return this item<br/>As it is not working properly.
Great phone for a good price.  Only thing missing is the voice text.
So far I'm very much satisfied. Key board functions could be better.
Just received phone its been a week things are great I will update..
Crashes and turns off by itself. Returned.
EXCELENT
excelent
This phone sometime freezes and take a long time yo get it working
Absolutely love this phone. Up there with the popular name brands.
These phones are awesome. They run circles around the phone I had.
freezing on and off send it back until now I didn't get my refund.
Does what I need.  Once I got the SIM card working, it works fine.
Wasn't sure what to expect but I'm loving it no problem right now.
this phone is not starting what will I do
THIS PHONE IS FREAKING AWESOME!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>HANDS DOWN!!!!
It has become my new toy, the camera is so clear , I am loving it
Pretty nice phone. Wish it had more memory and a faster processor
its very pretty I love my phone and yet to discover more about it
Look great, feel great and work like one of the name brand phone.
I am not really happy with the volume.  I wish it would be louder loop
The charger stops working within two weeks of getting the phone.
Love my new phone i can see and type !!!!  Blu Studio 6.0  !!!!
I found that the charger issued with the phone was not working.
Excellent phone... back camera perfect.. selfie camera not good
Call quality is extremely poor. Calls sound muffled or distant.
Phone with good price, however the battery discharges too fast!
i just got my phone in  feb and i loved it at first now out of no where it has stop working with no notice of anything wrong ,just stopped and never turned back on so of course i cant seem to get in contact with anyone about a replacement..... so just save your money ,now i have a brand new phone that no one can fix
thanks so much it came on time going to activate it next week.
How can one change the battery for the blu studio 6.0 HD phone
Best 6" phone on the internet unless you want to pay 500+.
Great Phone definitely worth the price and a nice screen size
no warranty on the phone,cannot get it repaired after 30 days
Speaker need improving but other then that it's a great phone
Great phone for little money. Camera could be a little better
Works good but the speakers are not loud enough during calls.
My Family Loved This Phone So Much That We Got three Of Them.
Its a good buy.  I'll recommend it to anyone wanting a phone.
I find the touch isn't perfect, but for the price, I love it!
Thought size and everything I read was great.<br/>Product was very poor, lasted one day at the most.<br/>Screen went to "fail/pass/back mode and would not let me shut system off or reboot.<br/>Really surprised as I expected a great product.<br/>Glad I purchased it from Amazon, as it was an easy return
works good--great deal for the price!
Like the design and the camera. The sound is not that great.
Internet sucks keeps freezing and phone calls go in and out.
The phone froze up. Doesnt work better then the older models
I have researching this phone for almost 6 months. And I've had great reviews from people. So I bought two one for myself and one for my husband, I must say This phone rates up there with the Samsung notes. The only difference is that it's doesn't have a pen to it. But the rest is A1. LOVING THIS PHONE.
Worked great for me and gets great service with Ptel MOBILE
Too large for the women, had to return for a 5" Studio.
Cannot get apps to download to micro sd card at all!!!  Becareful when turning phone on, it will go to root mode and leave you stuck there untill you learn chinese to figure out how to logout!!!!!!! Recording sound for video in phone is very very low!!!  And lastly, it says 4G, but its a LIE!!!!!
thank u
IT'S A GOOD TELEPHONE BUT I HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE TOUCH SCREEN
my review of the phone is 2 star not the screen pro tector
everything about it is OK apart from the volume is too low
My wife loved the phone. It is amazing. Worth each dollar.
Excellent phone for the price.... It's more that i expect
The phone is working just fine. No problem/s with device.
I wish I had three of these phone just for the hell of it
I received the phone on time, and I would purchase again.
Husband got this for replacing a Studio 5.5 d610a because the screen went blank. Square Trade refunded full purchase price and he got this 6.0 HD in October 2014. Unfortunately the buttons are bad layout, they can accidentally throw you into hard reset or service mode. The battery life is not tremendous if you use data, won't last a day without full recharge. The screen is excellent HD but power-hungry and eats the battery up fast - more pixels - dual SIM is nice, uses Consumer Cellular SIM, just like the Studio 5.5 d601A did. It came with Android 4.2 and then was due for an update to 4.4. After the update to 4.4 things got weird soon after. Tried hard reset. Nothing was the same. You opened an app and it wouldn't close without a hard reboot, all the way EACH TIME, EACH APP. You have to reboot each time you open an app!!! Phones calls were okay. Speakers not as good as studio 5.5 d610A, you have to turn it upside down to really hear it. Came with a great camera, a nice gel case, screen protector, headphones - but nonetheless...we have to replace this phone now, too - and just got in October. That's a ton of work, new warranty, transfer all the data and contacts again...blah blah blah. Looked at Studio 7.0 - ordered one, it got lost, amazon sent a replacement but it was faulty. Then the lost package showed up and IT WAS ALSO FAULTY. chinese language on screens! didn't recognize Consumer Cellular carrier SIM GSM - not sure what to do now.
Operating system tends to lag alot even when using WiFi.
I absolutely love my phone. So glad that I purchased it.
Don't purchase this phone its junk it andit froze up on me and I could not touch the screen or do anything I did a hard reset and it never worked every game I had to call a manufacture to get it replaced and I don't know if they're going to replace it or not but this phone is junk
This is a good deal for the price, and works very well. Its a large screen, well made, responsive, and looks great. For us, its a back up phone / game portal for the kids, and its perfect for that and can do a lot more. If you are looking for an affordable smart phone, get this.
Not a good phone to get at all if u get it u will b mad
Speaker quality is very bad.  Couldn't hear the caller.
I just recieved this phone this week.  Immediately did the factory update to kitkat 4.4 and I love it.  I have yet to get service on it, as I am waiting for straight talk to port my existing phone number.  Once I get used to the phone and start using it daily, I will update.
I loved this cellphone! Great video and audio quality.
Love it! Order the phone on a Friday got it on Monday.
It's good .just gets stuck sometimes. Could be better.
Great phone, great price fast shipping very satisfied☺
great phone. I love it I'd recommend to anyone to buy.
Great phone!! Couldn't have asked for anything better.
I thought that I would be able to use this phone with Verizon but could not. When I typed in Verizon phones and Blu popped up. Was so excited about this phone but realize that it might not work. If anyone know how I can use this phone PLEASE let me know.........Not happy
Wouldn't read my sim nor SD card
Good phone but the touch screen isn't very responsive
in love with this phone and eazy hook up with cricket
Received the phone on time. Really good phone but upon using  it found out the mic in phone,didn't work only way to talk to someone was to use the headphones. Storage is adequate HD is awesome, rateing this phone 4 out of 5 stars only because of mic not working.
I love this phone, for the price you can't beat it
Love it.. One of the best phones I've had in years
I like the phone.  However, the UNLOCK is not available with Verizon.  One SIM Slot 1 GSM is an error "NO SIM CARD" SIM card Slot 2 USIM.  I went back to my old phone and the SIM is still good..  I wish I can get Verizon or BLU will work..
DO NOT GET THIS PHONE. I HAVEN'T HAD MINES FOR TWO MONTHS AND IT COMPLETELY STOPPED WORKING!!!!! THE VOLUME CONSTANTLY WENT OUT ON THE PHONE. I COULD ONLY USE T WITH EARPHONES BEFORE THE SCREEN WENT COMPLETELY BLACK. THIS WAS A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY
Just love this phone! Good price and good quality
Great phone.  Light weight and nice large screen.
I have this phone and I absolutely love it......
I love it, Its all I thought it was going to be.
Very satisfied with the product and the delivery
Very nice Device, and it works in Latin America.
Love the phone and love the price even better
It was a gift for my boyfriend and He love it
Works like a charm with Straighttalk service.
Cool-Big display, sharp! Works good so far...
Phone stop charging after a week of using it.
This is a great smartphone for a great price!
IT WORK FINE BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN IT FREEZE
my son bought me this phone for mothers day May 2015, its now two months later July 2015. the phone just stop working its gone black was on it on minute the next its off wont charge wont power off.... terrible terrible....
This is one of the best phones I have owned.
It is really nice! I will buy it once again!
My son love this phone, best phone from blu
This EXCEEDED my expectations. I LOVE IT!!!
I love this phone haven't had any issues...
Awesome phablet. You won't be disappointed!
Terrible.  It wouldn't turn on or charge right out of the box.  Since I live in South America there wasn't much I could do.  It cost me $80  to fix the resistance which was faulty.  Truly a disastrous purchase.
This phone cost less than the basic Samsung I purchased 2 years ago!  It's sooooo  much better!! May not have as much internal memory as other comparable phablets out there, but that hasn't been an issue yet.
good good five star
lollipop was installed in cell phone......
Love this phone! It's everything I wanted.
Very satisfied, reached on time, thank you
These phoned are not good I brought 2 and they will not stay charge, they charge on charger then the u put your sim card in it and it dies. Made no cents at all. But at least I did get my money back<br/>.
For the money this phone goes a long way!
The phone speaker doesn't work but it's.
The phone is great and so was the price.
love the phone no doubts about buying it
I love this phone. I don't believe in contract phones they cost to much. This phone works with my straight talk Sim. I had no problem with the Bluetooth. You can't beat this phone for this price.
It doesn't keep charge had to return it
It keeps restarting or freezing it self
Awesome phone worth more than the money
Don't buy this one the 5.0 is better...
Excellent goods! It is pleasant to use.
Great  unlocked  phone  for the price .
because on 30th day my pone goes off by himself, i try to contact with amazon but i do not find any way to contact with them. I hope some one should contact with me to  solve this problem.
The audio is not good but great screen
I love my phone.  That's all I can say
Returning no longer working correctly.
I've been getting a lot of compliments
Do this work for simple mobile service
Signed up for an Amazon card, got the phone overnight for under $60.  So far happy with it. It came complete with a case and screen protector.. If you keep it lit have a charger handy.
Inexpensive masterpiece of technology
Excellent product, very good quality!
Very Good and cheaper Unlocked mobile
Can't hear out of phone volume to low
The hearing volume is not that great.
Very good phone comparable  to galaxy
Everything I wanted for a great price
Yes everything and more great product
Thanks quality and service was great!
Will this work simcard in philippines
The phone is excellent, I am comparing it to my Samsung S111, the only thing I find is that the volume is low when receiving calls. Can someone tell me how to increase the volume.
Phone turned on and there was like Chinese writing on the screen,  can't get to menu to change anything,  phone will not turn off, just bad experience, I had to call the seller
It is a really gud phone straight up
Very good phone. My mom was pleased.
Thank's. Cover up mine expectatives.

Great phone for an awesome price
I'm in love for a low price!!!!
Excellent Product !!! i love it
Phone gets to hot when charging
its good but not as Good as 5.0
I love my BLU smartphone device
I bought this phone not too long ago and I started to have problem with it. Gallery is not working. I will not recommended this phone to any one.
This is a really nice phone, but don't try to do a direct compare with the top phones from Apple or Samsung.  This is exactly what it claims to be, a good phone with capable features, running on a steady Android platform and a "no frills" build.  Things like a battery that a user can not replace indicates that this really is meant to be bought, used and thrown away after a few years.  Which is okay - by the time the battery cycles down you will want a new phone and BLU will be there with another value priced model.<br/><br/>Nice - runs Android so it will be familiar to anyone who has owned a previous smart phone, plus it will be easy to learn for a new user.<br/>Big, and I mean huge - screen!  Great for tired eyes and great for younger video hungry users.<br/><br/>Downsides?  A few..  the touch screen is not as sensitive as others and this can get a bit annoying at times when you are trying to navigate your way around.  Also, the "Back" button is on the lower left of the phone as opposed to Samsung which is on the lower right.  Why does this matter?  Well the screen is so large that right hand users now require two hands on the phone to go "back" (right hand to hold it - left hand to toggle).
I have big problem my has not come on since I got it . is it that it doesn't work or it needs to charge for a few  hours . I need some answers.
I love this phone great price.
It's  good phone for the money
Great phone and great features
Love the phone, price is good.
Like it said vibrant and fast
I had this phone got a week.
Good phone.  Uses more data.
Not what I expected, I'll go back to my Samsung Galaxy s6...... I have to tap the screen several times before getting what I need.
Had issues. Died .. Black screen with in 2weeks. Also on studio 6 the battery is imbedded. No way to remove. I'm back to 5.5studio
This phone is not what I expected..it takes bad pics, and it doesn't let me make calls sometimes I regret spending $149 on this
Thanks a lot..........great
BUEN PRODUCTO. RECOMENDADO.
Good android for the price.
so nice had to buy it twice
lots a room for improvement
Amazing and it's affordable
Great phone I'd buy another
good phone very easy to use
It's affordable and  nice..
Excellent.  My son loves it
i am not able to get 4g network on the phones. Internal capacity lesser than what is on the label. This is very bad business
the phone had a bad pixel screen, i cant write  p letter. i cant return because i am from venezuela, so expensive shipping.
Well the only issue I have is the keypads are hard n requires more pressure n strength to press. Hope BLU looks into this.
It was perfect . I love it
so far so good. works fine
Its better than expected .
Great phone for the price.
Love my new studio blu 6.0
My husband loves his phone
Great phone for the price.
good phone not enough info
Great phone easy to set up
Great for the price! Not the best performance but that happen because of the big screen!<br/>Already upgraded to 4.4.2!
It is bigger than I thought. The only thing I don't like is that the headphone jack only works with the BLU headphones.
two or three times a day my smartphone restarts for no reason. Because of Android or phone ? Amazon can have it back.
great size and resolution
works good , I like that.
More then I was expecting
This phone is fantastic!
Great phone I recommend.
Was a gift for two of my kids in Africa, and now everyone close to us wants to have it. Outstanding product.
It was very good phone.
I love this cell phone.
Great phone.. love it!!
Everything looks great.
I'm loving my new phone. It's everything I expected to be...I really bought it for the size of the screen.
Good phone at the price. It has many features including two sims. The color of the telephone are bright.
This phone is awesome!
Great phone and tablet
Great phone good deal.
At to this moment yes!
Nice phone worked well
Awesome phone love it.
Better than I expected
its a wonderful gadget
Husband loves the size
Best Phone I ever had.
I'm just not a fan. I mean, it's a great phone if you don't want a contract; it works extremely well with StraightTalk, and I rarely have a dropped call. However, it's too big; I found myself fumbling all over the place while trying to use it. I wanted a larger screen, and it certainly has that--too large. It's like holding a plate up to your head. :) My biggest issue is the lack of memory. It says it's a 16gb phone, however, at 2gb it tells you you're out of memory, and you find yourself stripping it down to the basics.<br/>The speed is fine; the display is sharp. The camera sucks, and that was an important feature for me. If you don't have a tablet, and you don't mind holding  plate up to your head, it's fine. If you need something that allows you to reach key buttons quickly, and that's of a fairly intuitive design with large memory, it sucks.
This phone is amazing
Best phone I ever had
All good but weak GPS
Ok it replaced my 5.5
Great phone I love it
Everything was ok. :)
Better than expexted.
It's OK can be letter
Very good cell phone.
awesome phone love it
DO NOT BUY!!!! ! The biggest piece of crap  I've ever bought.  After using it for a week,  it suddenly completely died on me.  It wouldn't turn on at all.  I decided to send it back to the Repair Dept and took them A MONTH to fix it and ship it back to me!  They did not give me a brand new replacement.  BLU is cheap.  They try to fix your phone,  they wouldn't give you a new one.  So I got the phone back and not even a little over a week after waiting for it for so long,  the problem arises again!!!!! I tried to call their howling but they never answer! They only respond through email which is so shady.  Mind you,  I did not drop it EVER. I didnt get it wet or get it overcharged.  This is just a piece of crap and I'm so mad at myself for not buying a phone from a more trusted brand.  Again, I can't say this enough!  Don't buy!  !
Great phone very big
I loved this product
It is working great.
Very good works well
Sd card will not stay in place so apps like amazon or audible will randomnly lose their libraries forcing you to redownload everything.  Battery life is wonky.  Originally stayed at 74% forever then died so you never get a clear feel of how much battery life you have.  Now the battery has decided to go pretty much completely out aftter about 5 months.  Charges upto 100% then will die  without being used.  The seller New Age products only gives you 2 months to return the product so that should tell you something right there.  When operational it still very slow on waking and basic functionality is not very snappy.  Overall great concept and i hope that I just got a dud but if i were you look into Moto G or E.  Screen is only slightly smaller but better specs and much better warranty.
It don't do anything it just big. My phone don't even work any more haven't had it a month
Very quick sending it out and receiving the item also happy with the phone and satisfy..
I love  it
Cool toy for adult.
excellent recommend
great phone love it

Very Good Phone..
Bought this phone October of 2014, worked beautifully clear pics, long battery life, responsive to data based apps ( I/E Netflix, YouTube, OoVoO etc....then about 1 monthlater...S#*! HITS THE FAN AND THE BUTTONS ON HOME SCREEN DONT WORK, BATTERY LIFES GETS S***TY, PHONE ACTS SLOW, oh and not to mention the cherry on top of the problem.... LETS NOT FORGET AFTER YOU TAKE THE PHONE OFF THE CHARGER AND TRY TO TURN YOUR PHONE BACK ON IT GOES A A SCREEN OF A GODFORSAKEN LANGUAGE I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO TRANSLATE.....this phone has MAJOR PROBLEMS.....DO NOT BUY THIS ITS A WASTE OF MONEY AND FEELINGS YOUR BETTER OFF SAVING UP AND GETTIN A SAMSUNG THATS WHAT IM BOUT TO DO
I got this phone for my brother. It is awesome! don't spend 700 on phones!
Love this phone.
the best product
Excellent phone.
Best phone ever.
Very good indeed
So far so good..
Love this phone.
Excellent! !!!!!
The phone is very good in quality and I love the battery life. It will give you 1.5 to 2 days of normal to moderated use.<br/>The screen is bright and colors are very good. I bought it for $160.00 and i might buy for my teenager sons. I'm with T-mobile in Dallas Texas, and I'm getting good 4G (not LTE) signal. Most phones are 3G in this price range and 4G is very welcome. The phone has about 2g internal memory after Kit Kat update. What is so good about this phone is that you can move all the apps to SD card. I have installed 32g SD card and I'm very happy with it. Some people use 64g and phone still recognizes the card.
Very nice phone
Very good phone
Waste of money.
so for so good.
very nice phone
working perfect
it freezes alot
Good ítem a++++
Nice cell phone
Excellent look and feel - there may be some confusion with the update - it was all in Chinese! lol but I just chose the first option on each and voila! the phone is awesome my teen loves it and the size is so impressive. The White has the feel and sleekness of a new luxury car - seriously the phone is pretty. The functions are awesome and the speaker is actually loud! The phone is quite intuitive and very easy to use right out of the box (once you update). My only concern is that the battery is built in - that makes me a little nervous but for the price I think it is well worth it!
Had this phone since March 2015, and so glad I bought it. It is a great phone and pretty durable until here recently, when I stepped on it and the screen went to crap. Works just as fast as my wife's Samsung galaxy s4, if not better. Takes pretty good pictures for an 8 mp camera (though the camera app doesn't quite work). Overall, for $150 this phone was a great investment, especially since I use Straight talk phone service and can't really afford the $400+ brand name smartphones. I would definitely recommend  this brand to people, and will certainly buy Blu for my next phone!!
This phone has a great screen and is pretty fast but there are a few reasons why I am returning it today.<br/>1. Battery life sucks<br/>2. speaker phone is so low it's barely audible<br/>3. headphones and jack only worked for listenign to music, it does not work for phone calls<br/>4. Can hardly hear anything when making calls, either through speaker phone or regular on ear<br/>usage.<br/>The good thing is that Amazon is letting me exchange it for another model so hurray for Amazon<br/>Over all I do not recommend this phone based on my own personal experience
S***ty phone I got this for my mom and phone mic stop working.
wow nice phone
Very good cel.
Very satisfied
Awesome phone!
Great phone!!!
Love my phone.
happy with it.
Love the phone
I LOVE IT!!!!!
Garbage, phone will not turn on after a couple of months.
Little bulky and English translations not always accurate
Gave 5 stars.
Awesome phone
Great phone!!
Great Product
Love my phone
Very good (y)
great phone!!
Love, love it, so perfect....just can't find case I like
I bought this phone for Christmas Last Year. As I opened the package I realize it had a little water damage at the top of the screen. That wasn't a problem because it was a Amazon Warehouse Deal and the disclaimer said it would have minor artifacts. However, after using the phone for a few months it worked perfectly; then out of no where the screen developed lines that cover almost half of the display. Its a good phone, but I would caution users, if possible get another brand.
Do NOT Buy! I had this one day.  It turned on the first day then I let it charge and the next day it was a black sceen with some script message and it kept beeping. I should have listened to the other negative reviews.  I think the 2014 and the 2015 model are different because it appears it's the 2015 Model that comes loaded with lolipop 5.0 that do not work. Amazon should really take these off and stop people from buying this mess only to return it. Do not recommend.
GOOD PRODUCT
Working well
Great phone!
I love it!!!
Great phone.
Nice phablet
cool love it
Outstanding!
Great phone!
Excellent...
I bought the item especially using for navigation, but somehow the phone did not have GPS feature.. Very important feature that such a phone should have. Seller should emphisize that GPS feature is missing in the phone.
This phone is just JUNK! Waste of money. Tried to run a few games. Phone starts to lag<br/>and then ends up freezing. Keep on needing to reset the phone. Really annoying.<br/><br/>Cool Look. Modern Style.. But JUNK!
this i bout as a gift for my mom and she like amen
will not attempt to buy any of these phone again
Love this phone...couldn't ask for a better one.

Great phone
this device was great... good speed, clear image.. the only problem was.. EVERYBODY who called me had a horrible echo (eg the caller would hear what they said repeated back to them with a 1 second delay).  Didn't matter if I was using speakerphone or not.  Didn't seem to matter how person was calling me as both cell and  land lines had duplicate issues.  As the primary purpose was to make calls.. well.. what's the point?
Very disappointed in this phone. I couldn't even make a call without the phone shutting down and rebooting. Even just laying on the table it would shut down and come back on. Maybe I just got a lemon but I returned the phone and did not want another one after all the trouble I had with it. The phone was also bigger and bulkier than what it appears to be in the picture. I could not recommend this phone to anyone.
Broke when i dropped it not even a big crack.
Bought this as a replacement phone. Had some problems at first, now running lollipop software. Installed a 64gb card, and have over 20 movies on my cell, thanks mainly to an android app.  Still have over 35gb on memory card. Most of my music library is not on my cell, because of ITunes was my usual choice. Will now buy through Google play, I can transfer it to my ITunes w/ no problem. Great phone
This is a cute phone, and I was excited to get it.  However, the sound was not good.  The incoming calls were far away, and it was hard for others to hear me.  I tried using the headphones but still the same thing.  Also, even with the volume turned all the way up, the problem remained.  I really hated to return the phone but I was getting frustrated having to yell and constantly repeat myself :(
My hubby loves it!! It's big and beautiful!
Was very upset with it especially after paying so much! You can hardly hear it! It has such a tiny speaker on a poorly located place! My husband has a smaller Blu phone and his has amazing sound. Wish I could return it because I am not at all happy with it. Love everything else about it except maybe the side buttons but if you can't hear your music or phone calls what good is the phone.
I love it.
Low volume

Nice phone
Every good
This phone is great. Especially for the price you can't beat it. I would purchase this phone again if for some reason mine broke. Although, the speakers are not that loud there okay. I had to buy a SIM adapter because i have a micro SIM. The phone is pretty big, but cool. Compared to the galaxy though its not as good of quality, but like i said for the price this is a great phone.
I love it......I even upgraded to the 7.0
Ordered this for my husband and he loves it. I have the galaxy note 3 and to be honest I like his better. It's bigger and has all the same features. The only thing to be concerned about is the camera, as is with every phone. Be sure you know what kind of camera qualify you're looking for. This one is just okay not over the top. I'd still recommend to all.
Im trying to figure out whats goin on with my phone....i have had it only a few months and one day the mic just stops working. People can call me and I can hear them...but they can not hear me...Do anyone know what could have caused this? or how can it be fixed? Or is it better just to trade it out at this point...thanks for any feedback/help with this

Nobody should ever waste there money.I bought this phone 3 weeks now and I am now experiencing major problems such as, needs a battery replacment (battery won't charge), phone screen gwan blank and charging port defective...wen buying this phone it says new and in two weeks wen it cannot be return am facing all these issues... Smh never again
This phone is exactly what it says it is. It had all the bells and whistles. It is great when watching Netflix. Although I really wish it had soakers in the front or a higher volume setting. The only problem I have had is if I send a really long text the keyboard lags a little toward the end. But overall the best phone I have ever owned.
A really nice phone at a great price. Snappy speed, I popped in a 64gb sd card even though it said only 32gb max and it works fine. All 64gb accessible. I have not used it for games as I am not a gamer but it plays 1080p movies just fine. Big bright screen, so bright in fact that I use it on the minimum brightness most of the time.
excellent product , I recommend it .
It keep freezing what can I do????
it is amazing phone I recommend it
i hate the fact that the phone have a problem from the box, the screen turns black and u cant do anything, it should be called the black screen of death, it turns black and u cand do anything unless u keep holding the power button to restart, the thing is i cant return it coz its the only phone i have now

I really love this phone the reason y I purchase this phone is because I hade many different phones before but none is as durable as this phone<br/>this is the third one I give away the first two phones about a year now and they still going strong so I had no choice but to buy another
Can not work, Can Not power on!
I'll never use Chinese product.
Bought Two phones for both of my kidsThey Love them .The phone show very nice pictures and movies show very well . Everyone wanted to know were did I bye the phone. Very nice Size as well delivery was Great 2 days and they were here. Package was on point Love I would Bye another!!!
Well I needed a ln update and this phone is good for what I need it for. So I really can't complain to much. However I did get my phone the day after I was supposed to. Which isn't no big deal. Just thought I should put that little bit of information up here. Thanks for reading.
I got this for my wife and she LOVES it - the 6" screen is large but not "huge" - it's definitely still a phone instead of a tablet, but with great visibility.  It functions well in every way and is of surprising quality.  I'll be buying a 5.5 myself before not long.
I'm redoing my whole review to give this phone it's fair slice.<br/><br/>First and most important, the GPS on this device is inadequate for navigation, this loses a star for ANY Android phone. I drive 18 wheeler and ended up buying a Galaxy S5 which I have been using as my primary phone for the last month, but am still using this phone for internet surfing and several apps.<br/><br/>This phone didn't launch Grand Theft Auto Vice City which was a disappointment for me, but I found a way to get the game to launch simply by having my facebook messenger chat icons always on top. When the icon was on top of the game, the game always loaded, and played well too. It did actually run most apps smoothly tho, so I can't complain much (and I have plenty of apps).<br/><br/>Other than that, the photos are comparable to my S5 without a noticeable difference in quality. The camera is simply awesome on this phone. Everything on this phone is top notch, and should please any user. It was definitely a better value than the S5, as my S5 only has it beat in ruggedness, water resistance, GPS accuracy, and the ability to play my game. I paid $250 more (nearly the price of this phone) for it tho.<br/><br/>LAST and still of great importance, when it came time to replace my charge cable, I realized that the industry standard for micro USB devices has too short of a male end. The female receptacle on this phone is deeper than most, and you need to find a compatible male charger. Look for ones that have depth and you will be fine.  This made me want to rate the Phone 3 stars, but my ability to solve problems is high enough to accept this minor set back. It might be too much for others to accept tho, so I leave it up to you.
Love it, best phone under 200
This phone is great but I don't really like the screen sensitivity because it's not like most phones I had that you can use your finger tips and operate the phone. This one seem more of taking the inside of your thumb operating it but if you mess around with the settings enough you could adjust that but Other then that the phone is great and have good picture quality. It also work with a straight talk micro sim.
This was the worst purchase made....The phone started to malfunction within 1 month of using it.  The key pad sticks, the phone takes for ever to load.  Persons who are interested in purchasing this phone should purchase at their own risk....Very unsatisfied customer
Thanks!

I ordered this phone two weeks ago and let me say what a waste of money. My phone doesn't even work any more the screen won't turn on and it freezes up a lot. I got a refund and I ordered the blu studio 5.5s and it's way better than this piece of crap
Love it! Very easy to use.
Sound sound volume sound speaker ear piece all the way around this phone does not get loud enough I think anyone would agree!!!!!!!<br/>THIS IS A AWESOME PHONE!!!!!!!  (BUT) WHERE'S THE VOLUME????????  FIX AND THIS PHONE ROCKS 100%!!!!!!!!
Great phone for the money works great on ATT and Metro pcs it gets 4G not LTE you will have to update the phone the battery comes completely dead must have a sd card due to the low internal storage been using for a week no problems at all
My battery doesn't charge
awesome phone I  love it.
Thanks
Super!
Luv it
Thanks
I purchased this phone for myseIf i am very satisfied with the phone all the features the look I'm impress especially with the price but their is one concern I have the volume is way  to low , other than that thanks blue.
This blue 6.0 cell phone works great and thank you so much for the great price as well.<br/>8 look forward to see if just maybe you come up with something else I may need buddy again thank you so much. 100% thumbs up.
i purchased this phone 4 months ago and it just stop charging suddenly no warning no nothing
I like everything about the phone except that I can't get the text/calling to work. I transferred my straight talk Sims card. I read that straight talk works in it. Will give 5 stars if I can get this to work!
Overall a great phone for a great price. It actually work fine with all the apps I use. I'm almost all day long using my phone because of my work and studies, so a good phone is necessary for me. No regrets!!
likes this phone alot.
I am Just in love with this phone....I have no problems with this device..... I had a 5.0ii and compaired to this beauty it's nothing Lol....I Just love blu phones now....no more Samsung or HTC ....
The BLU Studio 6.0 smartphone came completely battery dead: not that I expect a full charge, but enough juice to turn on the phone & run through set up while doing the initial set up and initial charging would be great! Otherwise the phone has been great so far: easy to set up (latest Android OS), easy to use, really like it so far, other than the dead battery on arrival issue. The BLU has a nice large screen: this is really just a more budget friendly version of other available Smartphones (Droids & iPhones) - if you want Android, this is a good option, but it does seem like a cheaper knock-off of a Samsung Galaxy 5, pretty obvious there: not bad though, and would (so far) recommend! Will check back with an update when I've used this a bit longer if my review changes :).
great

do not buy it.. its misleading  comes as a refurbished phone mine came with screen protector on finger prints all over it and scratches it and some kind of sticky stuff on on it.  W.T.F
Beautiful phone!  The only issues I have are the microphone doesn't work very well.  The party on the other end of skype can't hear me very well.  And the camera is not good quality.
Reception is bad, and the volume on the speaker is low even though it turned up maximum, hard to hear from caller. I would not recommend this phone. And may have to return this one.
I love this phone when it works,  I've had 2 in 3 months.  Sadly it seems you get what you pay for.  It's taken another dump and I've given up on it.  Too bad.  I did love the phone
Don't recommend.. .
widely recommended.
It was a bad product! Got stuck with no way to restart, until the battery went down (You cannot remove the battery). Then got stuck again after recharging. I returned it!
Not the best phone
This is the most awesome phone in the world my first one came and the screen was messed up. They replaced it immediately. The best investment I ever made. THANK YOU BLU
At first, I thought it was too big, but I've gotten used to it and I can never go back to smaller phone. This phone does everything I need it to do. Highly recommended.
Blu allows advertisements to pop up on the phone at any given time, whether you are on a call or online, they are constantly popping up. It becomes extremely annoying.
only had my blue 42 days the case that I put on it the screen cracked in 3 days after that it stopped charging so I'm stuck with the phone in the case for nothing
excellent product
Absolutely love it. Full big screen not to big not to little. Colors are beautiful.  Big bold phone. You get what you paid for. And its absolutely wonderful
I DID NOT PURCHASE MY PHONE FROM TXGIRL98. I PURCHASED MY BLU STUDIO 6.0 FROM BEST BUY. THE PHONE WORKED REALLY WELL FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. ALTHOUGH THE CAMERA IS NOT WORTH A CRAP, THE PHONE WORKED REALLY WELL. AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS, I NOTICED THE CHARGE KEEP GIVING OUT. I'VE HAD MY PHONE FOR ALMOST A YEAR NOW & THE PHONE WILL NOT CHARGE AT ALL. I'VE BOUGHT DOZEN OF CHARGERS AND NONE WILL WORK. I RECOMMEND NOT PURCHASING A CHEAP CRAPPY PHONE. TAKE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING THAT WILL WORK PROPERLY. DON'T BE CHEAP OR YOU'LL REGRET IT. I'M NOW SEARCHING FOR A NEW PHONE BECAUSE I HAVE HAD IT WITH BLU.
The battery runs out quickly and the screen isnt sensitive.The camera is also bad,front and back.The phone also lags and has a problem turning on and off
Was excited but once I received phone, it has some weird Chinese letters on screen and I cannot do anything. Can't power off or anything. A total waist.
unreal performance for a $ 160.00 cellphone....very nice display, camera has lag, so I would recommend a different camera app from the Google store...

Both phones broke in less than 3 months.  To fit them I would have to pick up yhe costS.  This 2as a total loss to me.  I would not recommend it.
So far so good. I kind of like the options that you can get data on both sim cards.great option and I hope I'm not making a mistake about it.thx
wonderful phone
Nice big screen
I am happy with my phones, a very trustworthy company Amazon, I will always do business with you and send my friends and family. Thank You
These phones were not unlocked. To make matters worse, we took them out of the country and will have to pay extra to have them unlocked.
I would probably love the phone if it supported USB OTG (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_On-The-Go).  I own another phone from BLU, the 'BLU Advance 4.0', real cheap entry level phone, that supports the mode mentioned above. I attempted to ask about the  OTG support on this forum (questions section), but got no response. So, now I can answer the question ( NO, it does not !), but unfortunately, I have to send the device back, since no OTG is a show-stopper for me. Sorry BLU, I'll just have to search for another one.
Qveral good phone. Little bit slow, but for this money this is not very important. Screen real good. My wife so happy with this phone.
It broke on me
Camera could be better for such a big phone but over all not bad phone cool features just needs lil updating on resolution and etc..
Is excellent!
It works fine for me. Freezes up every now and then. I ordered the white phone but was sent the black. That's why I rated 3
I have had this phone for lest then a month and,when i call out no one can hear me, Is anyone else having this problem???
EXCELLENT EQUIPMENT IS VERY VERSATILE IN THESE DAY WAS DELIVERED BY LIBERTYEXPRESS WITH THREE MONTHS LATE TO VENEZUELA
Great phone very good value,  They could improve documentation for the phone with bigger print make it easy to read.
Great phone!
I am enjoying my smartphone.  when I ordered it I thought it was a little smaller, but I am getting used to it.
I love this phone but I am having trouble finding the exact case I want. But the phone itself works great.
Other than my speaker and microphone not working after only 3 months, this is a great phone for the price!
The best phone I out there. A real steal. Unbelievable. Not your average smart phone. Fast delivery too!
Well worth the price you pay for,wont get any better pretty much and does everything you need it to do
Great phone!!! Fast and capable for the incredible price!!!! Blu products are better than i spected!!
I cant wait for this to come in the mail tomorrow i have the 5.5 already just wanted something bigger
It's not as I expect it to work, but its working..... The Quality of the screen saver its not 100% !
After 3 days , its a great phone with a few misunderstanding problems but um getting the hang of it
Didn't work on the system I needed. Dcma instead of gsm. Sorry don't know enough to rate product.
Works fine
Works well

Volume is very low ; phone crash after 3 weeks using it: its the worst android I have ever used
I'm really satisfied with this phone. Good sound. Display is very clear. Pictures looks great.

The BLU Studio 6.0 HD has excellent resolution but the battery drains too fast, even when not in use.  Also, the earpiece volume is horrible.  None of the reviews I read spoke of these issues.  Knowing what I know now, I would not have purchased this phone.  If I could send this phone back I would.
This is a fantastic solid phone. Good design and functions. I'm interested in it.
love it!! great phone for a great price.. Fast shipping and I will order again!!

do not buy at first it was good but then the screen started to have a display problem where it would have a lot of lines so i tryed to turn it off and when it was powering on i could see the app it was on so from my experience do not buy not worth the money i will go with a samsung
i am having all kinds of problems with the wifi it wont work most of the time
Not a bad phone so far for the price.  Using on Straight talk and works fine.
I love my new phone I had an iPhone and will stick with this from now on
:)
Delivered as stated in good condition and works perfectly fine to date.
I love this phone many people have asked where I got it and I told them
I love the phone.. I recommended other friends to purchase the phone..
THIS PHONE FREAKING SUCKS.... I GOT IT IN MAY AND IT BROKE IN JULY SO LIKE 2 MONTHS? IT WAS $150 TO FIX . THE LCD BREAKS VERY FAST. AFTER I FIXED IT A FEWS DAYS LATER THE SOUND STOPPED WORKING AND NOW THE PHONE BROKE AGAIN. THE LCD IS FREAKING TERRIBLE
I have owned 7 other smart phones. This is the very best of them all.

this product. is excelent. i recived . I'm very happy. thenkyou.
The one I got a couple days ago had a serious quality issue.  The screen was blacked out after downloading all the suggested updates, and that was it.  I will return it and never buy a cell phone from a minor supplier like BLU.
it is very low it is turn all the way up , not all but this is
I am have lots of problem with this phone, only had it a week.
I got my phone on Friday. Everything works great!! Love it!!!
My brother just Love this phone it is the right size for him.
Battery doesn't last and phones hesitate to respond to touch.
Great phone! Would give a 5 but the speaker is substandard.
This phone looks good, but the product's performance sucks!
This was a Christmas present to my Grandson.  He loves it!
Is a new experience, I'm learning more of it, I like it.
Great
My family is loving it. Will recommend my friends
The phone is good even this time but after 3 months it broke mouth piece and wherever I take it for repaire they say those phones don't have parts. It's still in the box.
Amazing phone!!!! Will definitely purchase again
Love this phone can't wait to get it in my hand

This phone is a piece of s*** I received it by July 7th 2015 and its not working anymore,I will advice no one to buy it cuz its fake.
Bought it for my wife.  she loves it
Amazing fantastic phone for a price.
Good fone but not many features,,,,,
More than I expected, great bargain.
To be completely honest, the one I bought at Walmart was more equip, this phone is giving me technical problems already.
Phone did not work, waste my money.
My sister give this as the present.
For this value, it is the greatest.
Love the phone it satisfy my needs.
Good . Thanks . 100 % recomendado.
The phones appearance look great!
I ordered my phone from Amazon and it came fast . my phone wouldn't read my SD card from my galaxy s3. I purchased a new SD card and and it work ,I also ordered a tpu case from amazon and decorated it see photo. The phone is a good phone the only reason I gave it four stars is the speaker volume and when you talk on the phone is not loud enough so I use my blue tooth or the ear plugs that come with the phone. Also for anyone who has a problem keeping the USB cord connected to the phone just cut a little around the case so the it cord can  fit closer for connection. I also purchased straight talk Sim card kit it comes with att and t mobile Sim cards. I used the att Sim card regular size not the mini and place in the first slot and I called straight talk and ported my number from virgin mobile to straight talk and my phone stays on 4G no problems love it. I ordered this phone for the bigger screen size and paid $137.00 for it. I read all the reviews on amazon and u tube. I didn't want to Pay a mortgage note for a bigger Galaxy phone. I paid less for this phone than my galaxy s3. I am satisfied with my purchase.<br/>Update since my phone has had recent system update my pictures messaging does not receive nor send pictures anymore will be contacting blue products.com. to see how they intend to resolve the issue.
I am just loving my phone. It was delivered on time. The phone exceeds my expectations. I am very satisfied.
Too sensitive, always rebooting
Good product in terms of price.
I love it. Its works excellent.
The phone is real bad to be sale online. The battery don't come off and it keep rebooting every hour.
Fantastic phone for the price.
Should have removable battery.
As expected good and big phone
I love the phone. However, as it is laying down (with any phone, really) it is just too hard for the touch screen to register tapping. The phone is gigantic; bigger than what I expected. A 6 inch display seems so tiny in pictures, but in person...WOW. The colors were amazing and vividly bright, the best screen I've had. However, about a month into using it, my brother put it in his back pocket to carry around, and I guess...Leaned on something, and the screen had a crack in it. (not a visible crack in the glass, just on the screen itself.) It is very fragile and should be treated like glass. That's the only thing I did not like about the phone, everything else (including the 1GB RAM...Which seems low, but it holds out.) is perfect, however the camera quality wasn't that great either.<br/><br/>As a phone, 5 stars.<br/>As a smartphone...4. I love the thing, but I just can't see myself getting another one. A great experience to have the phone, but not a great experience to relive.
Great phone for a great price
PERFECT!!  LOVE this phone!!!
It's okay but a little slow.
Very good phone. However it seems that fue to Its size, it is prompted to lock up and fail
Great phone. Very satisfied
battery wont last 24 hours
Love this phone great gift
Great phone for the price
Great phone for the money
Phone screen cracked on week 2 good software. but cheap stuff was used to make it.
Had the phone 9 months, it crashed. But I loved it. I will get another one.
Junk! Please don't buy.
The wife loves it!!!!!!
The phone stop working
the best for its price
Its can work on AT&T; ?
Works great, excellent
Great phone, I love it
the phone is quiet gud
Yeah I'm looking for a phone right now, I was about to buy this phone immediately because of the looks, the 6.0 HD screen, and the awesome features but after looking over some more info, the battery is not replaceable. Damn! I really wanted it, but I can't trust this phone. No I didn't want the 5.5s or 7, the 6.0 looked to be ideal for me but whatever. Minus 2 stars because the battery.<br/><br/>UPDATE 3/23/15<br/>Um okay, I couldn't resist. I took the risk of purchasing this phone LOL! Maybe It will be reliable...hopefully. If not I'm hopping on that Samsung train, next phone will be the Note 5(unlocked) when its out. I've always wanted a Note. I also bought the 64GB card.<br/><br/>I will update after I've used it for sometime.
Thank you,  I love it
Touchscreen is disappointing. You have to press harder than normal.
So far so so pleases

Camera is horrible.
No complain as yet.
Very bad product..

It's A Good Phone
Best phone I have

l like the phone
A liittle bigger
I bought this for my wife. She never bothers me about anything electronic but as soon as I told her I was getting this device, she drove me nuts until I got it. Well, Finally did and now I want one. Only problem is, I just got the Studio 5.5s a few months ago. I have no complaints about it but, this 6.0hd is beautiful and responsive. The screen is a little brighter than the 5.5s. It feels very comfortable to hold as well. It's perfect if you want a phone but, the feel of a tablet. 6inches is not overwhelming.
I had this phone for about three weeks, got it on a Gold Box deal. The case/wallet I ordered showed up today. As I'm getting ready to put it in the new case it dropped about three feet to the floor, still in the cover that came with the phone. It hit at the left lower corner and shattered the screen. It dropped on a fairly soft linoleum floor with a soft plastic case on the phone. No other phone I have ever owned would have broke that easy. Buyer beware, don't sneeze on this phone, it will break.
It seems great.
Phone shut down
Very nice phone
Don't work well
Love this phone
this phone is TOO HUGE!! It IS a "phablet" i didnt realize how big it was gonna be. I felt ridiculous holding it against my face. I only had it for about a week and to be honest even though the size was my biggest issue it just wasnt all that. it was really just a big A** basic phone. the sound was bad and it didnt have anything extra to make me want to keep it and look past it's size lol. If you're a basketaball player with ginourmous hands though you might like it :D
Phone reboots on its own.Not what I expected.
So far so good
I liked a lot.
It works great
Awesome phone
Phone is okay
Well pleased.
Love my phone
Great phone!!
The camera is very sub par, especially the front camera.<br/>It has almost zero chance of getting lollipop.<br/>The battery life is worse than my 2014 Moto g.<br/>It handled memory well, but randomly froze at times.<br/>The capacitive buttons have poor response and always have a bright light.<br/>The screen is very pixilated at less than 250 ppl.<br/>I returned it for the 2014 Moto g, which is far superior.
The phone is a perfect copy to a Note 3 for half the price and that's all you need to know about this amazing device.
Low quality products and low quality customer service. Lots of issues with the phone, starting from slow screen response to audio-video being out-of sync. Memory issues will prevent you from loading more than just a few apps. The design is very crude and the phone is much bulkier than similar sized phones from other manufacturer. Overall, very disappointed with the purchase and never buying a BLU again.
This has been a jewel. Bought this back in January of this year. This has probably been one of the best purchases for the price I have ever made online. I have had no problems in the almost 6 months I have owned this Android phone. When this things does blow up, I am getting another one. What a diamond in the ruff. Most people that see this phone have never heard of Blu for cellphones only cigarettes.
Great phone.
works great!

Very disappointed in this phone. I love the size of the screen but like other reviewers stated the sound is not the best at all. Six weeks after purchase grey lines appeared across the bottom of the screen. About 3 days later the whole screen is covered in fine grey horizontal lines. Checked with amazon and the time for returns has passed. I would not recommend buying this phone.

The phone came fast, but the phone ringtone volume is VERY POOR!  Even if turned all the way up to the max...still low. Miss all calls incoming because poor ringtone volume.  I can't send in because I've already have phone set up with phone service...very pissed!
This review is for Blu 6.0 HD. I was very impressed with the phone upon opening the package. It did fine for the first month. I ordered it on chance because I figured since the Nokia Lumina sells for less then half the price this one does and it's a pretty decent phone, that this phone should be decent also. However, right after the 30 day return window closed, the phone started shutting down when opening simple apps like Photos or Camera. I was referring this phone to everyone who was discussing getting a new phone, but now I give a strong warning to stay away from this brand altogether. I'm also disappointed that I'm stuck with a phone that shuts down multiple times a day and I threw away almost $200.00 on it. I don't plan on buying another phone from Amazon.
Purfect!
exelente
Love it,
This phones arrived as scheduled but with a bad screen, and viewing on screen is obscure by this defect. I am very disappointed with this purchase especially since I bought it as a gift for someone. Why sell stuff that is defective for that kind of money.
Have had this phone for a week, and though I really loved it at first I have to return it. Pictures in my gallery were not keeping, they kept being "unreadable" and deleating. Going to try one more of these phones and hope for the best...
I absolutely love this phone!! Its all I hoped it would be and more! Only flowers I ha enjoy found yet is I have to use earbuds with mic for calls because voice is low. But this devise is quite a excellent bargain for the money!
love it

Got this phone a while back. But it was a good phone. The only thing is that I dropped it and it didn't turn back on from there so I had to get a new one. But I really like it because it was a big phone.
Great phone, especially for the price, would have given it a 5 but I cracked the screen and part  of the screen quit being touch sensitive. Couldn't enter my password to unlock screen. Bought new phone.
i like blu phone , but it look like i just these are no good, i buy as new phone a unlock phone that what it say on the add , the one i get the screen was  crack , the 2nd was lock & was not a new phone, got  #3 it was not new but it works so i did not care ,at this time hook up my Bluetooth & i was good to go, a few weeks later i for get to charge my bluetooth  so i have to hook it up the old way the non bluetooth way come to fine out that part dont work i have to twisted  hold it at the rite part to talk so other people can hear me,  i hate this phone
Great!
Great.
This phone is HORRIBLE. it's called STUDIO but the speaker sucks, the sound sucks, even plugging in a headset sounds terrible.  missed the return window just barely. dont buy this phone
it is quite quick color is good biggest complaint is in audio during conversations. speaker to small? not loud enough even on speaker other than that for the price C+
Terrible the battery is swelling up in the phone 7 months old and no help from the seller. Lights r exposed on the side because phone has permanent battery. Unhappy
Wouldnt hold a charge. Voice was muffled...disappointed. The Blu 5.5 seems to be way better. Blu needs to re-think this one over.<br/>As for the seller 5 stars.

I am SO MAD this phone will not import my contacts so I did a factory reboot on it and it now will not load any apps or do anything I cannot believe how poor this phone is
Does not work properly, and I don't reccommend it to anyone
Item is exactly what I needed. I'm very happy with it.
i love this phone wished it would have worked for me
I got this phone still and it don't work no more
If you don't know about BLU then your a nobody.
Not good quality . Arrived broken would not even turn on.. Big disappointment ..
I could never make it connect to play store...had to send it back. Therefore it did meet my expectations.<br/>It was a beutifull looking phone
Not bad for the price!
excellent product
Good phone
My main phone is an iPhone, and I must admit: I'm in love with it. And with iOS. But I thought I'd give this Android phone a try. As indicated by my three-star review, it's okay. But there are a number of things that miss the mark, at least for me.<br/><br/>First of all, I have no issues with the display, and--surprisingly--very few complaints about the Android operating system. It was pretty intuitive, though not as intuitive as iOS. Granted, that may be because I'm used to iOS.<br/><br/>Here are some things that I don't like about this phone:<br/><br/>*Personally, I think it's too big. I know that "phablets" are all the rage now, but I don't think I could ever get used to carrying and using a phone this big. I find it very awkward to hold it in my hand and talk on it. I do have small hands, so maybe that's a factor. I also find the phone quite heavy.<br/><br/>*Quality of the calls on this phone are not as good as on my iPhone. The audio is just not as clear/sharp.<br/><br/>*The screen itself--the actual glass--is not as resistant to fingerprints and smudges as my iPhone screen. I find myself having to clean the glass on this phone constantly.<br/><br/>*The case provided with this phone is pretty cheap. Fortunately there are some third-party cases available.<br/><br/>*The few times I've tried to take video with this phone, the quality has been poor. Simple video of my cat playing in the living room was choppy. I'm using a quality micro SD card, so I'm confused as to what the problem is. (On the other hand, the still camera works very well.)<br/><br/>*Playing videos from YouTube and other websites seems to be a challenge for this phone. The actual video seems to play alright, but the audio is, in many instances, terrible. Full of distortion and static. It's frustrating, to say the least.<br/><br/>That's a quick summary of some of the negatives I've experienced with the Blu Studio 6.0 HD. As with all electronics these days, your mileage may vary. That said, I'm a firm believer in "you get what you pay for." I just don't believe that a top-notch, 6-inch, unlocked smartphone can be had for $129.99 to $149.99. But maybe that's just me being skeptical.<br/><br/>I've decided to keep using an iPhone for my wireless service. I am now using the Blu phone as a mini-tablet. Took out the sim card and it works great as something between an iPod Touch and an iPad Mini. So all is not lost!
Good buy
Does everything I need it to do no problems so far.
Not worth  buying

All good
