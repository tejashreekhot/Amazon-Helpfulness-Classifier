SHORT VERSION:<br/>----------------------------<br/>You may not be able to know for sure if you will get the XT1103 (model 00630NARTL) or the XT1100 (model SM4034AW4N3) when you purchase this phone on Amazon.  I bought one for myself (sold directly from Amazon) and then bought one for my wife about a month later (sold from DeltaMobiles via Amazon).  I got the XT1103 US model on the first order (from Amazon), then got the XT1100 international/euro model on the second order (from DeltaMobiles). This is a problem because the XT1100 cannot use 3G or LTE on my carrier (Consumer Cellular, which piggybacks on the AT&T; network) or on virtually any other US cellular carrier. So even though I went back into my Amazon order history and purchased the second Nexus 6 using the same product page as the first that I bought, the second was a different model that will not be able to utilize high-speed data.  See the photo attached to this review which shows both boxes side-by-side. I am returning the XT1100 and I bought my wife another Nexus 6 directly from the Google Store to be sure I will get an XT1103 that is set up for US data networks (it was the same price as Amazon when I bought it just now).  I use Amazon all the time for all kinds of things, but in this case I would recommend that you avoid purchasing a Nexus 6 through Amazon unless it is clear exactly which model you're going to receive.  You are SUPPOSED to get an XT1103 when you buy the phone on this product page - note that in the Technical Details section on the product page it specifically has "00630NARTL" as the item model number, which is the US-compatible XT1103, so if you get an XT1100 (model SM4034AW4N3) you are getting the wrong phone.  I am suspicious that DeltaMobiles is purposely sending people the wrong phone.<br/><br/>LONG VERSION:<br/>----------------------------<br/>I love this phone.  This is my first Android phone after three iPhones and I couldn't be happier.  I love the huge, bright screen, the camera is pretty nice, the phone is fast, and LTE is awesome.<br/><br/>But here's why I wrote this review: I purchased my Nexus 6 on May 7th, 2015. It shipped from Amazon (in other words it says "Ships from and sold by Amazon.com" under the price on the Amazon product page), and I got the XT1103, which is the US model. It only took a few minutes to set it up on my service (Consumer Cellular, which piggybacks on the AT&T; network), and it hooked up to LTE immediately.  You probably already know this if you are shopping for a high-end smartphone, but LTE (aka 4G LTE) is the most recent high-speed data network.  It means faster downloading, web browsing, etc. and is one of the major benefits of upgrading to a new phone if your current phone is not LTE-capable.<br/><br/>My wife was jealous of my new, giant, beautiful phone, which is understandable since I intentionally showed it off to her all the time and often suggested the inferiority of her old iPhone (which was a hand-me-down from when I made my previous iPhone upgrade). So for our anniversary, I bought her a Nexus 6 as well (purchased on June 16th, 2015 - a little over a month from when I bought mine).  I gave it to her today, and then started setting it up for her.  Everything in the setup went normally just like it had with my phone, but when I disabled the wi-fi to test the data network, I noticed that her phone was not connecting to LTE (or 3G for that matter).  I set both our phones side by side and checked the APN settings and some other phone settings to verify that they were set up identically, which they were.  I had only taken the phone itself out of the box up to this point, and when I removed the rest of the contents I saw the European plug on the phone's charger.  I compared the box of her phone to mine (see attached photo) and finally realized by looking at the labels that my wife's Nexus 6 was the XT1100 (euro/international model), and that I had gotten the XT1103 (the US version).  While the XT1100 looks identical, has an identical OS, uses the same nano sim card, etc., it has a very different setup in terms of compatible cellular networks and will not use US 3G or LTE. Note that the XT1100 will still work for making calls and using basic cellular data (GSM), but you will not be able to access 3G or LTE.<br/><br/>I was pretty certain that I had bought my wife's Nexus 6 from the exact same product page on Amazon from which I had purchased my own, so I went back into my order history to verify this.  Both of the orders do point to the same product page, but the first order (XT1103 US model) was sold by Amazon, while the second order (XT1100 international model) was shipped/sold by DeltaMobiles. Currently (June 20th), the product page says it is being sold/shipped by Amazon again.  I didn't even realize that it was a different seller when I made the second purchase.<br/><br/>This situation is pretty frustrating because nobody buying this phone to use it in the US would likely choose the international model instead of the US model since the international model will not perform as well on US networks, so I don't know why they are sending the XT1100 to US customers.  Because the seller (DeltaMobiles) covered the SM4034AW4N3 model number on the box with a separate tag (see the photo attached to this review) I became a little suspicious that they are intentionally sending people the wrong phone because many people may not know that the XM1100 is the wrong phone.  After all, it is a genuine Nexus 6, it will place phone calls in the US, and it will be able to use cellular data, so many people may start using it and never realize (or only realize too late) that they've gotten the wrong phone that can't use the much faster 3G and 4G data networks.  If it is possible for a seller to make a little more money by sending the XT1100 to customers in the US than by sending them the correct XM1103, I bet this would explain why DeltaMobiles is sending out the wrong phone.<br/><br/>For your reference, these are the compatible networks for the two versions of the phone:<br/><br/>XT1103 (Model 00630NARTL) :<br/>GSM: 850/900/1800/1900 MHz<br/>CDMA band class: 0/1/10<br/>WCDMA bands: 1/2/4/5/8<br/>LTE bands: 2/3/4/5/7/12/13/17/25/26/29/41<br/>CA DL bands: B2-B13, B2-B17, B2-29, B4-B5, B4-B13, B4-B17, B4-B29<br/><br/>XT1100 (Model SM4034AW4N3)<br/>GSM: 850/900/1800/1900 MHz<br/>WCDMA bands: 1/2/4/5/6/8/9/19<br/>LTE bands: 1/3/5/7/8/9/19/20/28/41<br/>CA DL bands: B3-B5, B3-B8<br/><br/>And if you put the search term "List of LTE networks" into Google, you can go to a Wikipedia page that will show you all of the individual networks and what bands they use for LTE.
I won't do a full review, as many other reviewers and review sites have already covered this phone in detail, but I did want to touch upon some specific areas that I had questions on when I was a new buyer.<br/><br/>Size<br/>This phone is almost as big as the proverbial elephant in the show floor. This doesn't detract one bit from the phone. I was coming from a 4.1 inch screen, one where I could comfortably get my hands around the screen and phone body (I have small hands), and was pretty petrified of moving to a 5.96 inch screen. But after a few months of owning one, I've gotta tell ya, I don't notice the size one bit. The phone still fits comfortably in a jeans pocket, isn't awkward to use, and I even find myself being immersed in the screen to the point where everything else melts away. More than once I look over to someone next to me to see an iPhone 6+ (which is smaller) and think 'Golly, that's a big phone!' Then I look back to what I'm holding and smugly smirk. The phone's size allows for so much more productivity without being an awkward behemoth.<br/><br/>Battery Life<br/>The phone comes with a 3,220mAh battery, and, simply put, this lasts all day for me, and I often come home with 60% left in it. This is over two long commutes sitting on the phone with the screen on for hours. It's great. I've also had it last a full weekend without recharging.<br/><br/>Android<br/>One of the main appeals of a Nexus phone is getting fast updates with no bloatware installed. Google has done good by me so far. Android Lollipop is a vast improvement over 4.X.<br/><br/>Carriers<br/>I'm using this phone on Verizon with no problems at all. Just be sure to go to an official Verizon store and they'll give you a nano SIM for free (franchised stores will not). Since this is an unlocked phone, you can also use it on any of the other U.S. carriers. Choice is great!
Smashed the screen on my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 in a freak accident so decided to "upgrade" to the Nexus 6. I'm not brand loyal but never have and never will buy anything made by the company (cult, if we're going to be honest) with the largest market cap, sales, profits, and assets among the world's biggest tech companies: crApple. This is my first non-Samsung cell since a 2-yr stint with the HTC G1 prototype, and so far this Nexus has treated me well. Here are some things I noticed:<br/><br/>Sound quality: audiobooks and my calls sound very noticeably clearer than on the Note 3 (using the same headset). This isn't solely my subjective opinion, as I was also told that it sounds better (like "being in the same room") by someone I speak with frequently. N6 wins.<br/><br/>Interface: no S Pen stylus... which isn't bothering me yet. I prefer to take notes using my voice with "OK google", but this isn't practical for all situations.<br/><br/>Tactile: N6 touchscreen seems slightly more responsive than the Samsung, but that's probably just because the zippier processing power leads to quicker reactions from the apps. I do miss that button at the bottom of the Note 3, oddly enough.<br/><br/>Body: I liked the feel of the faux leather back on the Note 3, but the body of the Nexus 6 has a nice contour and fits in my hand well. If you have dainty hands it may seem a bit cumbersome, but it's perfect for me and I already like it better than the Note 3, which was elegant but could be oddly difficult to get a solid grip on sometimes. The Nexus 6 is heavier than the Note 3, but I don't see why that would be a disadvantage unless you have extremely weak arms. Some people won't like that it isn't flat (it doesn't sit still when you place it on a flat surface), so it's a tradeoff: would you rather have comfort while holding your device, or a phone that will lay flat on the table? My test for a phone being too big is this: does it fit in your pocket? It fits in mine, so this Nexus passes my litmus test for what constitutes a phone.<br/><br/>Battery life: this of course is what some people care about most. I honestly don't notice much of a difference between this and the Note 3... which may be a bad thing for Motorola since this is supposed to be a "next gen" cell that is competing with Note 4. If you are a heavy data user then you could end up dissatisfied with the battery life of the N6. Still, there are some who will complain about battery life no matter what... EDIT 9/7/15: I've had the phone for over 6 months and haven't ever run out of juice. That said, I usually remember to recharge once a day because I'm not the type of person who is comfortable driving with a nearly empty gas tank.<br/><br/>Speed: it is noticeably faster than the Note 3, as one would expect. If you are accustomed to using fast desktops, then you won't be disappointed with the N6.<br/><br/>Tech support: I unintentionally unchecked the MTP (Media Transfer Protocol) tick box on a USB connections submenu and then couldn't for the life of me figure out how to get back to the submenu to re-tick the box (this became a problem since it caused my desktops to not recognize the phone when plugged in via USB). So I called google, and after waiting only ~4 minutes (I was given the option to receive a callback, but I preferred to stay on the line) I spoke with someone who walked me thru the process for finding that particular submenu once it "disappears." Problem solved, and now I know my way around the OS a little better. I'm pleased to report that the google tech support experience was quite painless.<br/><br/>Durability [3Nov2015, I'm adding this note now that it's been over 8 months]: I have not had any problems with the durability of my unit. I drop the phone occasionally (granted, it always has its bumper on). Usually by this point I've mangled the headphone jack socket from overuse on my phones, but this hasn't happened with the Nexus 6 yet (could be because I use Bluetooth much more than in the past). Anyway, be skeptical of the negative reviews posted on this site; check a reviewer's link to get a feel for how reliable they are... for example, the latest review, "Terrible quality, plastic is chipping off and fallig all over my house" is the only review posted by that user.<br/><br/>And really, the best part about owning a Nexus 6 is that the replicants (androids) in one of the best science fiction films of the 20th century (<br/>) are of the "Nexus 6" generation.
I’ve owned my Nexus 6 for a week now so here are my initial impressions.<br/>First, if you will be using your Nexus 6 in the USA, be sure your model is the XT1103.  That is the version that Google, Motorola, Amazon (directly), and all the wireless carriers sell.  Some of the Amazon Marketplace resellers are selling the international version which doesn’t support some of the LTE frequency bands used in the USA.  (you would get slower data speeds on your expensive phone.)<br/>The Nexus 6 is a huge phone and my first “phablet”.  Before owning it, I thought it would be too big, especially when coming from a puny 4.7” Nexus 4.  But I can say I’ve adjusted nicely to it and have had no real issues holding or using it, even with one hand.  I am very careful with it however, and I put it in a case right away.<br/><br/>What’s Good:<br/>- The Size.  Its great reading articles and watching videos on this huge screen!<br/>- The Picture.  The display is rich with deep blacks and vibrant colors.  When I look at my old phone, the color is very muted.<br/>- Android Lollipop 5.1 – This is the very latest version of Android and with the Nexus 6 you will get it first.  There are some very useful new features with this release, and 5.1 fixes lots of bugs that hampered the Nexus 6 before.<br/>- Fast.  The phone is very fast and doing whatever you need it to do.<br/>- Quick charger does charge the phone very fast.  It may not be good for the long term life of the battery, but it sure is handy.  At night, I use an old slow charger.<br/><br/>What’s Not as Good:<br/>- The Size.  If you have small hands, forget about one handed use.  Also it may not fully fit in your pants pockets.<br/>- Average battery life for me.  But I have every feature turned on and use the phone throughout the day.  YMMV<br/>- Screen in direct sunlight.  When walking outside or when mounted on my dash, when direct sunlight hits it, I can’t see the screen very well, even at max brightness.<br/>- Slow camera.  It takes it a bit to load.  And especially in low lighting, it takes a bit more for the camera to focus.<br/>- Some minor Lollipop bugs and annoyances persist.  But that is to be expected when you are the first to get the latest version of Android.  You will also be the first to get the fixes.<br/>- Expensive.  The retail price for this thing is way too much.  Fortunately I’ve seen Amazon (proper) drop the price periodically, so if you haven’t purchased it yet, you may see the price fluctuate to your advantage.<br/><br/>Features to try out:<br/>- Ambient Display – Whenever you get a text or notification, it’ll briefly show it on the screen when your phone is locked.  Also if you gently move your phone, it will show the time and any notifications.  Very handy.<br/>- Always on “Ok Google” – The phone will respond to your voice commands even while the screen is off and unplugged.<br/>- Smart Lock – when at home, work, or connected to Bluetooth devices, the screen will not lock.<br/>- Add PC Keyboard – With this huge screen, why not include a dedicated row of numbers on your keyboard?<br/>- Chrome Text scaling to 120% - A bigger screen should show larger text, not more tiny text.<br/>- Turn Animation Scale to .5x – This is a Developer option.  Changing Window, Transition, and Animator Duration scales to .5x will make your phone appear more zippy.<br/><br/>In summary, I really like the larger screen and added features of the Nexus 6 compared with my old Nexus 4.  If you’re coming from a Nexus 5 or any flagship phone from 2014, the upgrade may not be as beneficial however.  Keep an eye out for discounts and deals once the next big wave of 2015 phones gets in full swing.  The Nexus 6 will be a workhorse for a long while, and will always have latest version of Android before any non Nexus phone, so that helps keep it relevant too.
*** Preface ***<br/><br/>For the past 6+ months I've been doing everything I can to save some money on my cell service, while still wanting to keep a smartphone. Coming from the Nexus 5, I loved that I could bring my phone to almost any carrier and not worry that I would have to deal with trading in my phone and starting a new contract. The problem, however, is that I couldn't get service with my Nexus 5 on Verizon. They were the only carrier that my phone wouldn't work on. After 6+ months with Cricket and their dreadfully slow data speeds, I had to switch, and the Nexus 6 stood as the best device to help me make that switch!<br/><br/>*** First Impressions ***<br/><br/>Let's start with the basics: The Nexus 6 is a HUGE phone. At more than 6 inches tall, it makes it extremely difficult to reach the notification shade or icons near the top of my screen. To put it simply, you have to use this phone with both hands. On the bright side, the display is absolutely fantastic, and Android 5.0 does an awesome job of making the phone feel responsive and new. Animations fly in and out of the screen with no lag, the color palette that Google brings with their new "Material Design" elements is amazing, and there's nothing like watching HD videos on that size screen.<br/><br/>** Pros: **<br/><br/>> 5.96" "Quad-HD" display looks fantastic<br/>> Quad-core 2.7 GHz processor is both fast and efficient<br/>> Battery life is much-improved compared to last year's Nexus 5<br/>> Snapdragon's new hardware allows Google Now's "Always On" voice detection<br/>> 13MP camera includes dual-LED flash and 4k video recording<br/>> The included Turbo Charger refuels the battery in record time<br/>> Curved back is excellent for holding the device during use<br/>> Dual front-facing speakers provide some LOUD music and notifications (you will NOT sleep through your alarm!)<br/><br/>** Cons: **<br/><br/>> The display can have a pink-ish hue when set to very low brightness<br/>> Battery life is still not quite up to its closest competitor (Samsung's Galaxy Note 4)<br/>> 4k video recordings blur easily<br/>> Android 5.0 doesn't do much to take advantage of the 6-inch "phablet" experience<br/>> The curved back makes it extremely difficult to type when it's resting face-up on a desk.<br/><br/>*** Ergonomics - How do you even hold a phone this big? ***<br/><br/>The Nexus 6 was designed very well. Like, incredibly well. When I bought the Nexus 6, my wife bought an iPhone 6 Plus. At first glance, the Nexus 6 looks a LOT bigger. In fact, they're very close in size, but the thinness of the i6+ gives it a much more management appearance. The noticeable difference in feel is what puts the Nexus 6 ahead. While it's definitely heavier and bulkier than the i6+, that bulk lets you get a much better grip on the device and the dimple on the back acts as a reference for where to keep your index finger. If held properly, the Nexus 6 allows a clear view of the entire screen and a full assurance that you won't likely drop the phone. Alternatively, the i6+'s thin, metallic frame means that it's got a very slick back surface, and the smaller width keeps two-handed operations from being all that comfortable. In fact, my wife disliked both the feel of the device so much that she brought it back to Verizon and traded it for a Droid Turbo.<br/><br/>On the subject of design, there is one thing that is absolutely frustrating. The curved back makes the Nexus 6 the equivalent of a playground teeter-totter when resting on a desk. Unless you prop something under it before use, it's nearly impossible to type anything while it rests on a flat surface.<br/><br/>The usb port is in the center on the bottom, standard positioning for most Android devices these days; while the audio jack is in the center on the top. One nice feature I've noticed a number of people mention so far is that the front speakers stick out just a tad, which means that resting your phone face-down won't put the screen directly on the surface. I don't know how much I trust this, since there's less than a millimeter of separation there, but with a screen protector it's definitely a safe bet that your screen will be properly protected.<br/><br/>*** Extra Features: ***<br/><br/>As I mentioned before, the Snapdragon 805 and Google Now work together to allow users to trigger the "OK Google" voice command even with the phone in your pocket or resting on your desk. With previous iterations, this was only possible when the phone was charging or when the screen was on. From my experiences, this voice detection doesn't affect battery usage, which is awesome. This is an excellent feature for those times when you don't want to get up just to set a reminder for something later in the evening, or when you're busy with something and decide you want to listen to some music while you work.<br/><br/>On the subject of music, the front facing speakers are amazing. With the Nexus 5, I was stuck ALWAYS having to use headphones or my bluetooth speaker if I wanted to listen to music. The Nexus 6 has enough volume and clarity to where you really don't feel the need to keep your headphones close by unless you're an audiophile.<br/><br/>Speaking of audiophiles, the Nexus 6 comes with 6 months of Google Play Music All Access for free. Since it's free, I've been using it exclusively since I got the Nexus 6, just to get the full experience. Having any artist at my fingertips is pretty awesome, and the radio feature is REALLY cool, but I'm still not sure if I'm sold enough on it to pay for it at the end of 6 months. Either way, it's a great inclusion on Google's part.<br/><br/>*** Technical Stuff: ***<br/><br/>Now down to the nitty-gritty, for those who are into that kind of stuff!<br/><br/>This phone features an AMOLED display with 493 ppi. With AMOLED, the blacks are exceptionally black, because the backlight is only activated for the pixels that display color. This gives the screen an awesome level of contrast. If you're coming from an IPS display (like the Nexus 5), try turning them both on at the same time in a dark room. The Nexus 5's display will have a lot of light leakage from around the edges and the Google logo may seem a bit blurry, compared to the perfect darkness of the Nexus 6 display and very crisp image of the Google logo.<br/><br/>The phone's 3 GB of RAM is more than enough. I've had a LOT of apps running at the same time, and still notice more than 1 GB of free RAM. In a word, you'll never run out. This makes the device feel like it's completely future-proof. The Nexus 5 would always be within 500-700 MB of its 2 GB max, which felt like I had to be very careful about my usage.<br/><br/>The Nexus 6, like most Motorola devices, has an amazing radio. Through numerous speedtests on Verizon's network, I was able to get better downlink/uplink speeds than my computer on Wireless-N to my home router. I absolutely not how quickly it connects to the network, and it never drops below 2 bars of LTE, even in my work building where I was lucky to get 1 bar of H+ on the Nexus 5. Granted, Verizon gets a head-nod for this as well, but considering how it stands up to my office-neighbor's iPhone, the Nexus 6 is definitely at near the top of the connectivity ladder. Bluetooth and WiFi are also flawless, and the Nexus 6 is fully compatible with WiFi 802.11ac.<br/><br/>Battery life, like I said before, is very solid. If it weren't for the Galaxy Note 4, I would probably say this is the best smartphone in terms of battery. Then again, the Droid Turbo is probably going to knock the Nexus 6 down a peg once it gets updated to Android 5.0, with its much larger battery (the DT has 680 mAh more and a significantly smaller screen).<br/><br/>For those who love to modify their phones and try new things, the Nexus 6 (no matter where you bought it) does have an unlocked bootloader. There's already a pretty awesome community on XDA that's building all sorts of great features for the Nexus 6. Unlocking the bootloader does include one more step than it did on the Nexus 5, but it's extremely easy (just an option that has to be enabled under developer options before you can use the fastboot command).<br/><br/>*** tl;dr (I don't blame you): ***<br/><br/>In short, the Nexus 6 has every feature you could want in an Android device. The big screen is beautiful, and it's followed up by a solid battery to give you all of the fun you could want. If that's not enough, the included Turbo Charger will fill your battery in no time, and the phone is fast enough to handle any Android game on the Play Store. If you're into snapping great pictures, the 13MP camera takes awesome shots and includes Google's HDR+ mode as well as 4k recording (if you're careful). While the price is much higher than recent Nexus devices, Google's done a great job of not really providing any glaring inconsistencies like users were used to with the older Nexii.<br/><br/>One issue that many people may not be able to overcome is the size. I highly recommend heading into a store and playing with the phone for 5-10 minutes just to see how manageable the size is.<br/><br/>Rating:<br/><br/>I gave this device 4 out of 5 stars. If the battery were better than the Galaxy Note 4, or if the color didn't tint pink when the brightness goes low, then this would probably get rounded up to a 5.<br/><br/>If you've got any questions, feel free to reply!
A co-worker just picked up the Nexus 6 and we ran it through it's paces to see if it was a quality device.<br/><br/>It definitely is. It's a MASSIVE quality upgrade from last year's Nexus 5 phone (not made by Motorola)<br/><br/>There are some top notch features and a couple draw backs that should be considered before buying this phone.<br/><br/>░░░░░THE UPSIDES░░░░░<br/><br/>❖ The processor. The Qualcomm Snapdragon processor does not mess around. This phone ends up being buttery smooth with its animations and scrolling. You do not feel like you are on a road full of speed bumps when scrolling through a long list.<br/><br/>❖ The Camera. It's a good 13MP camera. I took a few decent pictures of my office with it and the reproduction and image quality was strong. Since most of us use a cell phone camera as a "Oh I'm so glad I have this camera with me to capture this unexpected moment" device rather than a "I think I'll open a professional photography studio and use my phone as my primary camera" device....the camera on the Nexus 6 is perfect. There are better cameras on phones, but do you really need a better one to grab those 'phone camera' moments?<br/><br/>❖ Battery Life. The battery life is solid on this phone out of the box, promising a full days battery life for normal use so you don't have to charge up at lunch time. It delivers as advertised, but the phone is capable of a lot more. Rooting this phone is relatively simple, and within 30 minutes I had my coworker's phone rooted and made a few modifications to Google Services elements that I find are a giant waste of system resources without paying dividends to the user for the battery they consume. We made those modifications to his device 6 days ago and he's charged his phone 1 time since. Any Android phone can get better battery life than it does out of the box, but the Nexus 6 started with strong battery life so improvements just made it insanely good.<br/><br/>❖ The screen. Motorola delivered on this one. Holy cow. Generally speaking I hate the on screen nav bar at the bottom and prefer capacitive buttons on the screen's bezel. (Like the Samsung Galaxy S line of phones). I am typically turned off when the nav bar is the only option as I find it to be a waste of screen space that could be otherwise better allocated. That is true on a normal sized screen. But this nearly 6 inch screen extends the length of the screen so that the nav bar is using up screen space that doesn't exist on other phones. And since it can be hidden for various uses (video, camera, any app that wants to auto hide it....etc) you are left with a HUGE screen that doesn't add a ton of girth to the actual phone itself. And the quality of the screen is outstanding. The resolution is higher than your HDTV, on a smaller screen. So the clarity is insane.  And the AMOLED panel gives you brilliant images with true to life color depth.<br/><br/>❖ Android Lollipop pure version. Lollipop takes some getting used to for a long time Android user. There are some pretty significant changes to the OS over Android 4 and below. But it's still easily recognizable as Android. And most of the changes are for the better. (Not all. I'm looking at you, GMail) And since this is a Nexus phone you are getting a true Android OS, not a heavily modified version that has a phone manufacturer's resource intensive UI crammed into it. The result is a more battery friendly, easier to use, better organized, smoother running OS that will impress the heck out of you.<br/><br/>░░░░░THE NEUTRAL░░░░░<br/><br/>❖ The front facing speakers do produce decent quality sound. They aren't top of the line JBL floor speakers, but you shouldn't expect that. They do great for watching a video or playing a song occasionally, but you can't open a dance club with this phone as your sound system. This is a neutral rating because you're not supposed to be using your phone for super high fidelity sound. Get a nice headset for that. The speakers are great for a video now and then. And being front facing is a nice touch so the sound is directed properly. That means you can actually keep the volume lower and hear it just as well without annoying everyone around you.<br/><br/>░░░░░THE DOWNSIDES░░░░░<br/><br/>❖ The price. Don't get me wrong. Its' actually a decent price to a phone with the specs this one has. In fact, it's a solid rival to the Galaxy S6 which has a much higher price tag. It's just a little disappointing that it's in the Nexus line of phones, as the Nexus line was supposed to be the affordable high mid level phone option for Android. Don't get me wrong. You are getting good value with these specs at this price, but you're also left without a cheaper Nexus option. Somehow I think that once you hold this phone in your hand though that you won't care anymore. You'll just think it's awesome.<br/><br/>❖ The battery is not removable or easily replaceable. A cell phone battery has a life of about 500 charge cycles. I tend to keep my phones for 2 years as daily users, then I keep my old phones for a variety of other purposes around the house. (My old HTC Sensation from 2011 is hooked up to my stereo for use as a nice wifi streaming media player with a touchscreen UI, for example) I eventually have a need to replace batteries because I wear them out. I like being able to go on Amazon, spend $20 on a replacement battery, pop it in and be done. Additionally, even if you don't keep your phones that long, batteries fail sometimes. On the Nexus 6 I'm sure it would be covered by warranty for at least a year but it'd be a pain to take it somewhere to have it worked on should the issue come up. So no replaceable battery is big deal for me. This might not be an issue for you. If not, great! But be aware of the issue before making purchase decisions.<br/><br/>❖ You can't expand the storage with an SD Card. I don't want to live in the cloud. I hate the cloud. Sometimes I'm not on an LTE network. Sometimes I'm in the middle of nowhere but still want to show someone pictures of my kids. The version my friend has is a 64GB model. That is large enough for most users, but something about not being about to remove the storage and expand if I felt like it just doesn't sit right with me. I also like to be able to pull my SD card out of my phone, toss it in my computer, and transfer the files. I root and backup my phones too so I often have 4-5 GB back up files that I want to store elsewhere in case I screw something up. It's just faster than transferring them via wifi and I don't have to deal with plugging in the data cable. I just like removable storage. Again, you might not care. If not, great!<br/><br/>░░░░░THE BOTTOM LINE░░░░░<br/><br/>❖ Buy it. I'm a little annoyed that my Galaxy S4 is still running well, preventing me from justifying the purchase of a new phone. If my S4 suddenly feel into the garbage disposal tonight...with the water running....the Motorola Nexus 6 would easily be my replacement phone. Even with the non replaceable battery and non expandable storage. I don't like those elements, but the rest of the phone is so good I could overlook them.<br/><br/>That's what this comes down to. If those aren't a big deal, buy it and you will be SUPER happy. If those are a big deal, you will not be happy.<br/><br/>If you completely take the battery and SD out of the equation it's not a contest. The Nexus 6 is a GREAT phone. Consider those downsides BEFORE you go to a store to look at the Nexus 6, otherwise you'll just fall in love with it and stop thinking objectively. (Hey, it's a pretty phone. I can't blame you)
I received an invite to Project Fi. In order to participate, you need a nexus 6. What a great way to be on the ground floor for a great wireless service AND a good excuse to get a new phone.<br/><br/>And what a phone it is.<br/><br/>It is a big phone without being cumbersome or awkward. It really fits nicely in my hand - and I am coming from a Moto E, so this is a bit of a change. The curved back might give it a teeter-totter aspect, but it settles nicely. I really like the little dimple on the back...it gives a nice reference point for your finger when you are holding the phone.<br/><br/>The power and volume buttons are well set and easily accessible. The usb port is on the bottom, the mic jack on the top.<br/><br/> The display is very, very sharp and clean. And big. So big. It makes everything look different - Netflix is very cool on a Nexus 6. Even everyday apps - gmail, my calendar, Keep, and other daily tools look so much nice on this big, crisp display. The screen clocks in at 1440x2560 (493 ppi) - this is a lot more than what I've been used to. You never think a sharp display is a big deal until you start using a phone with one.<br/><br/>The processor is plenty strong to handle the apps and the Lollipop OS. The GPU and CPU has more kick than the first desktop computers I've owned. Several of them, actually. It certainly has plowed through a stack of apps - from facebook to several google docs and sheets open simultaneously. And it looks great doing all this. My phone spent some time upgrading to the latest flavor of lollipop 5.1 - and the os is really starting to come into taking advantage of the larger screen.<br/><br/>I decided to save some dollars and go with the 32BG model. You can double the size for another 50 or 60 bucks, but I have cloud storage options from google, microsoft, and amazon. I got my phone from Motorola, so it is 'pure' android - no bloatware, no carrier or manufacturer 'vanity' apps. Tally up the amount of space chewed up by bloatware and it's pretty significant - this phone comes light. I've added a number of apps and still have more room than I can imagine needing. The new google photos app even manages and pushes photos to the cloud, so I expect not to see a lot of pictures lingering in the phone.<br/><br/>Speaking of pictures - wow. Mind you, I am coming from a moto e - itself a very nice phone for the price. But this phone packs a 13MP back facing camera with a twin led flash. It's got some other features that make it a great improvement over what I am used to - and a solid camera however you look it at. I had a lot of fun playing with the photo sphere feature - it was very cool and stitched together some nice pictures.  The front facing camera pulls about 2 mp and is certainly good for the facetime or hangouts.<br/><br/>The battery life is solid. The included quick charger kicks in when the phone is running low. Charging is easy and quick. So far, the life of the phone has been excellent. It works well with qi chargers - I just ordered a cradle so it will be a great nightstand clock. It has NFC which includes 'tap to pay'....something I am going to start playing with soon.<br/><br/>The wifi is what you expect for a $600 phone - 802.11a/b/g/n/ac 2x2 (MIMO). Suffice it to say that it has done a great job picking up signals everywhere I've gone. Lollipop does it job on the software side and all is good in the neighborhood. This is key for a google project fi customer - the service seamlessly transitions from wifi to it's partner 4glte networks (Sprint and TMobile). This works great, by the way. A good wifi connection is key - and this phone provides.  It also has the ability to communicate with a ridiculous number of international carriers - again, the Fi plan takes advantage of the hardware and will provide me with cellular service in pretty much any country I am likely going to visit.<br/><br/>Oh, the speakers. I use Bluetooth headphones a lot - because speakers generally suck on my phones. Not this one. The forward-facing speakers are awesome. I'll still keep my headphones on hand, but the speakers are pretty sweet. On the topic of audio - the built in mics are very sensitive and work great with the google now functions built into the OS. There is the standard 3.5 jack - frankly, I haven't used it yet. But I am sure that it is like the rest of the phone.<br/><br/>Solid.<br/><br/>Google got into making hardware to provide a platform for their content. The thing I like about them is that they don't compromise doing it. This is a great phone for the price.
I bought this for $349 but was also wanting to see what the new Nexii can offer.<br/>So far, I say there's no reason to get the latest Nexii (5X nice size but not as powerful, 6P great but costly).<br/>I am very pleased with this phone and what it offers. This is a great traveling phone as it supports world bands.<br/><br/>Here are my takes.<br/>Pros:<br/>1. Day 1 UPDATES!! Already on Marshmallow 6.0.<br/>2. Excellent speakers, DUAL FRONT FACING!!!<br/>3. AMOLED Display means black pixels is completely off thus saving battery.<br/>4. PRICE: $349 for a flagship phone!!<br/><br/>Mutual: 6" Display is both a pro and a con. Great to use but also too big to handle one-handed.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1. Nothing, maybe the sheer size of the device but it's roughly the size of Note 5 / iPhone 6S Plus anyway. Small phone users will take some times to get used to this but will eventually love it.
This phone is a total disappointment. Bought this from TMobile less than a month ago, and I'll now be returning it for an exchange. The first issue that I encountered was that it was shutting down on its own, when being carried in my pocket. After searching around, I found that the possible root cause was the settings option to wake up the phone when shaken. I turned that "feature" off, and haven't had that issue since then.<br/><br/>The second, and more dangerous issue is the expanding battery (possibly) that is ripping apart the sealed back cover. Really, Google/ Motorola, you call this your "flagship" phone? Look at the pictures I've attached - what a rip-off - absolutely bad build quality. It's not just me - just search for 'Nexus 6 Back Cover' and you'll see that this is quite a commonly occurring problem. I really hope that the replacement I'll receive would not have this issue!
This is googles best phone as of today. Go directly to the manufacturer either to the google website or the motorola website for the $650 either midnight blue or white version. This is over priced. I have used this phone as my daily driver since it came out and it is beast! Almost 0 lag on this device. Yes theres a little hicup here and there but when I mean "here and there" thats almost never. This phone is just awsome. Yes its a bigger version to the moto g but who cares. Customers are asking for a bigger screen (thats just the same with the iphone 6 and 6+) and with loud front facing speaker this is an awsome phone. Battery is ok not the best but itll last you through the day just fine as it has lasted me. And I use my phone more then the regular user. Bottom line is if you want to go for the greatest and latest android experience buy this phone, BUT buy it from the Google or Motorola website because $650 is the base price for this phone not $950.
The Nexus 6 is the new successor to Google's  very own Nexus 5 from last year. This phone aims to be bigger and better than the already awesome Nexus 5. This time Motorola has decided to give it a shot to make this pure android experience so let's see if this year they nailed Google's new flagship phone.<br/>________<br/><br/>Design: The Nexus 6 is BIG. When I say big, I mean really big. The only phone that comes close to being the size of this phone is the iphone 6 plus. This phone is almost the borderline of what determines the difference between a phone and a tablet. Motorola is really stretching the size with this phone. The phone is a lot more rounded and curvaceous from last years model but I feel like it was made this way to make gripping such a big phone a lot easier. I do like the design of the device especially the metal bezels which give it a premium feel. The keys are not mushy and give a good tactile feedback.<br/>________<br/><br/>Sound: The phone utilizes stereo front facing speakers which make a bigger sound than phones with bottom or back speakers. It is very reminiscent to HTC's boom sound speakers. Overall the sound is better than the average cell phone but still has a long way to go in terms of sound.<br/>________<br/><br/>Display: The Quad HD AMOLED display is brilliant and crisp. I love the color reproduction, the blacks are nice and overall it is a very good screen. It is an eye candy to look at along with the material design of the new Lollipop UI.<br/>________<br/><br/>Processing Power: Android Lollipop is smooth and flows really well with this phone. With my old nexus sometimes there are hickups with Lollipop but that's not the problem here. Games run smoothly with awesome frame rates. There isn't much to say except that it is one of the best performing phones of 2014.<br/>________<br/><br/>Battery: Despite such a large battery on this phone battery life is average and not the best on the phone. I'm figuring that the Quad HD screen and the Processor does take a huge portion of the battery. Overall depending on how much I used it, it ranged from 6-10 hours but then again I am a heavy user.<br/>________<br/><br/>Camera: The camera is a lot better than last years Nexus 5 though I thought the Nexus 5 had a decent camera. This phone can also shoot in 4K if you are into that. However, the camera isn't mind blowing in any way. It is good but if you are looking for a great cell phone camera, you are better off with the Note 4 or Iphone 6 Plus.<br/>________<br/><br/>Conclusion: The Nexus 6 is a great upgrade to the Nexus 5. Motorola did an amazing job at making the next generation of pure google android phones. If you are looking for a stock android phone with an amazing processing power(and your hands can actually handle this phone), than the Nexus 6 might be for you.
Amazing phone. Screen is so good, battery life is all day and more. I was a little worried about how big it was, but honestly you get used to it really quick and can't imagine using a small phone. Love this phone, but just wait a bit and don't overpay these sellers on Amazon.  Wait until Amazon actually carries it and you won't be disappointed!
Awesome phone love it. The size was never the problem it was the $700 plus price. But since it was only $350 I jumped on it super fast..  I got so use to this 6inch phone that it makes my nexus 5 look like a baby screen... Anyways just buy it and you will be hooked :)<br/>(here is a pic with my nexus 5 & 6)
If you have an unlocked Nexus 6 and are on AT&T; ...and probably any other carrier, don't attempt to install any available OTA updates while the sim card is inserted. If you do, your *unlocked* Nexus will be branded to AT&T...or; probably whatever carrier you have...and you will no longer receive Google updates, but rather carrier updates. This means when Google releases updates for Nexus devices, your Nexus 6 will not receive them. You will have to wait for AT&T...or; your specific carrier...to release the update for your Nexus 6.<br/><br/>There have been reports in some forums that being branded to AT&T; interferes with the Project Fi service from Google. If so, this causeas me to think this is a way for AT&T; to fight against Project Fi...by secretly making Nexus 6 phones becomes tied to its network. I can tell you that my Nexus 6 received the LMY48W build number, which is AT&T; firmware. Any Nexus 6 with that build number will never receive Android updates directly from Google. All future updates will come from AT&T.;
Excellent phone.  Does not come with the mountain of bloat every Samsung phone has.  I use Verizon - I had no problem getting the phone activated.  You must go to an actual Verizon store - not a kiosk, authorized dealer, or Hauzau Shabdabbadab on the corner of 7th and R in SE DC.  Hauzau will not be able to activate this phone on the Verizon network.  You can find the actual Verizon store by looking for the location on the Verizon Wireless web site. The reason you need to go to the corporate store is they can reach into the bag of tricks behind the counter and pull out a Nano Sim Card - which it needs (free), and they can also manually add your phone (new Sim installed) to the Verizon network.  If they tell you they can't then leave.  That person has obviously been infected with a mind phage which has destroyed his honesty, motivation, and initiative gene.<br/><br/>I did not have to root this phone to enable wifi hotspot.  If you use Google apps - (mail, cloud drive, calendar etc.) this phone is for you.  The battery lasts for a while, the screen looks nice, it has buttons that do stuff, and if you yell at it Google will ask you what you just said.  My Cat found the Nexus 6 phone to be an excellent item to sleep on.  I'm not too sure why though - it seems like it would be somewhat uncomfortable, however I guess I cannot speak for my cat - who doesn't really care what I think.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the Nexus 6 phone - it has other things that are like little pictures on the screen.  If you touch them you may win some candy.  If you do not win candy you may be asked to input some form of information.  There are other things you can do with this phone - like listen to music, watch TV on it...Seriously...Who watches a movie on their phone?  Like who does that?  It will kill the battery in about 40 min - and the display is so small it is impossible to see what is going on.  I guess people do it.  There are other things and stuff you can do as well but meh...you'll figure it out.
I haven't been a big fan of Motorola since their Droid X2 many, many moons ago. In performance, hardware and android build quality I have found Samsung's Galaxy offerings to be in every way superior. The Nexus 6, however, represents Moto's 180* turn, and is the phone that is likely to be on my hip for quite some time. There are many reviews here and elsewhere online touting the specs and technical details of the Nexus 6, so I won't get into any of that for the moment, instead deferring to others who've gone to great lengths to explain the value of the 5.9" AMOLED display or Snapdragon quad-core 2.7 processor.<br/><br/>Instead I will offer the review that the average, smartphone savvy user needs - one that just tells you how well it works. Because let's be honest, impressive hardware and specs don't mean much if the device "just doesn't work all that well".<br/><br/>If you've used the Galaxy S4 or S5, the HTC One M7 or M8 or the LG G you are likely familiar with the small lags, or delays, that take place at various points. The little 1 or 2 second freezes in between switching apps or navigating the app drawer? Those never-ending, soul crushing 1 or 2 seconds where you are left staring at your screen thinking "Go. Go. Go! GO!!". Those delays that would be absolutely unnoticeable in any other area of our lives, but which in the use of our smartphones are infuriating. Those lags don't exist with the Nexus 6. Same apps installed, same settings, ZERO lagging. Whether that can be attributed to the hardware, the android build being stock google without carrier or manufacturer flavoring like Motorola's usual "Blur" or Samsung's TouchWiz I don't know, but it just works.<br/><br/>I usually prefer a phone with a removable battery. I tend to use my phone a lot and can go through a 3,000 mah battery in 5 or 6 hours. With the 5.9 AMOLED display on the Nexus 6 I expected even less. Once again, I was pleasantly surprised. The battery holds up remarkably well, and I generally get as much time on each full charge as I did with the Galaxy 5.<br/><br/>One of the other selling points here is that as a Nexus device you are guaranteed to always get the Android system updates you want. If you've had a phone on Verizon or AT&T; you know even after Google releases a new major version change it might be a year before you see that update hit your phone because your carrier has to tweak it to fit their own flavor. With a Nexus device you're getting guaranteed updates almost immediately. For those who don't know how valuable that is, do a quick google search for Android K vs Android L. It's a BIG thing.<br/><br/>The Nexus 6 is easily the best smartphone I have ever used, and I am a man who changes phones perhaps as much as he does socks. Well, not really, but you get the point. I have been through the Droid X, X2, Incredible, Droid 4, Razr, Razr Maxx, Galaxy Nexus, S4, S5, HTC One, One M8, LG G3.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most impressive thing I can tell you is that I am also using the Galaxy S6 - My company line was due for an upgrade and I picked the S6, so my two daily drivers at the moment are the Nexus 6 and Galaxy S6, probably used about equally, and the Nexus 6 outshines the newer S6 all day. The S6 is a truly great phone, it just doesn't line up to the Nexus. (Note that I am referring to the standard galaxy S6, not the Edge) If you happen to be in one of the carrier stores where demo versions of these two phones are available I'd strongly suggest you spend a few moments on each and compare notes. If you end up with the Nexus 6, you won't be disappointed.
Just came on here to say that we got my wife's new Nexus 6 (Cloud White 64 GB from Amazon) activated on Verizon with no problems. She needed a new nano SIM card. We went to the Verizon store (an actual Verizon store, not just an authorized dealer)  and the service tech said it may or may not let him add the phone to the network and if not he would have given us the SIM card and we'd have had to call the Customer Care Tech Support number. But it let him add it and got it activated, and he assured us that my wife's unlimited data plan would not change.<br/>We are currently transferring the media over from the old phone via WIFI (Verizon Cloud app).<br/>She likes the larger screen and the colors don't appear so bad as some reviews say.
To say I love this phone is an understatement. I'm a tech-aholic. I have always bought what's coolest, fastest, and on and on. Also, because of my creative background, I have been an Apple user since I bought my first Mac in 1992. I ditched my iphone about 4 years ago after seeing how flexible, fast and powerful the android operating system was. The only thing that annoyed me was all the crap software that AT&T; and companies like Samsung add over the top of an already functional Android operating system. Well, buying a straight Google phone is the way to go. Before I get into this phone's features, the biggest one, for me, is what it DOESN'T have...all the junk bloatware from AT&T; and Samsung!<br/><br/>PERFORMANCE: I can't say enough about how fast and responsive this phone is. Going from a Samsung Galaxy device to the Nexus 6, I feel like I just upgraded to 5 series BMW after driving what I thought was a luxury vehicle. It's fast but efficient. The combination of not having all those battery sucking AT&T; and Samsung apps, and the 3250 MaH battery (which is big) combines to give this phone great "battery mileage." I'm on my phone all day and it rarely needs a charge until I go to bed around 10:30 or 11 pm. That's surprising considering the 6 inch screen. Also, it appears to be engineered really well as there are small things that are done right. The speaker(s). When you turn on Songza or any other streaming music app, the sound coming out of the phone, itself, is really good and fairly loud. This surprised me too. Oh, I almost forgot this. It charges insanely fast too. I can go from 5% battery capacity to a full charge in under 90 minutes!<br/><br/>BUILD & AESTHETICS: This phone is SO solid. You really won't understand until you hold one in your hand and feel it. It almost feels like a solid piece of metal and the curved back make this large phone feel smaller.<br/><br/>CAMERA: This was my one hesitation before I pulled the trigger on this phone and I'm glad I bought it. There is so much press out there bagging on the Nexus 6's camera. It's stupid. This camera is LEGIT. Now that I have said that, you need to know that I have professional photography experience. My wife has a Galaxy S6 and while the megapixel rating of the Nexus 6 camera may be lower, I don't think I will miss it. Because the sensor is quality making the images quality. You see, larger images aren't always better. There comes a point where it's overkill and those extra pixels aren't doing anything for you. All you need to know is that the camera on this phone is spectacular. It focuses quickly, and, even more importantly, is phenomenal at "metering" (adjusting the lighting) based on what you're shooting.<br/><br/>OVERALL: (Incase you're wondering, no, this is not a paid review. I bought this phone like everyone else.) Again, I love this phone. It's stupid-fast, the camera and battery are awesome, it's ridiculously well built and I'll never have to be concerned about what garbage my carrier put on my phone from the factory. :)
I've owned a lot of smartphones over the years, from iPhone, windows & android phones...this Nexus 6 is by far the best phone I've ever used! Stock android is so beautiful & easy to navigate! The screen is big & coming from a Samsung Galaxy S5, I thought might be too big...but it's not! It feels perfect in my hands & that curved back makes holding this phone excellent! The software combined with the hardware makes this phone function so smoothly without any glitches & apps just fly open & close fast too! I'm a light to medium user & I'm getting 2 full days (easily) from this battery! Actually, when I went to bed last night, it was the 3rd full day without a charge & phone was still on 24% when I plugged it in! Motorola/Google nailed this phone in my opinion!! Nexus devices are becoming my favorites so much, that I just ditched my Gen 3 iPad for a Nexus 9 tablet by HTC....I do NOT miss Apple products whatsoever!!<br/>P.S. front facing speakers are a must for me now after 5 years of iPads!!!!
Even with the Nexus 6P out this is Still a Great buy. Don't let the size scare you. Initially it takes some adjusting but once you learn to hold it, it starts to feel normal and once you get use to it everything else will feel too small. I've had mind since February and I still love it. I honestly don't have any real complaints either, Build Quality is Top notch, camera is good for most. Performance on 6.0 Marshmallow is buttery smooth and snappy, speakers are boss and the 2k Display is gorgeous. Best part is that its a Nexus which means fast updates, dev previews, unlocked for all carriers, no carrier bloatware no OEM skins, easy to root, and a pure Stock Google Android experience. Even though I will be getting the 6P as I usually get the latest Nexus every February I could gladly use the Nexus 6 for another year until the 2016 Nexus. Just do yourself a favor and buy this Beast.
In case you are wondering.... This phone WILL work with Sprint.  The key is that you need to take it to their CORPORATE store.  The phone will need the ESN added to the database AND they will need to provide you with a SIM Card.
FIRST IMPRESSIONS:<br/>I've been a nexus fan for a few years now because of the stock android experience. I previously had a nexus 4 and after that an iPhone 6 but I missed the versatility of Android so I started looking at a replacement for the iPhone 6. I know the first thought on most of your minds is wow that phone is just too big. Well I can tell you now that its not as bad as you think. Motorola has done some intelligent things with the physical design to make the phone easier to hold such as having a curved back and small lips on the edges for grip. The best thing to do would be to go into a phone store and hold it for yourself but I can tell you that it's a lot more manageable than I previously thought before I owned one. I love it and I'm about to tell you why.<br/><br/>SCREEN :<br/>So obviously the screen is big but how does it look ?Unfortunately this is one area where the phone could use some slight refinement. Now don't get me wrong the screen looks really good it's extremely sharp and the colors really pop. But the display has a slightly warm bias and color accuracy is better on other displays such as the iPhone and the Galaxy Note series and its especially noticeable on plain white backgrounds because they end up being slightly grey or cream colored. Is it a deal breaker ? Absolutely not and I am confident you can get used to it because I did after only a few days. It's important to keep in mind as well that this is all preference some people do prefer warm biased displays which are arguably better for content like games and movies. I would have to say as well that this display is not particularly bright and may be difficult to see outside for most people except on its highest brightness settings. Pixel density is also obviously up to todays standards as this phone has a quad HD screen. Text is as sharp as you'd ever need it to be and I guarantee you aren't seeing any individual pixels on this display unless you smash your face against it. But quad HD has some trade offs too. All those pixels contribute to faster battery drain than phones with 1080p displays and graphics performance would be slightly better if the GPU didn't have to push all those pixels. Overall it is a very nice display but I think it could have gotten by with a 1080p display without most people being any the wiser.<br/><br/>PERFORMANCE:<br/>This phone is simply one of the fastest you can get but with the Snapdragon 805 inside you wouldn't expect anything less. A 2.7 GHz quad core Krait 450 CPU, Adreno 420 GPU and 3gb of LPDDR3 ram are the driving force in this beast. Everything is extremely fast from opening apps to web browsing and its also partly to do with stock android as well. Apps almost always open instantly and menu navigation is very smooth. I do get the occational stutters and glitches while exiting or moving between apps but these cases were few and far between and i mostly attribute that to Android 5 still being somewhat new because this isnt the only Lollipop device that seems to have that problem. Gaming is one area this phone really shines as well giving you very good frame rates across the board. Battery life is good but it could be better. I have no trouble making it through the whole day with the brightness at 60-70% with moderate to heavy use. Usually I end the day close to 50% left so it definitely will get you through a day and maybe a half but phones like the Note 4 and iPhone 6 plus can beat it in this category. The good news is that the charger included with the phone is extremely fast. I have been able to get 40% battery from only 25 minutes of charging so that may help alleviate the good but not great battery endurance. There's no 64 bit architecture here and some phones already have LPDDR4 RAM in them but if you're worried about the longevity of this phone don't be because it has some very future proof specs. And while battery life isn't the best it definitely competes well with other premium phones.<br/><br/>SOFTWARE:<br/>So chances are if the giant screen wasn't your main interest in this phone then stock Android was and for good reason too. Android 5.1 is the current version as of this writing and Google has fixed some of the bugs that plagued 5.0 so stability has improved noticeably. I have to say honestly that Lollipop is by far the fastest mobile OS I have ever used and aesthetically its appealing too. Menu navigation is easier than ever and it just feels more cohesive than other versions of Android. Menus and notifications always come from somewhere now rather than just appearing or disappearing and its especially noticeable with the drop down menu where you access things like setting and WiFi or Bluetooth switches. Also being that this is a nexus device you won't find any bloatware. Nope only some Google apps and other thing necessary to the phones functionality. The only downside to Lollipop is that not all apps are compatible. I had trouble getting many older apps to even open at all but newer apps or apps from bigger budget devs should already be up to date and work just fine. But for some people using old and/or obscure apps, this may be a big problem or even a deal breaker. In conclusion if you want a stock android experience that's always up to date with the latest version and performs very well with the exception of some older or not as popular apps not opening, then this is a great choice.<br/><br/>WHAT ITS BEST AT:<br/>The name of the game here is media consumption. Movies, games, books, YouTube, web browsing and photo viewing all benefit from the extra screen size as well as productivity apps. The slightly warm screen color bias actually really looks great with movies and gaming especially, with colors really looking outstanding. This phone really is great for gaming especially. I never felt like the controls of any game i played were cramped at all like other phones and emulators work great. It makes playing games like Worms 2 Armageddon especially easier to play and see what's going on onscreen due to the characters being so tiny depending on how zoomed in the screen is. Books as you can imagine are a great fit for the screen as its almost the size of a small book. Its one of the only phones I've ever enjoyed reading on due to the size. You can even get away with loading desktop versions of web sites but even mobile sites really benefits from the large display as well. This phone is great for power users as well because its essentially a blank canvas for custom Roms and without much bloatware, performance will stay consistently high for the whole time you'll own the phone. The only downsides for power users would be the lack of expandable storage and user replaceable battery which may be a deal breaker for some.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION:<br/>All in all this phone really is outstanding if a little rough around the edges. Its big but manageable, it has great performance, good battery life, is exceptional for media consumption and while a little less refined than offerings from Apple or Samsung it excells in a way that no other phone has before. Its a pure Android powerhouse that's half tablet and half phone. A media consumption beast. It truly is a jack of all trades and may even be able to replace your need for a tablet. I think I might even say that overall this is my favorite phone I've ever owned. So whether you're craving a stock Android experience, looking for a tablet replacement or just looking for something new or different, the Nexus 6 is a dream for Android purists and media junkies alike.
ATTENTION: From brand new there are about 5 Android updates (or more!!!). My phone frozen on the first one and had to do a safe mode reboot, then, it was fine on all others. Before using the phone, do all the updates! I did the “Bluetooth copy” from another android phone and it was great, all passwords done and some app started to get installed. Now, I don’t recommend installing more apps until all the Android updates are done because every time the system does and optimization of every app and it’s a long process.<br/><br/>• Dislike: No led notification.<br/>* Dislike: curved back. When placed on a flat screen its annoying that the phone moves left of right while touching the screen.<br/>• Dislike: No one hand operation. Explanation: I had an Ascent Mate 2 (6.1 inches) with and EMU that provides an option for one hand operation such as, small left or right unlock screen which is very handy. No small screen option neither for one hand operation. Either way, the Ascent Mate 2 was a little bit bigger so I'm ok operating the phone with one hand.<br/>• Dislike: No themes for different icons with color match background.<br/>• Dislike: Screen/phone gets warm/hot with medium/heave use.<br/><br/>• Like a lot: Great 5.1.1 Android as of today and waiting for 6.0 Marshmallow.<br/>• Like: Great front stereo speakers.<br/>* Like: No start or power off sound (noise)<br/><br/>• This phone is fast with OK google on Google now launcher. While charging it the lock scree will show you an estimate time to 100% charge. Look at the picture.<br/><br/>• I like the “automatic” unlock options such as location (for home use) and Bluetooth for the car and smart watch.<br/><br/>• It’s unconventional that the options screen it available from the lock screen, kind of a motherboard password Update: not anymore after an update that change the scroll for the apps from left to right to up and down plus a search and most common apps used.<br/><br/> I hope battery doesn’t die within a year. At current price of $400 for 64GB its kind of a big deal. Will not get worried about space at all.<br/><br/>• Don’t forget to play the hidden game!
Although I wouldn't buy it here at this price, my review is about the phone and not the price. This phone is the nicest Nexus they've made. It seems like it'd be way too big but it actually is just a smidgen bigger than the Note 4, and equally as tall as the iPhone 6+. It just has less bezel than both. It feels great in the hand with its slightly curved back. The auto stabilizing13mp camera is much improved and takes really great shots. Although the Note 4 has a better camera at 16mp, I just don't like all the software that Samsung adds, plus they tend to hide Google's updates under their software. That's just my opinion though. I had a Note 3 as well and more than half the features were turned off and I had the phone pretty much stock and then I realized I like the phone itself using Google apps as the main experience, not the Samsung software. That's why the Nexus 6 is perfect for me. I am disappointed that Motorola put a 21MP in the Droid Turbo and gave it a huge battery with just as good specs otherwise as this phone, but not give it to the Nexus 6? At least a 16 maybe?? Anyways- the 13mp is still great. I'm not on Verizon so I will never be able to give the Droid Turbo my money. I checked it out at Verizon and it's a fantastic phone. I was struggling but I have way too good of a plan to switch carriers now or ever unless they'd match it. Plus Google and Motorola designed this phone, while Verizon and Motorola designed the Turbo. Anyways I digress. The Nexus 6 is a fantastic phone and totally worth getting, but not at this price since Google Play sells it cheaper and you can get it from a carrier. For me 64GB is the way to go since unlike Apple they don't charge $100 for the next GB upgrade, but half. For most 32GB will probably do.
Just took delivery of the Nexus 6 so these are my impressions after a week of use.  I will update my review should any of my opinions change as I spend more time with the device.  There are a bunch of reviews that talk about the system crashing - but I have not experiences any of these to date (perhaps it is the fact the system has been upgraded to Marshmallow already).  Time will tell on this.<br/><br/>Originally I bought this to replace my Nexus 7 tablet as I had no intentions of using the Nexus 6 as my primary cell phone.  However as soon as I got the Nexus 6 in my hands (literally) I realized the device was so much better than my current cell phone (Moto X 1st generation).  I immediately switched my sim card over to the Nexus 6 (both devices use a nano sim card).  The feel of the device  is really good and as I am already a "two handed-texter" - the ability to text or type with one hand (given the size of the device) - is not important to me.<br/><br/>Being able to drop down to a single device (tablet and cell phone) more than makes up for the requirement to use two hands to effectively text or respond to email.  But for sure, this is not a device for the one-handed cell user.  I looked at all the tablets that are on the market today - and they have all grown in screen size and I wanted to stay with a 7 inch screen.<br/><br/>As an aside...  There were a couple of 7 inch tablets (ASUS and Samsung) I could have bought to replace my Nexus 7 - but they all have bad reviews (performance, crashes, etc) or are so under-configured (memory and/or processing power) that I doubt they will last the next couple of years.  Decided I would rather have a smaller 6 inch screen than a crappy 7 inch tablet.  My Nexus 7 tablet eventually "pooped" out as new larger releases of the operating system were installed on the device.  Given the dramatic price reduction of the Nexus 6 and its compute power and 32gb of storage - the Nexus 6 made more sense to me (remember new operating systems never get smaller)<br/><br/>Good things about the device.....<br/>Already automatically updated to Android 6.0 (Marshmallow). A pleasant surprise<br/>Very good battery life (I am not a heavy video user so check other reviews for this type of use pattern)<br/>Love the quick charge feature - never going to buy a cell phone without this again<br/>Quick transfer of applications etc between devices was done simply by tapping the two devices together<br/>Ability to use phone on Project FI (waiting for my request to be approved). Sick of getting raped by the ATT's of the world.<br/>Still comes with Google 1 year warranty<br/>Love that the speakers are in the front<br/>Clean install of Android - no vendor bloatware<br/><br/>Not so good things about the device.....<br/>Really, really slippery - just had to order a case with non-slip surface<br/>Fits in my pant pockets but would be cautious of putting in my shirt pocket for fear of it falling out<br/>Wouldn't try running with this on my arm - really would look like a dork<br/>Took me a while to realize I needed to move my ear up to the top of the phone to hear the caller<br/>Wish the mic was on the front of the phone<br/><br/>One last thing not so good thing..... I don't like the position of the on/off and volume buttons (middle of phone).  I know they are placed where they are so you can use the buttons using the device in one hand as a phone - but when using the phone as a tablet - it is a little awkward trying to balance the phone e.g. while using the device to "read" with my Kindle application for example.  Keep shutting the phone off when I tap to change pages (as noted above the phone is really slippery).  Hopefully this gets solved with my new non-slip case.<br/><br/>All in all pretty happy with the Nexus 6.  Hopefully Marshmallow has eliminated any of the issues some of the other reviewers have experienced.  As noted I will update my review should I experience any issues.<br/><br/>Update 10/25/2015..  Just installed my non slip case (Cimo Slim Soft Case) and this has solved my hand slipping on the Nexus 6.  Also as the Cimo case has raised soft plastic "buttons" that go over the Nexus 6 power and volume buttons, I have also eliminated turning on the phone by mistake (when hand slips down).  Another good thing about the case is it does not cover the Motorola dimple on the back so your hand can still "find" the "dimple" to properly locate your hand on the device.  Lots of the other cases cover this up.
OK, here is an honest review of the Nexus 6. I had a Note 3 prior and decided to update my phone since AT&T; would not push Lollipop 5.0 to my Note 3. So, I found a Nexus 6 on eBay. I had a 2 week trial period before I could send it back so I committed to try it for 2 weeks under various situations and see what I thought. First, I was very leery of getting the Nexus 6 after reading online that some people were experiencing the device getting very hot, too hot to use. They would complain that the device got very hot while running multiple apps and the same time and while charging. I read some cases where the battery would get so hot the battery expanded and the back cover burst off. Anyways, I figured with a 2 week return policy and no restock fee what the heck I would try it. Here's the skinny. The size was no big deal to me after the Note's 5.7" screen. The device did get a little warm once but I was in a place where there was no A/C and it was very hot/humid and I was using it a lot, but that's the only time. My wife touched the screen and stated that it was no hotter than her Galaxy S5 gets so I thought nothing of it. After charging all night for weeks it is never hot in the morning and other times. I even contacted Nexus 6 rep online and mentioned the heat issue. He said when you make so many of something there is bound to be a few that have issues but that the number was small. Next, the rounded back can be a little awkward when typing on a flat table. I got a wallet case so I'm sure it's better than without one. The battery is great, I use it all day from 5:30am until 11pm and it will be around 30%, much better than the Note 3 and that's weird because I have the same apps running and the batteries are similar in size. Mini USB cables seem to not fit snugly into the charging port. The ambient display is a nice feature (when I pick it up messages/alerts,etc appear in black and white so i don't have to log onto the device). It is sometimes sketchy, it doesn't come on ALL the time but for the most part yes and it's handy. I like that the SIM card is located on the top instead of under the back cover. I do not like that the battery is not removable and that there's no SD card slot for extra storage. I also do not like where the power button and volume buttons are located. Hard to get to and adjust. I like power buttons on top for ease of access, etc. The display in the sun is OK, nothing great unless turned up all the way. The display and processor are a bit better than the Note 3. The low-light camera is nothing to brag about but the normal camera is good. I like that there's no "bloatware" and that it is a stock Android device. And that updates come directly from Google, first before anyone else. I already have Lollipop 5.1.1 while I still couldn't get Lollipop 5.0 from AT&T; on my Note 3. All in all it is a pretty good device. Does it blow the doors off the Note 3? No, but it is a good device. I like it and decided to keep it after the 2 week trial. Samsung devices seem to have so many features that seem useless or many people just don't use so having a slimmed down model is kinda refreshing. I will certainly explore getting another Nexus in the future. No issues with this device has been deal breaker. You should be happy with this device like I have been.
I had been considering the Nexus 6 since the price dropped to $499 but I hadn’t purchased it.  Once the price dropped again I jumped at the deal.  I switch phones quite a bit and currently have an iPhone 6 and an Oneplus One.  I have been slowly moving more towards Android over iOS, but didn’t want to spend another $700-800 on a newer phone. However, there were some things about the Oneplus I wanted to improve upon.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/>The phone is extremely fast and smooth.  Stutters that have plagued other Android phones I’ve used are not present on the Nexus 6.  The camera is also better than on the Oneplus One, but still not as good as the iPhone 6.  The other benefits are straight updates from Google and no carrier bloat (using on AT&T;).  And the screen!  Great looking, big screen.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/>The battery life isn’t great.  It’s acceptable but worse than the Oneplus One.  The size…the big screen is great, but I certainly can’t use the phone with one hand.  I knew that going in so not a huge concern, but it could be for some. And it’s slippery!  I don’t want to add a case since the phone is big enough so I will try some skins on the back.  There is one area where the Oneplus One excels.  Great size that's manageable.<br/><br/>Overall it’s a great phone and well worth it at the reduced price.  Build quality is typical Motorola and excellent.  The iPhone 6 is going to a new home.
I purchased this phone from T-Mobile about 2 weeks ago and I have to say, I LOVE IT!! The picture quality is great, I really like the screen size and the battery life is amazing. I can literally use it from 8am-12am with no need to charge it. Motorola has never disappointed me when it comes to their batteries. I recommend you purchase your cell phone cover on here instead of the store. I purchased mine for $8.
I became tired of being frustrated with the Samsung Note 2 and decided I needed to update. I didn't know much about the Nexus but the quality of the camera and the fact that it was on sale for $0.00 with a plan made it an easy decision to buy. I have had it for about a month now and love it. The only criticism is that it takes forever to boot up. Otherwise it is worth six stars.<br/>It has been two months and alas as in all love affairs there have been some bumps on the way. One feature that drives me nuts is the placement of the on/off button. If you hold the phone in your right hand there is no problem. However, if I hold it in my left hand for texting the middle finger or the index finger inevitably keeps hitting the on/off button.<br/>But as in all relationships one must accept the flaws in the other. Still love the phone.

If you are an Android fan,  you can't pass up the Nexus 6.  I have been using this since Google released it last year (through Google Play), and its the best Nexus yet.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Get the latest and greatest updates from Google rather than waiting months for OEM and carrier to push out new features.<br/>- Fast and fluid, easy to use with Android 5.0 Lollipop<br/>- No bloatware<br/>- It's a phablet.  I rarely have the need to 7" tablets anymore because this is large enough to watch movie,  read books and play games.<br/>- 3220mAh battery.  You wont need to carry those charging cables or portable battery,  this phone will get you through the day with ease.  It usually last about 2 days with normal usage (Varies depending on each usage)<br/>- Like an iPhone, it works on all 4 carriers.<br/>- The LED flashlight ring around the camera look nice and clever design.<br/>-  The curve of the back make it fit comfortably in the hand, and not feel like it will slip<br/>-  One of the best camera for a Nexus device<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- The price is quite higher than previous Nexus device but the price is about par with comparable devices like iphone 6 and galaxy note 4.<br/>- It might be a little large for some people, please go to a local carrier or bestbuy and have some hand-on with the device before purchase.<br/>- Though the camera is alot better than previous Nexus, I feel that it is still behind the iPhone and Note 4 imo.
I have had this phone for about a month now. I absolutely love it. The screen is so large and clear, and the device so capable, that it has actually replaced my home computer for most general internet browsing tasks. I got the 64GB version, and I am very glad that I did; I generally do not tote around too much media, but if I find a good Wifi connection sometimes I do download large amounts of data, or otherwise use the device as temporary storage for large files. Also, the lack of an SD card slot makes the larger storage capacity that much more important to me. I have had many bad experiences with phone microSD cards corrupting and losing data, though, so I actually do not miss it that much. Some suggestions to make your phone ever better:<br/><br/>- get a microUSB -> full size USB adapter, they are available here on Amazon for dirt cheap, and let you plug in devices with full sized USB ports. This means that, among other things, you can plug in regular full size USB drives. I have used this in the past without issue; on this phone, I had to install the Nexus Media Importer app to enable this functionality. Not a big deal.<br/><br/>- generally, I find it easiest to copy files to/from the device by using a combination of the ES File Manager app on the phone to create a FTP file server using the app's Remote Manager function, then on your computer (connected to the same Wifi network) I used lftp on the command line to mirror the entire directory structure of the device's "sdcard" directory, where most all of the user-data and media is contained, right to my PC. This works great in both Linux and on OS X (install it with Homebrew package manager). It works even better if your computer has an Ethernet connection which it can broadcast and share over its own Wifi network; this function is built into OS X under the Share settings. This way, I get transfer speeds comparable with USB 2.0. The advantage to this, especially on the Mac, is that I do not have to deal with the horrible Android Transfer software which is buggy and glitches out and drops connections a lot.<br/><br/>- look into Project Fi for a cell carrier. It seems to be a good deal. I got an invite (non-transferable) but have not switched yet since I don't yet want to give up my Verizon coverage. But this is one of the few devices supported by it, so that can be appealing if you want it.<br/><br/>- it can get Android version 6.0 if you want. Mine came with 5.1 installed out of the box and later on Verizon got the OTA update for 6.0<br/><br/>Beyond all that, I do not think there is too much else that you wouldn't find on a standard Android device. The camera is decent in bright settings, though really bad at night; don't plan on taking landscape shots of the city lights at midnight with this one. Overall, a very capable phone, and while its already a generation old, I don't see why it shouldn't last for a year or two, or more, as is the typical expected lifespan for Android devices.
I got this beautiful phone last week and I have to say, this is by far the best phone I have purchased to date.<br/>I am coming from an Xperia Z1 so this was a big upgrade for me.<br/>I was going to wait for the Nexus 6p but seeing that it has a USB c port was a main turn off for me, and also the fact that Huawei made the new phone which made me question the quality and durability of the new device (I'm not just claiming this, I've had not so good experiences in the past with Huwawei).<br/>So I decided to pull the trigger and I got the 64GB for $399. This is one of the best deals out there for any device, and I could finally say Nexus 6 is the best bang for buck on any current phone on the market (and Nexus phones should stay that way).<br/><br/>Here are the +ves of this device:<br/><br/>+ Beautiful QHD Amoled screen that I believe is better looking than IPS screens, and I can honestly tell the difference between QHD and FHD especially with this screen size. A very important note here is to turn off the adaptive brightness as the screen just simply looks awful with it on, with a noticeable pink hue that ruins everything. Turning the adaptive brightness off should be the first thing you do when you turn on your device.<br/><br/>+Snapdragon 805 with 3GB of RAM is noticeably faster than 800 with 2GB of RAM. I can finally switch easily between tabs without having to worry about the tabs being closed every time I switch. I can't wait to see how this phone performs with Android M update that's coming in  few days.<br/><br/>+Size is perfect for me, at first I was a bit sceptical about one handed use, but the more I use it the more I got adjusted and I really don't think I can go back to using 5 inch phones any more.<br/><br/>+Battery life is decent, it's not mind blowing but a step up from my previous phone the Xperia Z1. I do wish Motorola included a bigger battery since this is quite a big hefty phone, but overall I am satisfied with what I have.<br/><br/>+The speakers on this thing is the best I've seen on any portable device. It's not just the volume but the quality of sound, these are some seriously good speakers that will definately meet your demand for multimedia, gaming and entertainment.<br/><br/>+64GB emmc I believe is enough to use the phone for the next 2 to 3 years. I'm really not a big fan of micro SD since they are slower than internal memory, and you can't install some apps on your micro SD (something I struggled with my Xperia Z1 that only had 16GB internal storage). I honestly think all devices should head in this direction, and ditch micro SD since we have cloud storage now.<br/><br/>+The craftsmanship of this device is supreme, this does not feel like something you would get for less than $800. It feels very well made and premium, not too many people care about this particular aspect in phones (that's why so many people buy 'plastickish' Sumsung and not many buy premium quality Sony phones) Nevertheless I see it as one of the most important aspects of a phone next to user experience.<br/><br/>+ Stock Android is hands down the best version of Android out there, I really don't understand why would some companies use a lame customised skin rather than stock. I've seen some very awkward Android skins and this is way superior than any other Android phone out there, I just don't get it.<br/><br/> **********<br/><br/>As for the -ves<br/>- The edges are slightly sharper  and narrower than I would've liked. I'll probably forget about it, but I just hope Motorola would adjust this small issue in future devices.<br/><br/>-A bit slippery at times, just be careful not to use this device at risky places, like in the bathroom.<br/><br/>-The vibration while typing isn't very satisfying. This is not a fault or anything, everything works fine, but just the vibration feeling isn't that of quality.<br/><br/>I bought this phone with one thing in my mind : This is the best phone on the planet right now, and make no mistake after 1 week of using this gorgeous device I believe my claim to be true. Pull the trigger my friend and get this device, you will not regret it.
I will keep this one short and sweet. I picked this phone up for Project Fi. I am a tech junky and was looking for a reason to pick one up. To give you an idea of the phones I currently own. I have the following or had the following in the last couple months.<br/><br/>OnePlus One<br/>OPPO Find 7<br/>Moto X 2014<br/>LG G4<br/>Lumia 930<br/>Moto X 2013<br/>Lumia 1530<br/><br/>With that said. I have owned small to large devices. So to get that out of the way. Yes, it is a large device. If you have small hands you probably will want to find a smaller device like the Moto X 2014.<br/><br/>I am very pleased with the Nex6. The screen is beautiful. The sound quality is amazing with its front facing speakers. The camera is good. It's not great but it will do the trick in a well lit area. Low light shots were sub par. The processing speed is excellent and have not noticed any lag to speak of. Call quality is very clear and sound is on point. I didn't run into any of the issues I have read about such as speaker issues.<br/><br/>Pro's<br/>Call quality<br/>Front facing speakers sound great<br/>Screen is amazing<br/>Build quality feels premium and sturdy<br/>No lag when playing games or multi tasking<br/>WiFi connection is strong<br/>Updates to latest OS before others<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Price is kind of high when compared to other flagship devices.<br/><br/>Camera in low light<br/><br/>Size could be considered a con for some but then again you should expect a big phone based on specs.<br/><br/>I have found it difficult to find a tempered glass protector due to the curved glass on the edges. This is a con for me.<br/><br/>Wrap up<br/>This is a very well built device. With the screen and sound quality rising above most of the other devices I have owned. I think I will keep this around for a while.
I picked this phone up to replace an iPhone 5S - so, lots of changes.<br/><br/>The Nexus 6 is big, there's absolutely no way around that.  It's larger even than the iPhone 6 Plus.  And it felt pretty bulky initially.  Worse yet, the phone seems to want to be dropped.  The shape seems to defy my ability to grip it.  I don't know how many times I've fumbled the thing.<br/><br/>But I got used to the size pretty quickly.  And the addition of a case with a rubberized texture has made it much more grip-able.<br/><br/>The screen is huge, crisp, vibrant.  It's terrific.  A massive upgrade from my iPhone.  I've been using a Galaxy Tab 7 as an e-reader fora while now, and that's no longer necessary.  Nook and Kindle books are very legible on the Nexus 6.  I have absolutely no trouble reading email and web pages.  Video playback is terrific.<br/><br/>The Nexus 6 ships with a vanilla install of Android 5.0/Lollipop.  No weird extensions or customization built-in.  It's the closest you're going to get to pure Android.  And it works well.  The interface is quick and responsive.  The visual aesthetic is consistent.  The whole thing seems a lot more intuitive than my Samsung-ified Tab 7.<br/><br/>Battery life is pretty good considering how big the screen is.  I'll routinely end the day at around 50%; where my iPhone was closer to 30% by the time I was putting it away for the day.  I really haven't had to make any effort to save power.  I'm not disabling location services or anything like that.  I suspect that if I could easily get two days of use out of a single charge if I had to.<br/><br/>The Nexus 6 came with a "quick charge" adapter that's supposed to charge to nearly-full in an hour or so, but I'm not using it.  The Nexus 6 also has Qi-compatible wireless charging built-in, so I picked up a TYLT charger and I've been using that.  It's terrific to just drop my phone on the cradle and charge it up without having to fumble with any plugs.<br/><br/>Audio is surprisingly good.  I don't generally expect much from a phone in this regard...  But the Nexus 6 has two front-facing speakers that actually deliver decent sound.  I had absolutely no trouble watching several television programs on it.  And my ringer is hard to ignore.<br/><br/>I'm a little annoyed at the lack of user-serviceable parts.  Coming from an iPhone, I was sort of looking forward to being able to swap-out my battery or throw in an SD card if I ran out of storage - but neither of those things are possible on a Nexus 6.  This doesn't bother me too much, since I've been on an iPhone for years.  But it might be a bit of a shock if you're coming from some other Android devices.<br/><br/>I had absolutely no trouble activating this device on my Verizon account.  I just pulled the SIM card out of my iPhone and plugged it into the Nexus 6.  A few minutes later I had a fully-functional phone.  I'd recommend that you might want to go in and manually set your preferred network type...  Seems like I've gotten a better signal since I manually set it to LTE instead of the default Global setting.<br/><br/>It also seems like the Nexus 6 has a better antenna than my iPhone did - I'm able to connect to wireless networks from further away, and with better signal strength.
I got this phone, refurbished, because I guess you could say I'm a bit of a cheapskate. The whole reason I needed this phone in the first place, was to use it with Google Fi, which I wanted to use to save money as well!<br/><br/>I've got to say, the phone, compared to the OnePlus One (my previous daily driver), is a BEAST as far as size goes. Without a case, however, it is comparable and nearly identical to my wife's iPhone 6+. It does make one-handed manipulations difficult, even for someone who has larger hands such as myself, but a good keyboard (<br/> in my case) with swiping and predictive input, makes it a lot less of an issue!<br/><br/>The screen is absolutely gorgeous, crystal clear and sharp! The camera takes very nice pictures, and has no lag or delays to it. As soon as you press the shutter/snap button, the picture is taken, unlike other devices where the is a momentary "blip", by which time the photo is taken, the moment to be captured has already passed.<br/><br/>I must say, my favorite part of it is the "pure" Android experience. There's never any question about whether the issue is due to the ROM, OS, hardware, other app from the OS or manufacturer. There are 2 (really 1) sources here, Motorola (Google), or Google. Also, system updates come quickly, since there is no merging in of functionality and fixes to be done, such as by other manufacturers or software/OSes.
With the lower price (currently at $399.99 for the 64GB version), there really isn't any reason NOT to get this phone. Pure android guarantees great performance without having to worry about other OEMs taking android, adding way too much custom software, and making it lag and buggy (looking at you Samsung). Plus, Nexus means you get every Android update immediately. When looking for a new phone, I picked this one over the new Moto X because the Snapdragon 805 in the Nexus 6 is actually faster than the 808 AMD 810. It's just a quad core instead of hexacore (808) or octacore (810). Plus, the GPU of the Snapdragon 805 is actually a more powerful one than in the 808. The Snapdragon 805 was actually going to be the top tier processor for a while before Apple made the huge push into 64bit processors so everyone had to catch up for some reason.<br/>The dual front facing stereo speakers are loud, clear, and sound great. The camera is good, not great, but it takes photos you won't be mad at. The screen is gorgeous, so looking at it while playing games or web browsing is a real joy.<br/>Overall, this is a fantastic phone, and since its a Nexus, will last you for a very long time.
This is one of the best Android phones on the market. It has a huge 6 inch gorgeous 2k display with AMOLED technology. It has crisp, clear, and loud front facing speakers. It has stock Android and will be supported for over 3 years. It has a great build quality and right now even the 64GB model is only $399! I know a lot of people might think that the phone is too big on paper, but even after just using it for a few minutes I don't think I could ever go back to another phone. It's easy to type on with the spacious keyboard, video watching is amazing with the big screen and front facing speakers and so is gaming. The camera is also very good as well, if you use HDR+ during low light areas, once you get the hang of it, you can take some really good photos of it. I have zero complaints on this phone. The Snapdragon 805 processor with 3GB of RAM and stock Android make this phone run blazing fast, no hints of lag or even stutters at all. Sure you might have a better camera with the Galaxy S6, Note 5, Edge+ but you are also paying double, if not more for those phones vs getting a 64GB Nexus 6.
I upgraded to N6 from my Note 2. When you move from 4G LTE to any other spectrum the mobile data connection hangs and the only way out is to do a soft reset on the data connection.  I did not see it initially for about a week. But after that the hang was so regular to the point that the phone was meaningless.  Looked around on the web and was surprised to find that I am not the only one. (Search for "Nexus 6 data connection issues"). Tried all updates and other steps that you can see on the web but no improvement. I am back to my old Note2 which works flawlessly in the same areas where N6 had connection issues. This experience makes we wonder what is the best phone for an android user.<br/><br/>Amazon's shipping and return policy was seamless and it was the only good thing to mention in this whole ordeal.
The most common complaints about the Nexus 6 have been price and battery life.  Other concerns, such as size, handling, camera quality are more subject to personal preference (see <http://www.androidauthority.com/nexus-6-review-566046>). I had dismissed upgrading because I was not prepared to pay $700 for a phone, regardless who made it.<br/><br/>At $399, this is a bargain. A 64 GB 6 inch “phablet” with an AMOLED screen and a very fast CPU and graphics processor. Still not convinced?  Compare this to an 16GB 8 inch Airpad mini WIFI-only tablet clocking in at roughly the same price, which would you choose to take on the road with you?<br/><br/>Update 10/01:  I have had the phone now for a week and I am very pleased with the purchase. Beautiful screen. Picture quality is very good in all lighting conditions except very dark. HDR+ is flawless on most shots. Battery life has not been a problem. Phone was shipped to Canada via Landmark which handled the import taxes.  Total cost landed was $426 US or $544 CND, well under the $727 CND currently in the Google Play Store.
To clarify the Verizon matter.<br/><br/>BB and above indicate it will not work with CDMA (spring and VZ).  Others indicate some sort of IMEI activation stuff.<br/><br/>I bought it at BB and was told it would NOT work.  But I had read it would.  Went home, called no one, and simply dropped my nano sim from verizon into the phone.  It found the network, and is working.  No issues at all.  This is as of 6/8/2015, things could change, but it worked fine for me.<br/><br/>I have not been able to install verizon visual voicemail, but am not too concerned with that.<br/><br/>The phone is insanely fast.<br/><br/>Update 6/18/2015<br/>I took the sim out of my properly deactivated iPhone, and it worked.  I wanted the visual voicemail because dialing for voicemail is gross.  So I got the verizon tech folks on the phone (use a different phone), and after 5 minutes and a single reset, visual voicemail was working.
The back cover was found cracked after I've used it less than a week. The quality control is so bad by Motorola which was once well known for good quality management. It's so dispoint! I should buy a iPhone at the beginning:(
This phone is my favorite phone, period! I don't mind give up my SD Card slot and external battery access for a Nexus device.<br/><br/>But I will mention a couple of things:<br/><br/>1. This phone does have support for all four major carriers. But I will tell you if you're planning on using this on Verizon or Sprint; that you need to buy the Verizon or Sprint model only. Especially for Sprint, because if you are planning on using the unlocked Google Play edition ( which this one is ) Sprint will not recognize this ESN because it's not in sprints database. Which is sort of lame and very stupid on Sprint part. Now if you're planning on using it on Verizon, and have a current Verizon nano SIM Android phone; then it should work perfectly fine. But you can't start a new line with an unlocked Nexus 6<br/><br/>2. Now if you're planning on using this on T Mobile or AT&T.; I will say that I've had one of the best experiences on both networks, but if you get it out of the box without lollipop 5.1.1 then you will be waiting a while. Unfortunately AT&T; has control over when you get that update. Supposedly it has been rolling out lately but I'm not for sure on that.... also the only network it offers HD Voice on a GSM carrier, is T Mobile. Unfortunately AT&T; doesn't have that feature turned on yet, so when you're in a call it switches over to hsdpa+. Which SUCKS , the speeds are slow and coverage isn't as go as AT&T; LTE.<br/><br/>But besides that, this phone last me all day on battery. Performs amazingly, and just does everything the Google said it would do. I only wish I had an SD card slot and removable battery. But if you're very fortunate to own a Nexus device, or have the money to own a Nexus device. Consider yourself lucky!
After experiencing all this phone's 6-inch screen glory, I can simply not go back to a smaller phone.<br/><br/>Huge? Yes. That is exactly the power of this phone, coupled with being a Nexus. The last thing for which I use a cell phone is making calls. I use it for viewing web pages, email, social applications, reading e-books and documents, maps, watching movies, sometimes a game. There is no better experience than doing these tasks in a large, glamorous screen as in the Nexus 6. Sincerely, if Google launched an ever larger phone, say 6.2, 6.5 inches, I would go for it.<br/><br/>I do not have small hands. I have no trouble navigating the phone with one hand; obviously one needs a different set of skills for that (sorry for the Liam Neeson-line) as compared with a smaller phone, but it is doable. To assist, I acquired a protecting case that features a slot for attaching a wrist-band, such that I am not afraid of dropping the phone. It fits back pockets of trousers, although I try to avoid doing so for fear of forgetting to remove the phone before sitting down (no reports of bent Nexus 6, however, as opposed to the "nine" bent iPhone 6s).<br/><br/>The phone has top-tier specifications, albeit not having a 64-bit processor. The camera takes beautiful pictures for my necessities, and the image stabilization helps immensely. For a more professional camera control, I use L-camera application. The phone does run smoothly through all applications I have thrown on it, the sound is strong and true stereo with the dual front speakers. The fast charger gives a almost 80% charge (from near zero) in about 15-20 minutes. I normally use a Qi wireless charger for overnight charging.<br/><br/>This is a Nexus phone. It signifies you can flash new Android versions as they are released before other phones, and rooting is a one-click operation. This is also the closest to a pure Android OS one can get, no carrier or manufacturer bloatware.<br/><br/>I purchased mine in December 2014. There seems to be a problem with a batch of batteries, resulting in bloated batteries (which caused the back cover of the phone to peel off) and sudden shut downs at 30, 50, 80% battery. See the reports here:<br/><br/>https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/nexus/Gna3-BT6BkA;context-place=topicsearchin/nexus/battery<br/>https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/nexus/D7er7nMbzHI;context-place=topicsearchin/nexus/battery$2080<br/><br/>Mine suffered from this problem after 4 months of purchase. I contacted Motorola, which replaced the phone in less than 24 hours, and it is operating as it should so far.
I've had this phone for about 2 months now. Here are my thoughts: Yes, its big. I'm not sure what kind of pants people are wearing who say it won't fit in their pockets. I have a minimal case on mine, fits in every pocket I've tried. The size is a plus in my opinion. After 2 days using this thing, pick up a "normal" sized phone, like an iPhone 5. You'll wonder how people use such a dinky device to get things done.<br/><br/>The Nexus 6 is top notch. Android Lollipop is beautiful, fast and clean. You don't have to wait for carrier updates, you won't get bloatware or overlays, this is pure Android. For some people, that may not matter. For me, it's a huge plus. I also like that the colors really pop on the screen. It's definitely a little more saturated than some of the other screens out there. Sound is also great. You won't realize how good the dual front facing speakers really are until you watch Netflix or listen to Spotify on this.<br/><br/>Battery life gets knocked on this phone a lot. I generally average between 4 to 4.5 hours of actual screen on time, no matter what I throw at it. That is perfectly acceptable. Especially considering I keep the screen brightness maxed at all times. Also, this thing charges very fast.<br/><br/>The camera is good, not the best out there, but you'll be able to snap great pictures (and 4k video!) with this. No complaints.<br/><br/>I guess my only small gripe is the screen could be a BIT brighter. I like my screens to be blindingly bright, and although this is very bright, there are phones available that are a little brighter.<br/><br/>With its high end specs and stock Android, I think this phone is absolutely worth the price tag. Also, I'm using Straight Talk with this. No problems there, either. Hope this review helps.
As a former iPhoner with a now-long history of Android devices, I love the Nexus 6. It is the first Android phone that I truly love and think hangs with the latest iPhone in every way.<br/><br/>For context, I've had an HTC Evo, iPhone 3G, Samsung Galaxy S3, Moto X, and I just replaced my Moto X 2014 with the Nexus 6.<br/><br/>Let's get the first thing out of the way - the phone is really big. It's so big that I've pretty much had to retire two pairs of semi-skinny jeans because they're too uncomfortable with the phone. It's so big that I had to get a new phone mount for my car because the size and weight was too much for my trusty mount to handle.<br/><br/>As someone who always wears small/medium sized gloves, I've had to say goodbye to one-handed texting. I realized that I was already texting with two hands on my Moto X 2014 with the 5" screen, so that's really not any different than using any of the latest generation of big phones (iPhone 6+, LG G3, Samsung Galaxy S5 or S6) for me.<br/><br/>That being said, like with any phone, you get used to it really fast. Visually, the phone doesn't even look big to me anymore. I'm sure it looks ridiculous to others to see someone with Hobbit hands (me) using a tablet for a phone, but hey, doesn't bother me. I was already two-hand texting before this and found that it stops me from texting and driving. I'm good with all of the above.<br/><br/>**The Good**<br/>- BATTERY: My phone's battery is as good as any Android device I've ever had. I consider myself a medium to heavy user (texts, Bluetooth, camera, navigation throughout the day) and my phone is fine with a single charge for the day. I usually give it a short boost in the afternoon because I'm sitting at my desk (most of us are), but it could easily make it from 7AM to 10PM on a single charge.<br/>- CAMERA: The camera on the Nexus 6 is really great. My wife has an iPhone 6 and our pictures are very comparable, especially when I use HDR+. Coming from the Moto X 2014, the Nexus 6 camera is a HUGE improvement. The details are sharp, colors more accurate, and the camera boots up pretty quick.<br/>- SPEAKERS: If you listen to music or watch videos on your phone, you'll be really impressed with the Nexus 6 front facing speakers. They are clear and loud. If you've heard an iPhone's speakers when watching a YouTube video, imagine it getting about 50% louder and sounding more full. While I wouldn't, I could actually see myself watching a whole movie without being concerned about sound on my phone. It's also really good for hearing calls in a loud room.<br/>- SCREEN: While I haven't had the latest generation of Galaxy phones, the Nexus 6 screen is great. Even with a bigger screen, you're not making sacrifices on resolution. Videos look great, everyday icons look sharp, and text is really easy to read.<br/>- BLUETOOTH: This is less of an issue for phones these days, but I remember the days when Bluetooth sucked on some phones. I pair my Nexus 6 with my Beats Studio Wireless 2's and car's Bluetooth no problem. It sounds great, connects quickly, and I've had significantly fewer complaints about sound quality or people not understanding what I"m saying.<br/>- CHARGER: The Nexus 6 comes with one of the "turbo" chargers that can cost $40 from some places. When your battery life is low, the turbo charger will charge your phone faster than a regular charger. A really low amp charger can take 3 hours to charge the Nexus 6, the included charger will get you pretty solid within an hour and change.<br/>- SIZE: Once you get used to the fact that you're probably going to be a two-hand texter, the screen size of the Nexus 6 is really awesome. It's so easy to show things to people, read, and research using shopping apps with your phone. It makes other phones look like Fisher Price baby phones.<br/>- OS: As a Nexus device, you get the latest versions of Android (I'm on 5.1 right now) with the latest features, bug fixes, and performance improvements. 5.1 has been very smooth and responsive for me with great battery life. I personally love Google Now and have most things synced with Google products, so staying in Android land is great for me.<br/>- CARRIER SUPPORT: Because I bought my Nexus 6 directly from Google Play, I can use my phone on any major carrier in the United States. I just popped my Verizon SIM into my phone from my Moto X 2014 and got up and running. If I ever wanted to switch to T-Mobile, AT&T;, or god forbid, Sprint, I could use the same phone. If you buy your Nexus 6 from Verizon, I don't believe it'll support other carriers.<br/>- RESPONSIVE: Better than any other Android phone I've owned, the Nexus 6 is snappy and responsive. Flipping from screen to screen is just as fast and smooth as it is on Phone, the phone unlocks quickly, and notifications are pretty easy to swipe and handle. Responsiveness has always been my biggest gripe with Android phones and this phone has me in love with my phone again.<br/><br/>**The Bad**<br/>- PICKY WITH CHARGERS: I thought my Moto X 2014 was really picky about chargers and cords, but the Nexus 6 has proven even to be even more of a charging diva. Say goodbye to all your $1 micro-USB cords and random charging plugs you've used over the years, the amp-hungry Nexus 6 only wants the best. I would guess that about 50% of your chargers will probably work with the Nexus 6, you'll have to step your game up with the others.<br/>- NO SLOW MOTION VIDEO: While capturing regular video is great and clear, the lack of slow motion video is one of the only things I find that I "miss" with the Nexus 6. My Moto X 2014 had slow motion video that we loved when taking videos of the dogs, but now we're limited to using my wife's iPhone for slow motion videos.<br/>- TEXT MESSAGE SET UP: Since the Nexus 6 tries to have you use Hangouts as your default texting app, you might run into a little weirdness. All of my texts were going to my wife's computer when she was signed into Gmail, when I wanted them to go to her phone. As a result, my picture and video messages didn't go through. I downloaded and switched to using the Google Messenger app and ever since, everything is working like you'd expect. Group text messages are all good (even with iPhones), picture messages are quick, and everything is all good.<br/>- WEIGHT: With the size and battery, the phone is heavier than pretty much any other phone you've touched in the modern era.<br/><br/>All in all, if you're already texting with two hands, the Nexus 6 is really not a huge adjustment. If you already carry a phone in your purse, then it's not really all that different to have a bigger phone. If you wear a lot of skinny jeans and don't think your fashion sense will ever change, then I might  think twice about getting the Nexus 6. It will jab into your leg and thighs.<br/><br/>In the end, the Nexus 6 is the best Android phone I've ever used with a battery life and camera that can stand up to the iPhone 6 (other than slow motion video, womp womppp). Android 5.1 is the smoothest and most responsive OS I've used yet (and I really liked Android 4.4). It's a big phone that has some weight to it, but I love that it's a premium device that is paving the way for Android devices.
Smashed the screen on my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 so decided to "upgrade" to the Nexus 6 (I'm not brand loyal but refuse to buy anything made by Apple). This is my first non-Samsung cell since a 2-yr stint with the HTC G1 prototype, and so far this Nexus is a joy to work with. Here are some things I noticed:<br/><br/>Sound quality: audiobooks and my calls sound very noticeably clearer than on the Note 3 (using the same headset). This isn't solely my subjective opinion, as I was also told that it sounds better (like "being in the same room") by someone I speak with frequently. N6 wins.<br/><br/>Apps: no Samsung bloatware here, which is generally a good thing. N6 wins.<br/><br/>Interface: no S Pen stylus... which isn't bothering me yet. I prefer to take notes using my voice with "OK google", but this isn't practical for all situations, so only time will tell.<br/><br/>Tactile: N6 touchscreen seems slightly more responsive than the Samsung, but that's probably just because the zippier processing power leads to quicker reactions from the apps. Whatever the case, N6 wins.<br/><br/>Body: I liked the faux leather back on the Note 3, but the body of the Nexus 6 has a nice contour and fits in my hand well. If you have dainty hands it may seem a bit cumbersome, but it's perfect for me and I already like it better than the Note 3, which was elegant but could be oddly difficult to get a solid grip on sometimes. The Nexus 6 is heavier than the Note 3, but I don't see why that would be a disadvantage unless you have extremely weak arms. Some people won't like that it isn't flat (it doesn't sit still when you place it on a flat surface), so it's a tradeoff: would you rather have comfort while holding your device, or a phone that will lay flat on the table? My test for a phone being too big is this: does it fit in your pocket? It fits in mine, so this Nexus passes my simple litmus test for what constitutes a phone.<br/><br/>Battery life: this of course is what some people care about most. I honestly don't notice much of a difference between this and the Note 3... which may be a bad thing for Motorola since this is supposed to be a "next gen" cell that is competing with Note 4. If you are a heavy data user then you might be bummed out by the battery life of the N6. Still, there are some who will complain about battery life no matter what...<br/><br/>Speed: it is noticeably faster than the Note 3, as one would expect. If you are accustomed to using fast desktops, then you won't be disappointed with the N6.
No performance issues whatsoever. Front facing speakers are loud and clear and the camera is flawless in daylight and OK in low light. All-day battery life with mixed usage. and four hours of on-screen time at 50% brightness. Hands down the best smartphone I've ever owned.
I like the Nexus 6 very much. I particularly like the size and quality of its screen, except for its maximum level of brightness, which should be brighter.  The phone was a great price when I bought it, but not as great as the price currently on Amazon. It's so low, it's tough not to buy another one and just use it a a tablet...there's wireless everywhere in the city.<br/>Since this is a Google Play device, it gets all the OS updates immediately and it doesn't have the overlay every other company puts on top of Lollipop. That's huge for me. While it's much better now, Samsung's TouchWiz (I've had 4 premium Samsung phones and various tablets), for instance, started out as just a ridiculously dominating experience.<br/>I really like the ghostly appearance of notifications that come on when I pick up the phone, and navigation is just the best in pure Android 5.1. Better even than my iPhone 6 Plus, in fact (don't ask why I have both...just a tech nut). I also love the 6" screen, and can really tell the difference in usability between it and the size most phablets are (5.5"). You wouldn't think a half inch would matter. It does.<br/>The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the original price was waaay too high for a phone still using a massive plastic back. At the original price level, it should have been all metal or at least all metal and glass. At these lower prices, it's no longer an issue of getting what you pay for, and therefore, I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could.
Buggy, keeps  crashing apps, or gets "stuck", forcing to to power off, sometimes 2-3 times at a time. Love the screen, decent battery ( but keep closing those background pages, click the square at the bottom)<br/> bottom line - i shoulda gone with a Samsung....
This phone is recommend for big hand.  The build quality on the phone is above average not excellent.  The micro USB port (aluminium frame with plastic together) build quality is bad not in the center.  I would said check out the Nexus 6P before buying this nexus 6.
1st things 1st. This is an UNLOCKED phone and I have it running on the Verizon post paid network. I took it to a Verizon store and they were unable to activate it without calling for help from a higher level tech. Even then it took over an hour. If the store you go to is very busy, they very well might blow you off and say it can't be done. I'm here to tell you IT CAN! Make sure that they check the network settings on the phone and switch it over to LTE 1st and DON'T have the WiFi on. It'll mask the LTE activation. I had an existing account and they activated a new SIM. So ignore the reviews that say it can't be done. Very cool phone! Nice to have clean, pure Android with the updates 1st. I have big hands so the phone is easy to use. The screen is bright and easy to read. Coming from a Note 4 its a very easy transition. I'm a little put off by the fact that they decided to not include a SD card slot. With such a premium phone why not? The battery life is pretty good. I've been on it a LOT and it does well. I'll be kicking the tires good for the next week and I'll let you know how it feels once Lollipop 5.1 hits it.
There are tens of professional reviews released around Shamu's debut last fall.  This pure Android phone is smooth, no jankiness, no hangups, no slowness.  I believe this is the best Android phone currently available; maybe the Nexus phones will surpass and maybe the Moto X Pure will as well.  I believe that good software can put hardware over the top and that is why the Nexus 6 is best.  Samsung makes the best screens; my GS6 and Note 4 before it are marvelous screens with marvelous cameras.  Hearkening back to the software opinion, that's why I bought this 9 months after release; I could no longer deal with abdominal skins like Touchwiz.  The only true drawback to this phone is its width, that takes some getting use to.  This is the Nexus without compromise, the first in some time: quick charge, wireless charge, UHD screen, front facing stereo speakers, and pure delicious Vanilla Android.  Go get it, you'll love it.
This review is geared towards Sprint customers and what to expect to get your new Unlocked Nexus 6 US CDMA version activated. This phone WILL WORK WITH SPRINT but READ THIS FIRST! You may run into some roadblocks getting a sim card for this phone so call ahead and make sure they have them in stock prior to receiving this phone. You'll want to make sure they actually put their eyes and hands on the SIM card prior to you making a trip to the store. I ended up wasting most of the day trying to get this phone activated due to more than one store telling me they had the sim card, then waiting my turn in line only to be told that they didn't have the sim card after all. Special thanks Paul at the Leawood KS Sprint Store for Excellent customer service and finally getting this day long ordeal resolved!<br/><br/>The correct Nano Sim Card for this phone is Part Number: SIMGLW426C. (It is free and provided by Sprint when you activate your new phone.)<br/>The Sprint part number that they will use in store for the SIM card is: 760494000114<br/>Also, make sure to take your box with you so they can scan all of the bar-codes.<br/>Do not attempt to get this phone activated at a 3rd party store. Make sure it's a corporate Sprint store. (An actual Sprint store and not some mall stand or a stand inside of another store)<br/><br/>Sprint will need to add the ESN to the network prior to activating this phone but that was not a big deal. It took a little longer than a regular activation but it only took about 20 minutes once I made my way to a store where they actually knew what they were doing.<br/><br/>So far the phone works as expected and no issues to report on the Sprint network. I've had great battery life considering I've been messing with it non stop getting it set up the way I like. It charges lightning fast too. I'll update this review if I find it worth adding to the already numerous reviews but here are a few things I noticed on day 1.<br/><br/>Be prepared for several updates to the Android O.S. and stay close to a fast WiFi Connection and let it charge. It needs to layer the updates and can't just update to the latest OS in one shot. There are a few things I didn't expect with stock android 5.1.1 that left me a bit disappointed, but I'm still happy with the phone and like how fast it is without the bloatware. A couple of real bummers for me were the absence of slow motion video and group text messaging is gone from the messenger app in Lollipop. The group messaging was easily resolved with a free 3rd party app. But as of this time, there is no viable solution for the lack of Slow motion video which I used often at work. Other than that, I haven't really found much that I can't resolve with a 3rd party app other than the limited vibration options. I will update further if anything else comes up.
Beautiful screen. The body is a fingerprint magnet. Really fast and volume is decent. But when doing somethings the volume doesn't work properly. (Liking posts on Facebook, the first ring of a call and more.) Also you will need a good case. The phone is really thin and slippery. Biggest complaint. HORRIBLE battery life. And I know all of the tricks to conserve battery. I've had Android phones since the G-1.<br/><br/>UPDATE____________________________________<br/><br/>I got my replacement on Tuesday. Amazon was very polite and fast. But I may be returning it as well. Battery life is dreadful. I used to own a cell phone store and I know all the tricks to preserve battery life. This phone really struggles. Such a disappointment. I really like the phone.<br/><br/>Second update________________________________<br/><br/>The second unit suffers from even worse glitches. Not very happy
With the new model out, this model fell to a price point where I felt comfortable enough to buy it. It's been a week, and I'm very happy with the phone. The slim edges made it a little hard to handle; a small issue that was easily fixed by adding a SUPCASE. The combination actually made it fit my Delta Cycle Bike mount XL much better too! Blazing LTE speeds, loud dual front firing speakers, strikingly rich Quad HD screen, Qi wireless charging (which has been dropped on the new model) and Turbo charging... I honestly doubt that the average Joe would really need anything better or newer. At a price that's way lower than an equivalent but smaller sized unlocked phone with less memory, and considering this was the flagship phone for Google just last year, I think this is a no-brainer!
Pros:<br/>Performance, screen, price, appearance.<br/>Disadvantages:<br/>Sound, camera.<br/>In "Google" always get a pretty good smartphones and tablets by pure Android on board, so price for such characteristics. Nexus 6 is no exception. Undoubtedly, the main advantage is its performance here on the board quite a powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon processor with a frequency of 805 MHz, 2700, the new Adreno 420 video processor and 3 GB of RAM. The screen resolution is quite large, the picture is very juicy. A bit pumped up the sound from the speakers, it is not as loud and big as we would like. Camera - 4-no much outstanding performance has not. Battery - a double edged sword, has a short battery life, but charged very quickly.
Having quite a blast so far with this phone. Even though, it's quite big in size and some may find it a little challenging to fit into their pockets, but what it has to offer is beyond goodness. Powerful Snapdragon chip, a big and high definitive screen, very responsive as well. The only minus point is battery life. If you limit your usage to only phone calls, sending and receiving messages, then it will last at least 3 days without the need to recharge. But heavier use such as playing games, browsing the web will reduce the battery from max to zero in about 10 hours. However, with the help of the Turbo Charger, you will get another 5 to 10 hours back with only 15-30 minutes of charging. Over all, I'm really satisfied with it.
This phone is my daily driver. Yes it is big and you will either like that feature or you will not. It fits in my pocket with no problems but I don't wear 'skinny' jeans, people who do might have an issue. The screen is very nice (I like the saturation of OLED) and because of the size everything is easy to read. The processor is fast and I haven't really noticed any lagging. The price I paid, about $515, is very reasonable. No more contract phones for me. This phone is the first Nexus device I have owned and I like the fact that I get updates without having to wait for Samsung and AT&T; to add their bloatware. As far as flagship Android phones go, if you can live with the size of the phone, this is the best bang for the buck.
I love this phone.  For now on I think I'm staying with the Nexus line.  It takes too long to get OS updates with non-Nexus devices in my opinion.  Also, I like the feel of stock Android much better.  I will say the first one I ordered was defective.  It would reboot randomly, multiple times a week.  Even after numerous factory resets per instruction from Motorola it still continued to reboot.  Motorola was going to warranty it, but I called Amazon first.  I was about 6 days past the 30 day replacement policy, but I called and they replaced it regardless.  This new one is perfect!  It has not randomly rebooted at all.  I have had this for over a month, so I am know it's good to go.  Enjoying Project Fi at the moment.
Phone arrived in perfect condition as expected, new/unopened box. Things I like:<br/><br/>- Big, beautiful screen.<br/>- Stock Android!<br/>- Camera has produced some great quality shots! (See images)<br/>- Fast! It doesn't even flinch moving from one app to another<br/>- Dual, front-facing speakers sound good<br/>- 32 GB, enough storage for day-to-day use and several games<br/><br/>I thought it would be uncomfortable because of the size but after a week's use I can safely say it's not. I thought 5.5" was my limit but after using this beauty I never want to go below 6" again. Time will tell but so far this is shaping up to be my best investment yet, cell-phone wise. Highly recommended.
The Nexus 6 is an amazing smartphone. The display is big, bright and crisp. The cameras take flawless pictures and video. LTE and an all day battery keep me going wherever I am. The processor makes Android Lollipop scream and with 64 GB of onboard storage, I'm never at a loss for space for music, photos and whatnot.<br/><br/>There's just one caveat: that gorgeous display comes at a price. The device itself is big. REALLY big. So big that I find myself reverting back to my Nexus 5 unless I know I'm going to need to take great pictures or need the use of an all day battery.<br/><br/>But now that the price has come down, it was worth it to buy one. And I got it in white! Bonus!
The best experience with raw Google Lollipop. Coming from a Galaxy S4, this phone is night and day. Never will I return to the touchwiz interface that Samsung spoils Android with.<br/><br/>The camera and display on the phone are fantastic. Could be a hair better, but still an improvement over my old phone and above par of most current phones. While the phone is huge, it really doesn't take long before the 5.9 inches feels normal.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this phone is the best complete package. It might not have ground breaking individual specs and all the useless features, but it provides the best overall experience.
Just as described. Perfect condition. Works flawlessly! Shipped and delivered extremely fast. Thanks! .
I want to clarify for all those who are asking, I purchased the 32gb White Nexus 6.  If purchased from Amazon, the model I received is the XT1103.  I am a Verizon customer, and was able to take my existing activated nano sim from previous phone and drop it into the Nexus 6, the phone activated instantly with full 4G LTE functionality.  Absolutely love the phone.  If the size doesn't bother you ( which, why would you be here if it did), and you must have the vanilla android experience, complete with OEM bootloader unlock.  Then this is the phone for you.
Love this phone! I feel like it's an appropriate upgrade and a great as a first time phablet if you previously used a Nexus 5 like I have. Much more powerful, crispy screen and improved hardware. People who are saying this is a large phone. It is. But I also believe people are overreacting. Yes it's big, but if you're looking at this phone in the first place you aren't concerned about that, it's an overall great android experience. I also get lots of complements on this phone too, mostly from apple and samsung users! Highly recommend!
This works with Verizon, you just have to move your SIM from old phone to new phone. If your SIM is too big, just cut down your old SIM card to fit this slot. I know it sounds crazy, but it works as long as you don't cut it too small. I took the SIM from my S4, cut it down with an exact knife, then put it into this and it works fine. It shows up as "unrecognized" device in my Verizon Wireless online profile, but who cares. I still have full unlimited data and LTE/calls/text all work great.
I love the freedom of unlocked phones when combined specially with T-Mobile. The nexus 6 is hard to beat and for the current price is even a better bargain. Doesn't have all the bloatware of carrier phones and the software updates come directly from Google with not much waiting like you would have to from the carrier software testing.<br/>The phone performs almost to the level of a Note 4 but again the Nexus 6 is clean Android without having to root it like a Note 4 would have to be.
Pros:<br/>Nexus devices get the latest and greatest android, untouched as google intended it.<br/>Camera is among the best in class for smartphones.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>while it may be compact for a 6" screen device, it's still big and heavy.<br/>OLED screen is great, but this is not the latest gen OLED screen like samsung puts on the S6.<br/>qualcomm 805 CPU is built on 28nm tech, while state of the art is 14nm like in the galaxy s6<br/>no fingerprint reader/login/security<br/><br/>Summary:<br/>It's the best android phone because the software comes from google without 3rd parties messing with it, but the hardware is not currently (5/2015) state of the art... and for those who want a phone that fits in their pants pocket, this and any other 6" or 5.5" phone probably won't.<br/><br/>Advice:<br/>Wait for a new nexus 5 or whatever they launch in the 2nd half of 2015.
This phone had decent battery life; not great not bad either. Had to return it because of the display quality. It is impossible to read anything on it at night; it turns pink and if you turn off the adaptive brightness it becomes too bright even on the lowest setting. The speakers are amazing tho. Like super loud and super high quality. This phone is worth it if you don't care about the display quality and the battery life.
I really wish I could give this phone 5 stars but I can't.  The phone is gorgeous, it has all the features I want it to have.  So, why you might ask, do I only give it 3 stars?  Well, before you decide to jump and buy Nexus 6 phone from Google, do yourself a favor and start doing searches on all problems related to cell data connectivity with this phone.  It simply sucks!  I "upgraded" from my Samsung Galaxy S3, a great phone I never had any problems with.  Where I consistently was getting 4G with my S3 and 4 to 5 bars, with my Nexus 6 I get 'H' and 2 bars.  When I started to scour the internet if there are any issues, I found a ton of articles and complaints from people sharing the same story I have.  Predominantly it revolves around T-Mobile networks which I find curious because it seems that Google considers T-Mobile as one of the leaders in the mobile industry.<br/><br/>All in all, if you do not mind frustrations with the cell data transfers, the phone is great, the audio is much better and clearer than my Samsung phone.  But was it worth the jump?  At this point, I am having second thoughts.
Works great!  I was able to give my wife my Nexus 5 so we could change carriers and get better service.  It was easy to unlock the bootloader and load a custom ROM.  My only negative is the design for the placement of the power and volume.  I wish they were in a different position since they get mostly covered by my car cradle.
I still had been using an older iPhone, 4S and it was beginning to have some software issues, freezing up, Etc.<br/>Decided it had been time to upgrade to a new phone, checked out reviews on new phones and my girlfriend had a Nexus 5. With the reviews, many had said that the Nexus 6 is a top notch phone. Also my girlfriend being very happy with her Nexus 5, having toyed around with her phone, decided on the Nexus 6 from Motorola via Amazon.<br/>I couldn't be happier, the Nexus 6 is a fantastic mobile device. From the shape of the phone, it's speed (it is fast), video quality and really loving it's sound quality. I'm very big on having music to listen to as I take a train daily with a total of 3 hours commute time. I picked up the Sennheiser CX 300 II earbuds and I'm highly impressed with the sound that comes out of the Nexus 6, Sennheiser earbuds combo.<br/>Battery life is excellent, plenty of storage space with 32 gigs, all the options that comes with having an Android phone, it allows for so much control of their software and no bloatware. All apps run smoothly, OS (Lollipop) runs smoothly, hardware and software controls run smoothly.<br/><br/>The only issue I did have had nothing to do with the phone itself, it had to do with using Verizon as a carrier. I have read that it shouldn't be an issue to bring an unlocked Nexus 6 to Verizon but I had called them directly, their customer service and one of their local stores, they said they didn't support the unlocked Nexus 6. Thought maybe it's because they now have their own Verizon, Nexus 6? Which they're charging twice as much as you can get the Nexus 6 here on Amazon.<br/>In any case, I went to a local AT&T; store, had the phone up and running in 10 minutes. I actually have a better deal now with using AT&T;, unlimited calls, texting (Internationally too) and 4 gigs of data per month. Whatever data I do not use, carries over to the next month. With Verizon I had unlimited calls, texts (domestic) and 1 gig of data for $12 less per month. Still may try out Project Fi, I encounter coverage issues in northeastern NJ and in NYC with AT&T.;<br/>I like the Nexus 6 so much that I bought an additional Nexus 6 one a week ago for my girlfriend as a Christmas gift.<br/>I highly recommend the Nexus 6 all around, quality build and brand, quality hardware, quality software which in turn provides excellent sound and video. Everything is fantastic about this phone, you definitely won't be disappointed.
Even a year after release, the Nexus 6 is still a solid choice for those looking for a reasonably priced phone that performs well:<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>+Stock Android, get your updates quickly<br/>+No custom overlays or carrier bloatware bogging down the phone<br/>+Runs smoother than some higher end phones<br/>+Excellent battery life since Android 6.0 Marshmallow<br/>+Awesome Quad HD AMOLED screen displays deep blacks, saturated colors<br/>+Excellent placement of power/volume keys, they give a nice tactile feedback<br/>+U.S. version is unlocked and works Verizon as well as GSM carriers.<br/><br/>OBSERVATIONS:<br/>=This phone is huge, but after awhile you get used to it. Probably best for large hands.<br/>=While the camera is very good, some 2015 models are quite a bit ahead now with detail and options.<br/>=While the AMOLED screen is great, it does have yellow or pink hues depending on brightness settings; Several 2015 models have more consistent and brighter white displays.<br/>=Midnight blue back is a fingerprint magnet, and matte finish wears smooth with extended use, a case is recommended<br/>=While the curved shape makes the phone easier to hold, it wobbles when texting on a table.<br/><br/>All in all, the Nexus 6 seems to hold it's own. 2015 has brought advancements to camera quality, screen quality and a bump to 4 GB of RAM. If the absolute best camera quality is your number 1 priority, you might look elsewhere. Given that most 2015 advancements were fine tuning already amazing features, the Nexus 6 is plenty powerful and feature packed, even now. If size is a concern, I recommend seeing the phone in person at a local carrier store.  This is a great choice for those who doesn't want (or have the option of) a 2 year contract. 2015 flagship phablets often run $500-700 so this is a great deal on a solid phone.
While this is certainly an excellent phone, with a beautiful 2560x1440 display, good camera, and surprisingly comfortable for it's colossal size, I had several issues with mine, which ultimately caused me to return the phone.<br/><br/>First, the top speaker hisses/crackles, particularly when the battery is low. This was very noticeable on my particular device, and even affected call quality. To me, this was unacceptable for a $400 device (I had the 64GB model)<br/><br/>Second, the battery life was very poor, in my experience. I had bluetooth off, brightness set to approximately half, with adaptive brightness enabled, and was pushing two email accounts to the phone. On a typical day, this type of usage would net me approximately 8-9 hours of standby with 2 hrs of screen-on time. This phone had me constantly tethered to a charger during long periods of movie-watching.<br/><br/>Third, I had issues with the touchscreen responsiveness. Certain areas of the screen were more responsive than others, which led to some frustration, particularly when marking up PDF documents for grad school classes.<br/><br/>So, now for the good:<br/><br/>1. Camera takes excellent pictures, even in low light where digital noise performance was impressive<br/>2. Before encountering the speaker hiss issue, the stereo front-facing speakers were impressive for a smartphone speaker. Though there wasn't a lot of bass, this is to be expected on a device this small.<br/>3. Qualcomm QuickCharge 2.0 is simply incredible. I could get a full charge on the 3220mah battery in less than 90 minutes. Having this capability was invaluable several times due to the short battery life I experienced<br/>4. The display is simply the best I have seen on any smartphone to date. (My personal opinion, not necessarily 100% correct.) If you are used to the highly-saturated and contrasty images such as those displayed on Samsung smartphones, you may be disappointed. However, colors are still displayed evenly and naturally, the display, especially text is razor-sharp and just a joy to look at.<br/><br/>I really wanted this phone to work well, and loved so many features of the phone. I may have just gotten a lemon, but the speaker hiss and battery drain issues are common problems with this phone.
I was on the fence between the Nexus 6 and LG G4 for Verizon service. I have unlimited data due to being grandfathered in and love taking advantage of that fact. I have always envied the Nexus line of phones for being both well priced and pure android.<br/><br/>I had a lot of deciding factors as to why I went with the Nex6 over the G4 so this review will compare but can still be taken as a pro's/con's review.<br/><br/>I've personally always been a mod/root kind of phone user and if I see something I don't like I want to change it. I also love storing huge flac files for offline music listening. I love AMOLED and find the newer displays to have a lower angle of viewing. Coming from my Samsung S4 I find it more familiar I suppose. I know at this point there are better cameras out there than what is included with the Nex 6 but I didn't by the phone to take amazing photos, I just don't want potato photos.<br/><br/>The Nex 6 is fully customizable. Even if you don't root or do anything crazy this phone is still cleaner and has no bloat or UI junk that slows down phones and eats up cpu cycles. The Nex 6 does not have a removable SD Card slot or removable battery. Coming from the S4 I will miss these features but I think I'm techy enough to be able to replace my own battery down the road if need be. Lack of SD card means less storage but I'll just have to switch to HQ MP3 or stream which shouldn't be the deciding factor and it wasn't. I compared several TOPL phones and found QHD phones tended to have viewing angle issues. At angles that weren't perfect 90 degrees to your face there was a very slight darkening on the top or bottom of the display. AMOLED has no issue like this or at least the Nex 6 doesn't at all. Other displays show colors brighter and better but for the sake of the extra few screen space it was a welcome sacrifice. I was able to take some very nice photos and got the job done. Focus was fast and faster than my S4 so no complaints.<br/><br/>Only real downside I have is the pink tint the screen gets when the brightness is 'very' low. I either read or saw in a video review, not sure which, that people were claiming that the pink tint was a 'feature' but it actually wasn't. It was a flaw in the AMOLED display. The reason why it's present on the Nex6 and not other TOTL AMOLED screens is they tend to limit the lowest brightness to prevent it from getting to that point. That said the Nex 6 can get very very dark and the pink tint gets worse the lower it goes. Having the option to look pink and get darker vs not I'd rather have go darker.<br/><br/>Long story short, I went ahead and ordered it and everything went as smooth as butter. I received the XT1103 (US) running 5.0 version LNX07M (developer).<br/><br/>Is how I got it working was simply cutting my 'active' Micro Sim Card I had in my Samsung S4 (Verizon) and plugging it into the Nexus 6. I boot the Nex 6 up and in less than 5 mins I was connected to LTE and data was working and I was registered on the network.<br/><br/>I did however not get any notifications for OTA updating to 5.1.1 or anything so I had to flash it using some tools but after some usual basic issues everything went smoothly and I'm on 5.1.1 (LMY47Z).<br/><br/>I'm sure this review was a little spotty and all over the place but hopefully I covered most concerns. I was having a hard time deciding between this Nex 6 and other TOTL phones but ultimately it came down to being more open to do whatever I want to do with, almost instant android updates vs being dependent on other companies to eventually drop support and updates their device for newer. I'm still able to put the newest version of Android on my 2012 Nexus 7 and it runs as smooth as butter.<br/><br/>Any questions feel free to ask! For those who are wondering, yes this does work with Verizon. I'm sure Verizon stores can activate it with a new sim but for me it worked by using my current SIM (even though I had to resize it to fit). Just make sure you have a XT1103 version and an active SIM card.
Ok, so it also happens to be the only 6 inch phone ever made. Minor technicality.  The only real competitor might be the Sony Z Ultra from 2 years ago.  But that is 6.4 inches, not 6!<br/><br/>I've had it for 5 days and so far it's the best phone I've had.  No stutters, or lag anywhere so far, but this usually takes time as you add more apps and more stuff starts to run in the background.  Not all of my apps were automatically reinstalled from Google, which is odd since it worked on all the previous phones.  At the same time this gives me a fresh start so it's not a big deal.<br/><br/>The 6 inch screen is fantastic.  It's definitely the right size for me.  So far it fits in to the front pockets of all my pants and jeans.  I will say that I like pants with good size pockets though.  Just for reference, I have a Note 3 for work and I can keep both the Note 3 and the N6 in one front pocket.  However, that is one bulging pocket!  So now each pocket has a phone in it.  For work I usually wear Banana Republic chinos.  I think a 1080p screen would have been fine, but the 2k screen is excellent.  I thought the colors might be a bit over-saturated, but they're very well balanced.  The blacks, of course, are fantastic.<br/><br/>The front facing speakers are also excellent.  I don't think quite as good as the M8/M9, but significantly better than everything else out there, although I haven't heard the Sony Z3 yet and I've read a lot of good things about it as well.<br/><br/>The camera is also quite good.  It's a big step up from the camera in my Xperia Z, in particular with the auto settings.  I haven't gotten in to the manual settings yet and I can't tell if there are any.  But that was the best way to shoot with the Z, the auto always used a really high ISO setting which always made noisy images.  No issues with noise yet with a few pics I've taken.  The auto settings handle back lighting much better than the Z and better than the Note 3 camera.<br/><br/>Other reasons I decided on the N6.<br/><br/>1. I'm no Tmo and this phone has band 12 support.  So as the network re-farm continues I'll eventually get better building coverage.<br/><br/>2. Project Fi.  I'm also considering switching over the Project Fi.  I'm still on the fence about this since I think at most it would save me $20/month on service and I'd have a lower priority on the network.  But recently I pretty consistently use less than 3 GB/month and some months were only 1 GB.  So I could save a couple bucks.
I went with the Nexus 6 for my love of stock Android, and wanting something larger than the screen I had on my Droid Maxx. I should start off with my hands are average sized. I'm only 5'11, shorter fingers with medium sized palms. The phone isn't easy to one-hand, but it's doable. If you're considering this phone, it's because you want a large phone and whether or not you can operate it wouldn't be an issue because you'd make it work regardless.<br/><br/>Design:<br/>It's great. I put a clear case on it so I wouldn't scratch the phone itself but I'd still be able to look at it or show it off. It catches eyes. A lot of people ask if it's the iPhone 6+ just because of the size, but when you explain what it is and show them the phone, it usually gets a reaction of pure aww.<br/><br/>Camera:<br/>I'm not a professional photographer. I take pics of my car, stuff at work, and time spent with my girlfriend. The picture quality is best I've had on a phone. It might not be to the standards of the Samsung or iPhone camera's, but it's not terrible like others make it out to be. The optical image stabilization helps a lot in the low-light conditions, so I have no complaints.<br/><br/>Screen:<br/>2k Display, almost 6 inches, great vibrant colors. People have noted a yellow'ish or pink'ish tint when the brightness is turned all the way down. It's...turned...all...the...way...down. I'm not looking for the "whitest white's" when I'm in bed. That's just going to add to the brightness. I want it dull and washed out so it's not going to effect my eyes. If you disable the Adaptive Brightness, that goes away anyway.<br/><br/>Speakers:<br/>It has dual front-facing speakers that are great. They're not on par with the HTC One series of phones with the Beats/Boom Sound speakers, but there aren't hardly any phones that offer dual front-facing speakers so this one is naturally takes 2nd place in the speaker department.<br/><br/>Speed:<br/>Never had a hiccup once. Had it since November (5 months) and it never lags, never crashes, never reboots itself, it just works when I need it to work.<br/><br/>Operating System:<br/>On Android 5.1.1 now, love it, so smooth, great animations, extremely well thought out. I'm glad Google is putting the thought into their OS for a change and making it more uniform.<br/><br/>Battery Life:<br/>The battery does well enough to get me through the whole day with a single charge. I get through with about 7 hours of screen on time and pretty heavy game usage. If you're not getting the same battery life, I'd look to your service provider. A buddy of mine gets under 5 hours screen on time with T-Mobile (I'm Verizon) and you look at his battery stats, it's all searching for data. Turbo charging is a life saver though. If I forget to plug it in over night, I wake up with about 20% left, plug it in and get ready for work, when I leave I'm up to 90%+.<br/><br/>Why the Nexus 6? I don't like TouchWiz, so the Note 4 was out. I don't care for LG's UI either, so they were out. The larger screen was what I wanted, and stock android is a HUGE bonus. The Moto X 5.2" screen just wasn't big enough for me.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>It costs a lot more than Nexus's of past, but it's got a lot more in it. The camera can be better, but I don't care. Um......more bass in the front facing speakers? I don't know, I'm grasping straws for this one haha. Oh, would've like MicroSD support. 64GB was HARD to get, so I settled for 32GB. Still have decent space, but I'm usually comfortable with more.
I love the freedom of unlocked phones when combined specially with T-Mobile. The nexus 6 is hard to beat and for the current price is even a better bargain. Doesn't have all the bloatware of carrier phones and the software updates come directly from Google with not much waiting like you would have to from the carrier software testing.<br/>The phone performs almost to the level of a Note 4 but again the Nexus 6 is clean Android without having to root it like a Note 4 would have to be.
Larger size basically makes my tablet obsolete, overall fast, about ~8hr screen on time and the display is bright enough to be used outside.<br/><br/>Only downside is the display. As a user of a calibrated wide gamut LCD display I know what proper colors should look like and this display is horribly off. an example, 255 red 0 green 0 blue looks more like a dark blood orange than red. Also if you look a the display off center, the color shifts to a greenish color.
It's huge.  Yes.  But it's awesome.  It uses the last of the Krait based SoCs (clocked at 2.7 GHz).  This phone is a great way to say goodbye to the 32-bit mobile era (whose demise came too soon, thanks Apple!).  I'm using this with Google Fi, and the hardware/software experience has been great for the last few weeks.  The phone is extremely responsive, and the AMOLED screen seems to save power, even though the screen is massive.  Wireless charging works great with some Nokia DT-900 chargers.  The quick charge is impressive.<br/><br/>I had to shuffle things around my pockets to fit the phone, since my wallet and phone would create a rather unsightly bulge in my pants.  The camera is good, not great.  The shutter lag is disappointing, but I've never considered camera phones that great for Android, unless you have an Apple iPhone (or Windows Phone for that matter).<br/><br/>Battery life is stellar.  I can eek out 2 days use pretty easily (moderate use).  It helps to have a Android Wear watch, since you reduce your screen unlock/re-lock and just look at the watch instead.  GPS lock time is stellar, as it has been for the last generation or two of phones.  Speakerphone quality is good.  Bluetooth pairs quickly and reliably.  The vibrate is way too loud though.  The Nexus 4 vibrate was soothing, but maybe too subtle.  It would be nice to have an option to adjust the vibration intensity.  Right now, it's set to earthquake mode.  It's rather embarrassing in meetings, and it coincides with me going completely wide-eyes, so it's extra awkward when everyone stares at me.
I use this phone everyday on Verizon in NH. Max full bar speed test result was 65 Mbps down, but rarely get full bars, usually 1 less. Phone itself is big but thats what I wanted. I dont hold this to my head as a phone very often but it can feel silly when I talking on it since its so large. Charger makes an awful whine when done charging. Battery life gets you through the day but still have to charge nightly. WiFi Tethering doesnt work like it did for my Nexus 4, but maybe the difference is TMobile vs Verizon. I would buy this phone again, but it is not as amazing as I thought it would be. Screen size is nice, but in terms of performance its a disappointing upgrade over iphone 4s considering how much it cost even though I prefer android. I am using this with my grandfathered unlimited data plan.<br/><br/>Note on activation: This was not easy to get working on Verizon but it does work as of April, 2015. First Verizon store I went to in the mall refused to help me since the IMEI number was not in the database. They offered to sell me another one. I have some words Amazon will not let me print for them. Second verizon store was a stand alone store which was rather busy when i went. 30ish minute wait, 30ish minutes to activate, but after that it did work. the manager had a senior tech use the floor model to activate a new sim card (i did not have one in my previous non-LTE phone) for my number then transferred the sim card to my phone. if i sign into my verizon website it shows im using and unknown device, but it works fine.
Yes this phone is large. Its huge but its awesome.<br/><br/>Design: The curved back of the phone really adds to the design. It feels really nice in your hand while holding it, and it helps reach each side of the phone when using it with one hand.<br/><br/>Battery: Obviously with this big of a screen the battery life is not gonna last forever. Personally I did not have any issues getting at least a day of use out of this phone. I averaged anywhere from 4.5 to 6 hours screen on time.<br/><br/>Display: AMOLED displays are the best and the same holds true with this phone. All the colors are beautiful no matter what color it is. However, when you turn the brightness all the way down the screen looks a little pinkish. I believe this is a problem with a lot of amoled screens though.<br/><br/>Speakers: These speakers are amazing! Since the both are on top of the screen and there are two of them, they are super super loud. You will never get as good of sound with a bottom mounted speaker as opposed to these.<br/><br/>I have had no problems using this device on verizon, and i get really good signal as well.<br/><br/>The best part of this phone is the software. Pure android is the best and you can always count on getting any updates first.<br/><br/>Overall this is by far one of my favorite devices on the market. Also for how cheap it is now, you cannot go wrong with the Nexus 6.
I've owned a Nexus One, a Nexus 4, and now this Nexus 6. Like most people, I was concerned about how big this phone is. I've owned it for two weeks, and now the Nexus 4 just feels tiny. The important things most people will care about are as follows:<br/><br/>The screen is beautiful, and big. Watching videos, taking pictures, or texting is easy with that much real estate to deal with. The sound quality of the calls is superb, and the dual speakers are phenomenally good. I went with the 64gb model (blue), found cases and holsters aplenty here on Amazon, and couldn't be happier with this phone.<br/><br/>I use a Bluetooth headset and a Sony Smartwatch 2, because even with the Nexus 4, you don't have to pull your phone out every time it alerts you to a new Facebook message, text, phone call or email. When it does come out, you're able to watch clear crisp video, hear amazing audio, and browse the web incredibly fast. The battery life (under Lollipop 5.1) is also very good. I used to have to charge the Nexus 4 every night, and the Nexus 6 can go days without a charge at normal (not heavy internet/video use) use.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this phone to anyone. The pure Android experience coupled with 3 gb of ram, a fast 2.7 quad-core CPU, and the high quality of the display and the great sound? I can't think of anything bad about this phone.
11/30/2015 update: It has been 6 months started with the Chroma ROM out of the box (literally). Pretty amazing device, battery still going strong, able to squeeze 20 hours of continuous use of that UHD monster screen. This version the Nexus 6 was on sale on Black Friday for $249.00, ordered one for my father in law and another one for my brother. If you still find the US version new, buy it, you will not regret it. Since purchased, I went to the Schlitterbahn near south padre, only utilizing a simple bumper case and a glass screen protector, documented my kids on the park's waterfalls and rivers. Yes, it was wet. Turned off, pulled out of the case and turned it back on, pretty amazing device to not be water proof certified! Still going strong as of today.<br/><br/>Original comments:<br/>Please be aware of what you are buying. There are at least 2 versions of this device per storage capacity (please bear with me here): XT1100 (international = GSM only) and XT1103 (US = GSM+CDMA). Both comes in 32GB and 64GB/Blue or White varieties. Amazon doesn't not specify whether you will get the International or the US version (some sellers are doing it now). As usual, CDMA = Sprint (may or may not accept this device in their network as yet)/Verizon Wireless (tricky to get a SIM card) and GSM = T-Mobile/AT&T.; This device uses nano SIM card, same the iPhone 5, 5C, and 5S uses (get it from your provider or buy a SIM card cutter like the <br/>). Yes, it is Qi wireless Charging capable and Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 certified. Now, there are also the wireless network provider versions... If this is the device need (want), put it in your shopping cart and see how price fluctuate...Fun times, enjoy your new, EXPENSIVE Nexus 6.
Getting the Nexus 6 to work on T-Mobile USA was as simple as inserting a SIM. It activated immediately and has excellent RF performance in fringe areas, and held signal on band 12 where and iPhone 6s+ would not. All T-mobile features worked except for native android visual voice mail (waiting for marshmallow), I had to download the T-mobile VVM app. Wifi calling work seamlessly as well. Simultaneous voice/data works fine if supported by the carrier (Tmobile+ATT)<br/><br/>Best features of the phone are the clear screen (excellent for movies) and the dual forward facing speakers. The speakers are loud enough to listen to music while cycling 15-20 mph. Audio quality through headphones is exceptionally good and will even power large headphones like the Sennheiser HD650 which normally require an amplifier.<br/><br/>Performance is very fast with no hesitation even with multiple apps running. Battery life is dependent on signal, and lasted 4-5 hours on full brightness running a GPS app or about a 1-2 days under light use. The body is a bit slippery so I added a Supcase which improved the feel while offering some protection and a screen protector. For a car mount the iOttie Easy View 2 is the only holder I found that fit w case (about 3.4 in wide)
I LOVE this phone! I decided to buy unlocked in case I decide to travel overseas, I can buy a prepaid SIM and have a phone basically anywhere. Coming from a Galaxy S4, it's taken me a little while to get used to stock Android, but it's nice not having to wait for a carrier or a manufacturer to approve their own modifications to the OS before pushing them to the handset. Only comes with Google's applications installed, no other software or bloatware! The battery still lasts me about a day (24 hours) with moderate use. A little less with heavier use, but not so much that I end up without power before I get home for the night. Charging with the stock adapter is really quick as well.<br/><br/>As a precautionary note, however, it was a real pain for me to get this activated with Verizon. If you don't already have a nano SIM card through them, you'll probably have to either go through Best Buy, or get in touch with Verizon's IT department (NOT CUSTOMER SERVICE) to get your number transferred to a compatible SIM. It will work on their network, despite what they try to tell you. I ended up having to pay an extra $20 for the sim, but my phone works perfectly ever since. Not too much to not be tethered to a single carrier.
I am so glad it doesn't have the pinkish screen which I was very worried about but its a bit warm but not too yellowish. I also didnt see whats the fuss about the size. I have small hands and its fine for me to hold. I dont have any problems of gripping it, one handed.  I also did flash marshmallow so Im all set to have this phone last me long for work since Im not a power user so I'm hoping the Doze feature work but it does work on my Nexus 7 so it doesnt die that easily without it being plugged in all the time. My only complaint is the messenger so far, I can't make the background black unless I invert the colors so no custom sms features or colors like in the HTC sense unless I use hangouts like everyone else or find another messenger with a black background. Other then that, its a great phone. I do love the stereo facing speakers. Not as good quality as my HTC One M8 speakers but its good enough. The screen is perfect to me, I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab S tablet with an UHD AMOLED screen and its calibrated about the same, so no complaints at all about the Quality of the AMOLED Screen. I would say, get it in this deal before it goes back to $499, I am very satisfied of picking it up for $350.
Big upgrade from the Galaxy S4. I'm all in on Google products and this phone only made sense...especially at $350.00. I'm grandfathered unlimited data on Verizon and it works great on their network.
Let me add my 2 cents to the volumes that have been written about this phone.<br/>(I plan to keep it unless it really freaks out.)<br/>Phone back gets uncomfortably warm when its charging - 108 degrees. Not pleasant to hold.<br/>With brightness turned all the way up (not recommended for long periods as it cause slight burn-in of the amoled screen) is also reaches the same 108 degree temp, on front and back.<br/>Its very slick/slippery as are many smart phones. so it needs a case.<br/>of course the case shields against the phones radiated heat (problems solved) and provides some accident protection.<br/>I wanted a large screen so when the price cut came, I was in.<br/><br/>I think my Galaxy S5 is a better (but smaller) phone. With a better camera.<br/>Other reviews said the Nexus 6's camera wasn't as good as the best out there and I have to agree.<br/>Note, the screen brightness setting seems to affect the still photo brightness at photo capture time. (not sure)<br/>I have large-ish hands (can palm a basketball for a few seconds) so the phone's size isn't a problem.
Pros: It's a great phablet at a very good price. For the next two years you'll have the most current stock Android release. Only phone to support Project Fi. It's not a Samsung product.<br/><br/>Cons: Note 4 is superior in a few minor ways. Possibly too large if you have tiny hands.<br/><br/>Why Nexus? With Android updates must come from Google to the hardware vendor and then be pushed to the carrier for release. The process can take 6-9 months depending on the carrier and device and when the update finally arrives often their are major problems. The Nexus line of phones and tablets solves this problem. By design Nexus phone's are the reference standard for Android. When a new Android release is made available from Google it will be available for recent Nexus devices immediately, but there's also the benefit of the update not having to be handed off to the hardware vendor and to the carrier. Google works with the hardware vendor on the phones design and a deal has been negotiated with the carriers of Nexus products that ensures Nexus owners will get releases promptly.
There is much to love about the Nexus 6.  The screen, though a little "warmer" than I prefer, is exceptionally sharp and readable, even in direct daylight.  It's flat out fast, performing without lag under most circumstances.  64Gig of RAM is plenty for me.  Stock Android is a benefit, as I had the 5.1.1 OS on the phone as soon as it was released to the public.  The camera, though not the "best" on the market, is by no means "bad."<br/><br/>If you want a comprehensive, unbiased review, check out any of the major phone review sites like GSMArena or PhoneArena.<br/><br/>So why did I dock it a star?<br/><br/>Battery life is flat out bad.  Even when sitting idle, I would often see the battery drain 5% in a half-hour.  Under "normal" use, (screen off, listening to music), the battery drained far too quickly, often 10% an hour.  If I checked the battery drain page in the Settings app, I would not see high drain numbers for anything but the screen, which was rarely on.<br/><br/>Also, Google has to get LolliPop under control.  Even the 5.1.1 version required frequent reboots.  It was not unusual to require a forced reboot to get the phone to come back to life after particularly memory intensive process. I suspect a memory leak of some kind, but can't narrow it down.<br/><br/>The camera is fine for daylight shooting, but is simply not "flagship" quality.  In low light situations it was often hunting for focus and the resulting images (even with HDR+) were too grainy as to be usable.  Samsung hits a home run with its cameras.  Not sure why Motorola can't get it straight.<br/><br/>Then there is the real challenge...<br/><br/>If you have small hands, think twice.  It was virtually impossible for me to comfortably handle this phone without using two hands.<br/><br/>In short, I "wanted" to love this phone, but in the end it simply did not work for me.  I can't dock it more than 1 star, because most of the challenges I faced were not "defects," per se, but ergonomic choices that simply didn't fit my needs and goals.  I've become spoiled by the ease of LGs back-of-phone buttons, a weird placement that took me time to adjust to at first but have now become so comfortable I find myself pressing the back of the phone by instinct no matter which phone I pick up.<br/><br/>Bottom line...  At a reduced price, and as long as you are ready for the HUGE screen, unwieldy ergonomics, and less-than-flagship camera, it is a solid phone.  It's just not a phone for everybody.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Solid screen<br/>Solid performance<br/>Huge memory<br/>Stock Android<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Less-than-flagship camera<br/>Android 5.1.1 still requires too-frequent reboots<br/>Screen is very large (caveat emptor)<br/>Battery life is not worth the price of entry<br/>Lack of expansion slots, lack of removable battery
Wow is this a crazy good phone, especially for those who live in rural areas. While other reviews have covered the other excellent specs of this phone, I want to just say what a big deal it is I'm even able to write this review from my phone.<br/><br/>With the past two phones I owned, I got EDGE at my house in rural Missouri with T-Mobile. Now, with the Extended LTE technology this phone supports, I'm able to get 4G LTE and the difference is night and day. While Extended LTE isn't as fast as the LTE I get in urban areas, it's still broadband. (I'm getting 1.5Mbps) which is a huge deal for me.<br/><br/>Not only does this phone support the newest cell protocols, but it also has an incredible antenna. There used to be a special spot in my house where I got reception (2 bars of EDGE xD) with my previous two smartphones, but now I am getting LTE throughout my entire house. It just blows my mind.<br/><br/>With the price dropping because of Google's newer Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P I couldn't be happier with the price for performance.
*** Preface ***<br/><br/>For the past 6+ months I've been doing everything I can to save some money on my cell service, while still wanting to keep a smartphone. Coming from the Nexus 5, I loved that I could bring my phone to almost any carrier and not worry that I would have to deal with trading in my phone and starting a new contract. The problem, however, is that I couldn't get service with my Nexus 5 on Verizon. They were the only carrier that my phone wouldn't work on. After 6+ months with Cricket and their dreadfully slow data speeds, I had to switch, and the Nexus 6 stood as the best device to help me make that switch!<br/><br/>*** First Impressions ***<br/><br/>Let's start with the basics: The Nexus 6 is a HUGE phone. At more than 6 inches tall, it makes it extremely difficult to reach the notification shade or icons near the top of my screen. To put it simply, you have to use this phone with both hands. On the bright side, the display is absolutely fantastic, and Android 5.0 does an awesome job of... Read more
Great phone for the price.  The Nexus 6 may be last years model, but it is fast and seems very well made.  I previously used a<br/>Samsung GS4 for 3 years, and the overall software may be a little more sophisticated on the GS models.  However, the newer Samsungs are $650+, and for what I do, this fits the bill.  I bought the phone for $261 used like new from Battery Assualt a third party seller, and am very pleased with the delivery speed and the build quality of the Motorola phone. The 6' screen take some adjusting to, but after a couple weeks, I am getting used to it.  I am pleased with the battery life as I can get 3 days of my normal use.  I turn it off at night, and that probably helps. At this price, I can upgrade in a year or two and not be out $600-$700.  If you are looking for a phone that is worth what it cost, then this is it.  I have nothing against the iphone or the other premium ones on the marked, but I like Android and the other $400 doesn't make the phone function any better.
I hated my AT&T; branded Samsung Galaxy S4. The last straw was AT&T; pushing out some compulsory news app that kept sending notifications to my Android Wear watch. The bloatware is out of control.<br/><br/>So far I love the Nexus 6. Everything just works. There is no bloat. I can uninstall any apps that I want. I was worried about the size, this is a big phone. It fits into my pocket just fine and the bigger screen is great for ebooks and graphic novels.<br/><br/>Possibly interesting to some people. I found the Samsung S4-Android 4.4 behavior annoying.<br/>Samsung S4-Android 4.4: music playing and headphones plugged in -> turn on car -> Bluetooth connects -> music plays through headphones -> turn off car -> music plays through headphones.<br/>Nexus 6-Android 5.1: music playing and headphones plugged in -> turn on car -> Bluetooth connects -> music plays through car speakers -> turn off car -> music plays through headphones.
This is a really nice phone.  I have Verizon.  I took the SIM from my current phone and used it on this phone.  No issues.  Activated and working.  My old phone data was migrated with no issues.  What I noticed is that the phone is set to preferred network type global.  When I changed this setting to either of the two other options my phone got confused and wouldn't connect to the Verizon network.  Keeping it on global it says LTE preferred which is what I want.  I turned off any roaming.  I spoke with Verizon on this issue and they said its fine there is no issue with having it set that way.  They also said if I do run into any issues I might consider coming in and having them give me a new SIM.  One other "feature" which I've read might be a carrier issue vs a phone feature is that when I have the hotspot running I cannot make or receive calls and surf at the same time.  So if I'm using the phone I cannot access the internet through my hotspot.
The phone itself is brilliant. Big beautiful screen, blazing processor and great camera. However be warned that this is NOT AN AUTHORIZED MOTOROLA RESELLER. If you buy this phone from Consumit Motorola WILL NOT COVER IT UNDER WARRANTY OR AT ALL.
It is was a little bigger and heavier than I expected but still fits in my shirt pocket (barely). After a few days I wondered why I lived with tiny phones in the past. You definably want to get a protective case for this. The screen is big, bright, clear with sharp colors.  I'm totally spoiled now.  The processor and memory are fast and responsive.  Multi-tasks like crazy. I didn't understand the task manager at first, I had all of the apps running at once with no preceptable performance problems.  The 64GB option is the smart way to go, since there is no SD expansion slot.<br/>Since it's a Google development platform it automatically gets all of the latest updates immediately.<br/>This is the Harley Davidson of smart phones.<br/>You will want the "Root Explorer" (Speed Software) and "VLC Media Player" (videolan.org) apps to get the full benefit out of this thing.
I am coming from a Moto X (2013) which has a 4.7 in. screen and this was a big jump for me. At first it was a little intimidating the screen size and the overall form factor of the phone, but after a few days of use, I have gotten use the phone and love it. I have had it since Saturday (4/4/15). It is a fast and smooth phone to use. What I like also is that not many people have it, especially in my group of friends.<br/><br/>The only problem I have is that the camera, while its good, I do wish it could be better in low light conditions, but its passable. The other problem I had with it (its more of my pet-peeve) is the Google Now Launcher that comes pre-installed with the phone. The beauty of android is that there are tuns of launcher options. I Just downloaded Apex Launcher and it has looked better. I don't like the big icons that come with Google Now Launcher.
Very nice screen and functionality. I bought this phone because my cell carrier was slowing my other phone's hotspot speed that I used to download media to my Nexus 7, seven inch tablet.  This phone is only one inch smaller than my tablet, and now I can download media straight to my phone using my unlimited data with my carrier.  Being that my new Nexus 6 is more like a mini tablet than a big phone, the media experience is just as good as using my small tablet. Plus the screen on the phone has better resolution than the tablet. Only issue I have is that the battery does not last like it does one my Oneplus one phone.  My Oneplus would last all day on a charge, but I have to recharge the Nexus 6 at least one or more times per day. The saving grace is that the phone has quick charging capability and charges fairly quickly using the supplied quick charger.
I don't get all the complaints over it being a big phone.  That's one of the selling points!  Surely you wouldn't buy an expensive phone like this without doing some basic research?  I knew exactly what I was getting before I ever ordered it.<br/><br/>Anyway, I love love LOVE my N6.  It's fast and responsive, and the massive screen is just gorgeous.  It came with an old developer build from pre-release, and I had some minor issues with it at first after running the necessary system updates (the microphone wouldn't work from Google keyboard for some odd reason, and Android Device Manager didn't work properly), but I reset it to factory settings and it's working perfectly now.<br/><br/>Great phone, highly recommended.  My one gripe is that I wish there were an SD card slot, but 64GB is still a good amount of storage.
My favorite phone ever.  Now I don't need to carry a phone and a tablet.  This is a large phone/tablet, but it is a Google product which means it has straight Android and gets the updates first.  I am switching to Google Fi for my phone company in January and this is one of the only phones that you can use on their system.<br/><br/>Takes really good photos, has strong sound, very clear phone reception and send (on Verizon).  Does work on Verizon by the way.  No problem and my phone bill dropped as I bought my own phone.<br/><br/>BIG ITEM is that this has wireless charging which Google dropped in their newest releases. Stupid . . . my wife and I will not buy any phone that doesn't have wireless charging.  So now I have this phone and another in reserve for when this one breaks.
Phone is perfect!!!! I love it. Pure android and it is project fi enabled now. Good Bye Verizon, hello to cheap phone bill.
This phone works great once you update to Marshmallow. Until I updated to Marshmallow, the battery life sucked horribly.
Fast, almost without ui glitches and bugs. Very good sound from sound speakers and the camera is really awesome.
Absolutely great phone. Some may not like the size of the huge screen but I personally love it. Display is great, battery life is pretty good (not the best, but not terrible) and the performance is quick and snappy. The only problem I have with it is that the screen gets this weird pinkish hue at lower brightness levels. Also, the phone comes with encryption enabled but unfortunately does not use hardware to do it.  So,  while the phone does perform well it doesn't perform to its maximum capability due to the extra strain on the processor from the encryption.  Otherwise though,  a great device that I would definitely recommend to those who aren't scared off by a bigger screen.
It's a lovely device and I use it as a backup phone when I come home. It is substantial in the hand but that really just makes me like the Nexus 6 even more. It's smooth and it has all the goodness of stock Android good or bad. The battery life is just OK, I expect this to be improved when Android M. Overall you can't go wrong with this device even with the Nexus 6P on his way out I feel like this is worth the price tag for what you are getting. I also enjoy the AMOLED screen on this device though it's a bit dim outside compared to my other phone. If you have the money and enjoy larger phones I say jump on it you won't even. Also I love wireless charging as well.
I bought a warehouse deal unit for a great price, and it arrived. The box was superficially damaged, which is to be expected with warehouse deal items. The phone itself was in perfect physical and working condition. I love the huge screen, and with the dual front facing speakers, make for the best media experience on any phone I've used. Battery life is pretty good, but not great. While there is no expandable memory, 64 GB plus Google's cloud storage make it unnecessary. The phone is very fast, and as usual with Nexus devices, free of any carrier branding or bloatware. I've had the phone about 6 months now, and still loving it.
I don't understand the negatives people are talking about.  This is a photo editing with unadulterated Google experience.  Answer yes anytime good wants access or permission for something and it reads your mind.  Without me asking it,  it reminded me my aunt to was flying in the next day.  In that morning it reminded me when to leave and that her flight was on time.  Halfway to the airport it told me it was delayed slightly.  The speakers are loud and sound great.  The display is insane.  It looks amazing and puts all other phones to shame.  I own an iPhone 6 plus as well (because my family and friends own them and are scared of change,  I use it to make things easier for them) but every time I use the iPhone I long for my nexus 6.  It is just hands down the better phone.  The only thing iPhone can do better is battery life.  That problem is solved on the nexus6 by using the built in wireless charging.
Even though it is a year old, this is a solid phone.  I have experienced no lag or performance impact and have been putting it through its paces.  This flagship phone can easily compete with a Note 5 and GS6 any day of the week, but for significantly less.  This is a great phone, especially for the price.  The only drawback may be the size.  It is very hard to operate the Nexus 6 with one hand, but I found it is very easy to hold and talking with the big form-factor is not an issue.<br/><br/>As a kicker, buying this from Amazon gets you a year of unlimited cloud storage.
Big screen. Big battery. Big sound. What's not to love? Works with Verizon and GSMs as well.
Great phone for the price! Timely updates, beautiful screen, great front facing speakers, decent camera, and speedy smooth experience. I see no reason for you to not buy it! The battery isn't as great as some options but android marshmallow has a few features to improve it including doze mode. Get it because M is about to release, you will get it first and it will improve an already great phone and fix it's only issue.<br/>THIS PHONE IS NOT TO BIG!! It felt nice in my hand and made viewing all media the best experience on a smart phone I have had thus far!
Perfect phone, bought off of Amazon warehouse with "minor damage" and it ended up being the box had no stickers on it. The phone worked great out of the box and had all accessories with it. Bought it just in time to have the Android Marshmallow 6.0 Update come any day. The phone had a nice weight and feel due to the aluminum body, the front facing speakers are amazing. The 6" 1440p screen is GORGEOUS! The only downsides that i see, is the lack of an IR blaster and no fingerprint sensor. For ~$300 this is the best phone you can buy brand new.
After the $300 price reduction, the Nexus 6 became a deal impossible to refuse. After my Asus Zenfone 2 stopped identifying touch input without having been dropped a single time spanning months, I was absolutely heart broken, forced to give up the Intel based phone @ 5.5" I had grown extremely fond of. The Nexus 6, through and through, however, is a better device across the board. Brighter screen, higher pixel density, more slender dimensions, much much better sound, improved photographic clarity. At this cost, the device is unmatched!
Very pleased!  I have a family of five and choose not to get upgrades through ATT in order to save money.  This means that we have to buy phones outright.  I bought two Nexus 6 phones to try out and they have been as good or better than our any of our iphones in the past.  We are still trying to figure out the music storage and ring tone capabilities, but haven't spent much time on doing this.  If these turn out to work as well as everything else then this phone is unbeatable, especially for the price. Future Christmas gifts...I think so.
Bit of background - Although I'm partial to Android I can appreciate the advantages of both apple and nexus product. I've had nexus phones from when Nexus One came out.<br/><br/>I like this phone but it doesn't 'wow' me. That said I had done my research and I got this phone because it's cross carrier compatibility. I wish Motorola mobile division wasn't sold off and this phone would be made in usa but it's made in china. Not really dinging it because of that but it doesn't help. The phone screen is big and that's good but any bigger and I would've gotten something else.<br/><br/>The reason I really had to knock off 2 stars is 'cause of Bluetooth issues. I started having issues from the get go after I got the 5.1 OTA update. I hadn't connected the headset before the update so I don't know if it would've made any difference. Third party apps can't be the culprit as I had the issue before installing any apps. The issues are related to signal strength and range. I've connected the same headset to multiple phone/tablet and the issues only appear when using with Nexus 6. I've tried the troubleshooting steps listed on various websites which is mainly clearing cache and data to no avail. With the phone being this big, bluetooth connectivity is crucial. I'm considering sending the phone back even though it means time spent to setup the device will have been wasted.<br/><br/>Update 5/5 - After a dropped call I ordered a replacement. The replacement fails to update to 5.0.1. It downloads the update, reboots, tries and fails. I see an android lying on its back with "Error" text over it. It then reboots and even after a factory restore fails to update. Thinking whether to replace or return. I chose to give it one more shot.
im a big guy so using this phone with one hand is not much of a problem. nexus 6 without case is same size as note 3 with a thin case, however i have outerbox which makes a phone much bigger but i still dont have issue using it one handed.<br/>Ive had nexus 6 for few months now and it is a good phone. its very fast and battery lasts whole day with light use. however it has a major sound and bluetooth issue. when i first got the phone, sound was great. my volume on speaker was always around 50%, few months later it is at 100% and it sounds low. i also use bluetooth a lot to listen to music and i am forced to restart my phone at least once every day due to bluetooth and sound. bceause of so many speakerphone and bluetooth issues i am considering switching back to my old phone.
Before I purchased this phone, I went to my local Verizon store. I asked them to bring out a new Nexus 6 and I verified a XT1103 model is the one they sell. I asked the associate if I purchased the phone on Amazon if they would activate it. The associate confirmed they would. I then purchased the phone on Amazon directly. When I took the phone to Verizon they activated it seamlessly. My online account for Verizon Wireless shows my device as "Nexus 6 non-vzw". Verizon users follow my format and you will be fine.
This is an awesome phone. Have had it for about a month now and I am totally impressed.  My other phone was a Galaxy note 2, which was good or still is but the nexus is far better. No more tons of bloatware running in the background.  The Nexus 6 runs very smooth no problems what so ever.  Activated on the Verizon network and everything is working great. If you are thinking about this phone get it you will not be disappointed.<br/>Great sound, super display, simple to use  Just do it, and get the Nexus 6
This thing is absolutely incredible. Brilliant screen, great battery life, and blazing fast performance. I have huge hands and this is the first phone I've found that doesn't feel like a toy. The price is perfect for this, especially considering that it's unlocked. I have it working on Verizon no problem. Just moved my old SIM from my HTC One M8 into this and gave Verizon a quick call to give them the new numbers. Had it up and running in about 10 minutes.
Awesome phone and an absolute steal for $350. I was just about to buy the Moto X pure edition 2015,  but when I read that the Nexus 6 was available for $100 less ($350 vs $450 for the 32 gig models of each).  I couldn't resist. The specs still hold up with today's flagships, and the fact that it runs Pure Android will keep it more up to date than most phones that are coming out right now. Also Amoled>LCD every time for me. Buy it while you still can.  👐👐👐
Bought this for my wife to use on Google's Project Fi. It is a large phone but an excellent one. It took about 5 minutes to get used to the the size. I bought a 64GB for myself and we both agree it they are great phones. The sale price was the deciding factor and its ships free with prime.  We just got our Fi invites last week and will be switching over from Verizon to Fi this coming week as soon as the new sims arrive.
Have been wanting a replacement for my nexus 5, but the pricing was too high for the N6. With the price drop due to the soon to be released Nexus 6 2015, I had to jump. For 399.00 with 64GB. What a steal. This is very large phablet. Not usable with one hand. I always use both hands anyway. Great sound, loud speakers, yes! Camera is improved, but still not as good as other brands. Great display too.
I immediately purchased the nexus 6 after getting a note 5 from my carrier. I hated the Note 5. THIS is pure Google Android. Smooth, fast and feels really well-constructed. Rooted this instantly after unpacking. LTE works flawlessly in Singapore,  which is where I live. No case, no screen protector, no problems. The screen  is not a fingerprint magnet. A super phone from Motorola!
This is the best phone in the world, you will always get the newest android release since this is Google branded device, is actually a hi end device, it works smoothly and flawless, pretty nice feature the fast charger, I never get out of juice when I'm out, I just need to connect my device for a few minutes and is ready to carry a few more hours. There is no downsize on it.
Great phone, works with Verizon 4G lte without having to contact Verizon. Just insert sim card and you're up and running in minutes. I had to trim my sim, so I bought a $7 sim card trimmer, which made it easy. The Bluetooth is fiddly and doesn't always connect to my car, though, and the screen is too dim in bright sunlight. Overall, however, I'm satisfied with the purchase.
It's a great phone. You won't regret buying. Not too big at all. Heard alot about issues with the camera but honestly its a great camera, even in low light. Battery life is great. You can easily get a full day of use with heavy use....even more if you play around with brightness etc. I'm a NEXUS fan.
I have had the Nexus 6 for about three weeks now and here are my thoughts...<br/><br/>The phone is big.  I don't have very long fingers, but despite that, I am not finding it all that much of a problem to use.  I really wasn't sure I would like the larger phablet.  My prior phone was the Nexus 5, which I loved, but it was getting a little long in the tooth.  I picked up the Nexus 6 during the recent discounting, and bought the 64gb version to get the additional space.  I was initially disappointed that it came with 5.0 android.  I quickly got updates bringing the phone to 5.1.1, which made be feel better, but I still missed Marshmallow, which I had on the Nexus 5.  After a few weeks the Marshmallow update finally made it to the Nexus 6 and now I am happy again.  Loving 6.0 on Nexus 6.<br/><br/>The hardware of the phone really seems good and solid. The curved back is slightly odd, but I think it probably does help with the bigger screen.  Some of the most obvious good points start with the battery.  I'm am floored by the battery life with this phone.  It sometimes says four days left on battery.  After a full day of normal use, it usually makes it down to 70 or 80% of full.  The charging time is stellar; it doesn't seem to take 15 or 20 minutes for me to top it off.  After watching a video on the phone it was predicting another 17 of video hours left based on the trend.<br/><br/>The camera takes some amazing resolution pictures... and makes big files as one might expect.  I've already gotten some amazing pictures and the zoom-in capability is stunning.<br/><br/>I am on the T-Mobile network and WiFi Calling is a great new feature I've already used.  It works far smoother than Skype and solves a signal problem I have at one of my locations.  I wasn't even aware the phone had support for it, but now I am, and quite happy with it, and it was so simple to enable it.  So easy to use.<br/><br/>I've had not problems with the phone, and at the discounted price I am very satisfied.  I wasn't willing to go with the original price, but halving the price made this phone an easy choice, I have definitely not regretted.
As someone who came over to the Nexus 6 from the Samsung Galaxy S4 (and, prior to that, the Galaxy S3), here are my initial impressions after having the phone for about a day:<br/><br/>The size:<br/><br/>This phone is big and heavy. I expected, and wanted, it to be big. However, I did not realize just how heavy it would be. A coworker has a Galaxy Note that is about the same size, but seems to weigh not even half of what this phone does. One problem I've come across with the big screen involves widgets. I used to have a 4x2 clock/temperature/weather/date widget through Fancy Widgets that I really liked, which fit perfectly centered on the Galaxy S-series phones. However, on this phone it did not, and there was no option for a wider widget, so I ended up having to install Beautiful Widgets, which has a 5x2 widget that worked out (though BW skins are not as aesthetically pleasing and the widget additional features are not as customizable as Fancy Widgets). I bought the "Supcase" frosted case to protect my phone, and it does add some bulk, but even without the case the phone still seems a little too chunky to be practical (even though I rarely use it to make phone calls). I'm told I'll get used to it and never be able to go back to anything smaller, though, so we'll see.<br/><br/>Setup:<br/><br/>This was the easiest set-up I've ever done. The phone walks you through set-up, and gives you the option to use NFC to transfer all of the data from your old phone onto the new one. It might have been wishful thinking on my part, but I'd hoped this would mean not only transferring the apps themselves, but the information from within the apps, my wallpaper, pictures, etc. Nope. It did transfer all of my Google stuff, and automatically downloaded all of the apps from the Play Store, but I still had to login to all of the accounts and, in the case of some (e.g., my Checkbook app, which is basically a digital check register), re-enter all of my data. None of my wallpapers or widgets or other customizations transferred over. Most of my personalized stuff from the Galaxy S4 was stored on an SD card, rather than on the device's internal memory, so maybe that might explain why it didn't sync to the extent I'd hoped. Regardless, the NFC transfer is an awesome feature and no doubt saved me a lot of time. A tip I learned from reading other reviews: Leave the SIM card out during set-up and connect to the internet via WiFi instead, and let the phone do all of its updating (including if it is updating from Android OS 5.0 to 5.1) before even thinking of inserting the SIM. There were some horror stories of people who followed set-up instructions to put the SIM card in first, only to end up with the carrier using that as a vehicle to carrier-lock the phone and add bloatware. I don't know if this would have happened had I inserted my SIM card first, but figured "why risk it?" Also good to know: If you're on a carrier that uses SIM cards, it's unlikely your current SIM card will work in this device, as it uses a nano SIM card, which is a relatively new thing in the Android world. Most likely, you've currently got a micro SIM card, and will need to contact your carrier and buy/order a new SIM card. There are internet tutorials on cutting a micro SIM card down to nano SIM card size and then filing/sanding it down to nano card thickness, but that's just way too involved and risky. . . better to just go get a new nano SIM card.<br/><br/>The camera:<br/><br/>I've only taken a couple of pictures, in well-lit places, and they look decent, but I feel like the Galaxy S4 takes crisper, more vibrant photos and has a more intuitive camera app. Maybe I'll just need to start using a third-party camera app.<br/><br/>Motorola/Android Lollipop vs. Samsung Galaxy S4/Touch Whiz/Android Jelly Bean:<br/><br/>This phone seems to process things noticeably faster than the Galaxy S4, but that could also have to do with that most of the things on my S4 were on an SD card, whereas everything I use on the Nexus 6 is more readily available on the internal phone memory. I was not a fan of the ambient notifications, so I turned those off. I could not stand the big, white, ugly Google search bar at the top of the screen. The Google launcher does not allow you to remove it, or even move or resize it. The placement of it at the very top of the screen doesn't make any sense from a user standpoint. Maybe that's just where they thought it would be least intrusive. I had to install Nova Launcher in order to get rid of the Google search bar, and to get back some of the functionality I lost in switching from Samsung to Motorola. And, speaking of the user-unfriendly placement of the Google search bar, the "power" and "volume" button placement likewise do not make sense. The power button and volume buttons are on the right side of the phone, halfway down the phone. This doesn't make sense, as the majority of people are right-handed, and given that most people grip a phone from the middle rather than the bottom or the top. The buttons are in the way when you're trying to hold the phone, and hard to get at when you're actually in a call and need to turn the volume up or down. I'm put off that there is no quick and easy way to switch from silent to vibrate to sound, and access other commonly used features that were oh-so-accessible when you pulled down the menu on the Galaxy. On the Nexus, you have to go to the app drawer, then scroll down to "settings," then go to "sound & notification," and then individually control the volume of media, alarms, and ring volume from there. Speaking of "settings," I noticed there are much fewer options available on the Nexus than on the Galaxy series. Everyone talks about getting the super customizable "pure Android" experience, but with this device I feel like my hands are tied in a lot of respects. And, as far as the "no bloatware" claim, nothing could be further from the truth: Google pre-installed a bunch of their own apps (Drive, Hangouts, Play Games, Play Newsstand, Play Music, Play Books, Slides, Keep, Google Photos (which requires also having a Google + account-- no thanks!), etc.) and you can't uninstall them. The best you can do is disable the app, uninstall any updates to it (e.g., bring it back to the factory version, which is usually slightly smaller in file size), and "disable" the app. . . but it still exists on the phone, taking up valuable internal memory space on a phone that doesn't have any option for SD card expansion.<br/><br/>I think someone coming over to the Nexus 6 from the Moto X would be really happy since it's basically the Moto X except bigger and better. But coming over from the Samsung Galaxy series, I'm not very impressed. As it stands right now, this phone is 3 stars (just "okay"), but for the price (on sale on Amazon to make way for the Nexus 6p) and the fact that it is unlocked and one of the few phones that work with the new Google Fi network (which I haven't switched to. . . yet) and will get updates before many other phones do, I feel like it is a very good deal and worth the money. I also feel like I shouldn't rush to judgment until I've had more time to acclimate to it, and I think it does have potential if I can figure out how to better customize it (without rooting it and voiding the warranty, and without having to install a bunch of third party work-around apps), so I am bumping up to four stars.
I decided to sign up ProjectFi and my Note 2 wasn't going to be able to carry over, so I decided to get the 64GB Nexus 6 while it was on the deal of the day (convenient timing!). I have owned the phone now for almost 2 months and decided that I have had an appropriate amount of time to formulate an appropriate review.<br/><br/>[Physical Phone]<br/>:: SIZE :: The phone itself is slightly larger than my old Note 2 - both in size and screen. So far I have barely even noticed that it is slightly larger to my happy surprise. I recently took it on a hot air balloon ride tour and had no problem hanging it over the side and taking pictures. The weight and size feels like a perfect fit for my hand.<br/>:: SOUND :: This is one of the best, and smartest, features about this phone. It has two FRONT facing speakers. The reason for the emphasis on the front facing part is because most phones have the speakers facing the rear. Not only do you lose sound value from the phone, but you don't get a sense of immersion. This has been fixed with this phone. The dual front facing speakers give the feeling of surround sound, which is great when you are watching a movie on your phone. This also helps when you are using the phone as a speaker phone, because the sound comes through much greater and clearer.<br/><br/>:: CAMERA :: This is both great and bad. The great part is the rear facing camera. It has a decent megapixel rating (12), performs pretty good in most lighting situations, and the video records in 4K, which is surprising and very clear. The bad part is the front facing camera - this also felt like an after thought. Flesh tones seem off and the camera tends to shoot grainy or blurry. Personally I hate selfies, so this doesn't really affect me much.<br/><br/>:: SCREEN :: This was the biggest disappoint. The screen in a regular setting is beautiful - very crisp and clear and the color contrast is absolutely amazing. The huge con of this is when you start getting glare from the sun. The screen becomes almost unviewable, which in this day and age is unacceptable.<br/><br/>[Phone Performance]<br/>:: PROCESSING :: The phone really performs here. Programs open up almost seamlessly and I have not noticed any stuttering or slowdowns when playing really graphically intense games.<br/><br/>:: BATTERY :: I do not like the fact that the new age phones do not allow you to physically swap the battery, because I only imagine headaches down the road when the battery ultimately fails, but the battery that is included in pretty decent. Seems like I can watch movies and/or play games pretty intensely for several hours straight without any worries.<br/><br/>Overall I would say this was a very good phone released by Motorola, which some glaring (pun intended) mistakes.<br/><br/>Overall: 4.0/5.0
Reception and Call Quality - 10/10<br/>The Call Quality and the reception received is superb with no problems whatever. It works for CDMA and GSM Networks a truly Global Phone coming unlocked out of the box.<br/><br/>Display 9/10<br/>5.96 Quad HD display, colors are so vivid and high brightness setting is very good for outdoors. This is a great big screen for reading and watching movies, but Its also not the latest Gorilla Glass 4 and although its Amoled its not Super-Amoled; coming from Samsung I see a huge difference in the technology.<br/><br/>Battery Life 9/10<br/>Turbo charge seriously works in just 1.5 hours. The battery usually last for a day with moderate use so no big complaints here. It would be great if it was a replaceable battery.<br/><br/>Camera 5/10<br/>In day light its a great camera with gorgeous colors and very good quality overall, but at low light its pretty much unusable. So if your really into the camera this isn't the phone for you especially for night shots, don't even think about it. And this is the main reason why I give it a 4 out of 5 score for this review.<br/><br/>Ease of Use 10/10<br/>Very easy to use with Stock Android, no bloatware means a fast and trouble free android experience.<br/><br/>Design and form factor 10/10<br/>This doesn't feel very plastic at all, its some premium material makes it feel really high end than a lot of phones. The curve back is great idea, shocking even though its a big phone you are able to use one hand because of that curved backed. The greatest design is the two front firing speakers which is probably the loudest and clearest sounds coming out in any smartphone at the moment.<br/><br/>Portability (size / weight) 10/10<br/>Very slim in size at 10mm and able to fit in my pockets with a comfortable curved back. Also I loved how the weight is in the heavier side of 184 grams, makes it feel premium; I say its the prefect weight for a phone this size.<br/><br/>Value 10/10<br/>Was it worth it when it was released... i don't think so. But today after a year being priced at $350 from its released price of $650, its worth every single penny. For this price you're really getting an outstanding phone that you cannot go wrong with. I find it to be a better value than the new Nexus 6P if you really don't care about the Camera.
When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. I went into Verizon Wireless to buy the only version they sell (32 gb Midnight Blue for $649.99 off contract). Thank God they didn't have it in stock! I came home and was about to purchase it from Google but decided to check Amazon first. I couldn't believe they were selling the official US version for $399.99 for the 64 GB White model. I immediately made the purchase and for an extra $10 was able to have same day delivery. So I ended up receiving it today around 5:00. I can confirm that it is in fact that US edition (just make sure you buy directly from Amazon. Don't risk 3rd party sellers or they might send you the international edition and that doesn't work on US LTE bands.) So after about 5 updates, I had Marshmallow on my Nexus 6. Coming from a G3, I can tell you it blows any phone I've ever owned out of the water. The speaker quality is LOUD and CLEAR. Call quality is 10/10. I felt like I was talking on a land line. My buddy said I sounded a lot clearer and we must have had a 45 minute conversation. The phone didn't heat up one bit. Apps open IMMEDIATELY! Even memory hogs like Facebook produce no delay. The bread and butter of this phone is the Quad HD AMOLED display. It's beautiful! I turn the brightness up all the way so I can fully enjoy it. Haven't tested the camera yet but from what I've read, it's more the decent. I went into Verizon and had absolutely no problem with activation.It took 5 minutes. They entered my IMEI into their computer, put the SIM card in and I was good to go. LTE is lightening fast. Indoors I'm getting roughly 60 mbps/download. I couldn't be happier with this phone. Jump on this deal now because I don't see this phone dropping in price for at least a couple years. $400 is a steal! Thank you, Amazon!  I see myself with this phone for at least 2 years! And you saved me $250 for getting the ugly 32 gb Verizon model!
I could not be happier with a phone purchase. Outstanding phone! Arrived today and set up was a breeze. Of course it took about 2 hours through all the updates, reboots, etc. Yes, it is a 6 inch phone. It fits my hands and the weight is no strain. Beautiful dark blue casing...very premium feel. This phone is fast! I had an extra T-Mobile Nano sim to use and the set up with T-Mo was fast and easy. I looked on the T-Mo forums and Amazon/Google user posts and reviews before buying and I do agree with one hardware complaint, the phone gets warm, but not uncomfortably for me. The other big issue, resolved only recently it seems,  is Wi-Fi calling on T-Mo...with the last update, Wi-Fi calling is finally working. Other items to note, the first picture I took after the setup was of our garden and it was spectacular. Both sending and receiving call quality is excellent.  I've had the T-Mo G1, MyTouch, Nexus 4, Nexus 5, Lumia 925, and now the Nexus 6 (No IPhones ever...PLEASE!). I'm waiting for the Lumia 950/950xl (folks, try a windows phone, they don't have as many apps but they are functional and fun as all get out), but in the meantime, the Nexus 6 will do nicely. And the price? I waited almost a year but it was worth it. At $699, no way Jose, but at $399, Yowza!<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Premium feel<br/>Premium look, Midnight blue smooth back, Aluminium dark silver blue sides<br/>Fast initial setup<br/>Fast T-Mo set up<br/>Excellent Back Facing Camera<br/>Sharp, Bright display.<br/>6 Inch Size<br/>Fast processor.<br/>Fast internet. Web pages loaded quickly<br/>Wi-Fi calling is working with the last T-Mo update<br/>Fast Charging<br/>Latest (Sep 2015) pure Android OS build (5.1.1)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Does get warm while charging
<br/><br/><br/>SUMMARY: Yes, its a big phone. But its untouched android experience make it a strong daily performer. Go try it hands-on in a store near you to get a feel for its size before you buy it. It gives you the freedom of going with any carrier which is a big plus.<br/><br/>Some of my observations that throw light on day-to-day usage experience/quirks are below:<br/><br/>PERFORMANCE: I switched from a Note 4 mainly due to the sluggish nature of Samsung TouchWiz. Compared to that, the-now-one-year-old Nexus 6, runs like a breeze. No more waiting for the graphics/animations to catch up like my Note 4. Everything just works out of the box! Of course, you lose some features like the S-pen - but that is something I could live without in exchange for a zippy fast Android phone like Nexus 6. FIVE stars here!<br/><br/>AMOLED DISPLAY: The screen is gorgeous. It may seem to boost up colors more than normal, but that should be OK for most folks. I love the way Nexus 6 flashes the notification summary and the clock when you move or pick up the phone from a stand still. 5 STARS.<br/><br/>BATTERY LIFE: After using it for a week (moderate usage - work / personal emails, 50 messages, 10-15 calls averaging 4min each, about 30 minutes of browsing, 15 minutes of youtube, 40 minutes of bluetooth music), I would end up with ~30% battery by end of the day after work. This would take me up to bed time when I would charge it for the night. While the 3220mAh battery is not a stellar performer, it gets that job done for me. 3.5 STARS.<br/><br/>SIZE: This phone can seem like a behemoth depending on where you are coming from.. For me, it was just a little bigger than my Note 4. So, I got used to it easily. I do like the huge 6" screen. It is very useful while watching videos and gaming. I am also able to see more content on emails without the need for scrolling, which is a big plus that I didn't see mentioned in many reviews. Now, the downside of this phone is not the size but the material that makes up the back - IT IS VERY SLIPPERY. I find myself using this phone one-handed many times. For this, I have to use the phone's weight to balance it on my 4 fingers leaving my thumb to operate the phone. And depending on the area of screen I want to reach with my thumb, I will have to re-position my palm to give me that extra reach. So, if you are holding this phone at an angle, it will slip out of your four finger hold very easily. I wish the backing material had a little more grip to it. BUT, I can see people getting used to this gripping technique over a few weeks. 4 STARS.<br/><br/>BUTTON PLACEMENT: The screen lock/power and volume controls are on the right side and placed towards the top half of the phone. What this stops you from doing is to hold the phone in landscape mode on one hand with your thumb supporting the side that has these buttons. Due to the one-hand grip, I have ended up touching these buttons numerous times when I didn't intend to.. this is a little annoying at times, but you do get used to it. The buttons are very tactile and you do feel when you press it. 3 STARS.<br/><br/>CURVED BACK: This makes the phone not stay put on a flat surface. Its very tough to operate with one finger when your huge Nexus 6 is rotating around like crazy. Only way around this is to hold the phone with some other fingers while trying to touch/type. 2 STARS.<br/><br/>DUAL FRONT FACING SPEAKERS: These make a world of a difference compared to the single back-facing speaker of Note 4. The sound is just booming at 60% volume and its enjoyable! 5 STARS.
SHORT VERSION:<br/>The Motorola nexus 6 is a great phone powered by the qualcomm snapdragon 805@2.7 GHZ with 3GB of RAM which makes it a beast of a phone that runs stock android with no lag, butter smooth and everything you would expect from a high end smartphone.<br/><br/>LONG VERSION:<br/>I have had the Google nexus 6 for almost 2 months now and its a great phone, it has awesome specs and it runs stock android butter smooth no lag nothing.<br/><br/>Its a great powerful phone for those people that want to play graphically intensive games daily bases like me and listen to music and streaming, watching YouTube videos all the time.<br/><br/>The dual front facing speakers on the nexus 6 sound awesome and great but in my unit though I had a volume issue where the speakers would go very low so I sent it back to Motorola and they replaced it with another nexus 6 that dowes not have these issues.<br/><br/>In terms of battery life there is not much to say because with the nexus 6 I am a heavy user like I said at the beginning of this review and I am a heavy user so I have to plug my nexus 6 in to charge twice a day with the included Motorola turbo charger which charges the phone very fast i would say in about 1 hour from 10 to 100% there is an estimated time at the bottom of the screen hen you plug it in it gives you an estimated time until it is fully charged on AC.<br/><br/>In therms of battery life I can get up to 4 and a half hours of on screen time out of this phone so if you are a heavy user just keep in mind that you have to charge this phone twice a day.<br/>Speaking of LTE and 4G the nexus 6 provides great LTE Speads on my particular carriars AT& and T-mobile and also Oraneg Jordan.<br/><br/>Now there are two versions of this phone there is the XT1100 which is the international version and the XT1103 which is the US Version. Both versions have identical and the same specs but the XT1100 Does not pickup 3G or LTE on the US Networks.<br/><br/>For your reference, these are the compatible networks for the two versions of the phone:<br/><br/>XT1103 (Model 00630NARTL) :<br/>GSM: 850/900/1800/1900 MHz<br/>CDMA band class: 0/1/10<br/>WCDMA bands: 1/2/4/5/8<br/>LTE bands: 2/3/4/5/7/12/13/17/25/26/29/41<br/>CA DL bands: B2-B13, B2-B17, B2-29, B4-B5, B4-B13, B4-B17, B4-B29<br/><br/>XT1100 (Model SM4034AW4N3)<br/>GSM: 850/900/1800/1900 MHz<br/>WCDMA bands: 1/2/4/5/6/8/9/19<br/>LTE bands: 1/3/5/7/8/9/19/20/28/41<br/>CA DL bands: B3-B5, B3-B8
I really don't know what to say, other than it is a Nexus. For those of you looking to tinker with solid hardware, fastest google updates and the most developer support I don't need to explain to you this is the phone to get. Hardware wise it has some of the best specs around, even for being nearly 7-8 months old at this point there is really nothing out there that rivals it just yet, at least in my opinion. The 6in screen size is intimidating to some people, and I can say for me at the beginning I didn't know if I would like that, it seemed big. Having it now, I know I could never go back to anything else much smaller. I picked up my wifes iphone 6 and was disappointed on how small it was and can't see myself with something that small. Even my phone before was the Moto X 2014 edition and that seemed small in comparison even though it was only .8in smaller. The camera takes great pictures, and the software, well is the way Android should be, no skins and what every android should have. Some complain about battery life and I would like to know what some of them are doing, as I consistently get 3-4 hours screen on time and run through a day from 530am to 1am the next day not needing charging. I know some issues were involved with older version of android but this runs the latest 5.1.1 and also has the M preview from the next version of android available. I have tested Android M and I do have to say we are in for a treat. It is more robust, smoother, stable, and battery sipping. And for those not afraid to tinker, the dev community is the biggest for the nexus line, and the custom options make this phone to be better than how it ships. I highly recommend  this phone, this is the OS that google envisioned, and the device to run it, you can't get any better than that.
I have been a fan of Google's open-source operating system Android for years now. Though I can't say I've been entirely pleased with the experience the entire time. Google had a few rough spots in the Android 2.2 'Froyo' and 3.x 'Honeycomb' eras, and while those were some difficult times to be an Android fan, many fans such as myself stuck it out because they saw the potential Android had. Fast forward to 2014, and I believe that Google and their talented team of developers and engineers have finally realized the potential that Android has had all these years. Android 5.0 Lollipop is a beautiful and elegant looking operating system with buttery smooth animations, bright and colorful imagery to please the eye, and a plethora of new features and services to make sure the user experience is as enjoyable as possible. Combine that with the engineering of Motorola, the phone's hardware manufacturer, and you get great hardware to run the great software provided by Google. Inspired by Motorola's previous flagship phone the Moto X, the Nexus 6 improves upon that phone's design, including dual front facing speakers and a QHD display for an amazing audio/visual experience, metal frame and curved soft touch back for a great feel in the hand, and powerful internals to keep the phone running smooth and consistently. Be warned, though, a 5.96" screen is nothing to sneeze at. This phone is LARGE, and while that may deter some, I believe it just adds to the value.Many current flagship phones can boast the same specifications and design aesthetics, but no phone can appeal to developers and consumers alike like the Nexus line can. Designed with developers in mind, the Nexus 6 has no restrictions on what you can do with the phone, and it can be modified to your heart's content. This is what really sets the Nexus line of phones apart, as they are the first phones to receive updates from Google, and their community development support is rivaled by none. This is what has made people purchase Nexus phones in the past. This time, Google has made a truly premium handset that anyone can enjoy, not just developers. If you want a premium phone that will be supported for a long time and will handle just about anything you can throw at it, the Nexus 6 is the way to go.
I already know for sure it will be replacing my N10 for tablet functionality. That thing is just too big too lug around in a fanny pack. The N6 screen is big enough to handle any of the apps I was using on the N10. In hindsight I maybe should have ordered the white model. Since it will be sitting close to me on my bucket seat/table it will get hot sitting in the sun. With the white one I could flip it over screen side down and reduce solar gain. It does come with turbo charger and it does get warm when charging. Booting it up and configuring it was simple and straightforward. It even has a 'tap-and-go' feature. IE: Fire up your old android device - tap them together - and all the app's and configuration settings are ported over to the new device - via NFC. As part of the initialization process it updated the operating system to 5.1 - which offers some nice incremental improvements for maps, drive, files & photos. The OLED screen is absolutely gorgeous! Photos I've taken with my Canon G7X look even better on this device than the N10 - and of course way better than my Chromebook - with it's fairly crappy screen. As an Ebook reader it's far more useful than the N10 - again - just the right size. I have never owned a smartphone or Ipod type music player. Last year I ripped all my cd's to mp3's and saved them on a thumb drive and google drive and google music. Now - for the first time ever - I can plug in a pair of lightweight earphones, put the N6 in my pocket - and play back my music while walking around doing chores or whatever - and of course Pandora music as well - a very liberating experience! Netflix fired up no problem and plays back really well - assuming you have a decent internet connection. And again - the display is gorgeous - has almost a three dimensional aspect to it. The wifi radio is working better than either my N10 or Chromebook - 5 bars vs 4 bars. All the Google app's are running quick and snappy - no bugs - no glitches - no I gotcha's... I believe Google is migrating it's Voice app into the Project Fi domain. IE: Google Voice goes away if you opt for Project Fi - most of the functionality is incorporated into Hangouts and the N6 Phone app. I think Google plus is also going away - they're already migrating the photos app over to drive. No love lost for the demise of Google Plus. Google doesn't always get everything right the first time but they do keep working continuously to improve the software. I think they're making good progress on most fronts! I highly recommend the 64gb version - for $50 more it's well worth it! Thankfully - gone are the days when smartphone/tablet vendors charged $10/gb of flash memory! I ordered the $40 case along with the phone - I think it's only worth about three dollars though :-( Audio output via speakers is decent - won't blow you away - but decent. Same goes for headphone audio out - maybe slightly better but depends on the quality of ear/head phones.
Got this on the Amazon Lightning deal for a great price.  I "upgraded" from a LG G3.  I put upgraded in quotation marks because I find both phones have their positives and negatives.  This phone is now old in technology terms so I am not going to rehash specs, spew data, etc.  I am gonna make my review simple on my likes and dislikes when comparing it to the LG G3.<br/><br/>Here are my observations by a normal phone user.<br/><br/>1. The Nexus 6 is large, but still very comfortable to hold<br/>2. The curved screen of the Nexus 6 makes finding a good Tempered Glass Screen Protector impossible.<br/>3.  The Nexus 6 does NOT have LED notifications, you have to root and install an app to get LED notifications.<br/>4. The Ambient Display option is glitchy and causes you to pocket dial unless you password protect your phone.<br/>5.  There is no tap to wake feature as there is on the LG G3, again unless your root.<br/>6.  There is no visual voicemail so you have to revert back to calling your voicemail box or downloading glitchy apps.<br/>7.  The AMOLED screen is extremely nice and I do not see a difference in quality between the LG G3 vs the 6<br/>8.  I love the front speaker design, makes all sounds seem more pleasurable then the rear facing speakers on the G3<br/>9.  Camera quality is much improved if you turn on the HDR+ feature of your camera. Shutter time increases but so does quality.<br/>10.  Love the turbo charge ability on the nexus 6<br/>11.  There is no gallery for your pictures, google expects you to use Google Photos.  I now use Quickpick<br/>12.  I hate that there is no way to exit google chrome browser, so I use CM Browser which allows exit and also is lightweight and secure.
I love this phone.  It has a great screen and wonderful voice recognition.  I bought it unlocked through Amazon, then ordered a sim card online through Verizon.  I installed the sim card myself and everything worked without problems.  This is my favorite phone.
I purchased the Nexus 6 after having continued issues with my Samsung Note (1). My Note had reached its limit. I am on T-Mobile and was having constant dropped calls, lost connections, etc. And I blame the phone more than I do the service provider. It was old, the USB charging had been replaced, and most of my issues started after that (I think the repair tech may have damaged the antenna).<br/><br/>I've been using the Nexus 6 for about three days. Lightning fast compared to the Note. A little faster than the Blackberry Passport I use for work (which is a great business phone in my opinion).<br/><br/>It really works well the streaming data. And it makes calls and picks up signal better than the Note. I don't drop calls any more.<br/><br/>It holds a charge well, but I do find myself charging when I get home from work. But with the super fast charging, it's really no big deal. Plug it in before dinner and it's got a nice bump in battery level after the dishes are done. While charging, the unit does tend to get very warm. I haven't seen the bulging back that has been mentioned elsewhere, though.<br/><br/>The camera is decent enough. Like the front camera for video chats. Pictures are decent but the interface is a little clunky. I just have to get used to it.<br/><br/>I love the fact that this did not contain any bloatware as delivered. So nice to be able to manage what I want on it.<br/><br/>In general, I really love this device. I'm probably a low-end user. I don't play a ton of games or watch movies/TV on it. I just wanted something that would make good calls, give me fast browsing, and access to the latest stuff. And it delivers.
I went from a potato to this phone. Holy crap. Such an impovement. Lots of ram, quad core cpu. Fantastic. even comes with its turbo charger. Only weird thing is how long it takes for it to load.<br/><br/>NOTE: This phone WILL work for tracfones BYOP program!
The phone itself is fantastic. There are a few issues with Android 5.1.1 (most notably trying to tweak the Priority and Interruption settings for notifications), but I love the feel and the size of the Nexus 6. Definitely wouldn't regret this purchase.
I've had it for a week now and I'm very satisfied with it.  Coming from a Nexus 5 and Nexus 4, I decided to pass when Nexus 6 was released on 2014. The main reason was it's size and the high price, and the fact that I was expecting a new version of Nexus 5. Now that Nexus 5x  was presented I was a bit disappointed with the specs for a 2015 Nexus, so after giving it a good thought I decided to buy the Nexus 6 at a great price and with very decent specs even now on 2015.<br/>The good:<br/>*Great price<br/>*Diaplay. I'm not a big fan of Amoled, but it just looks beautiful.<br/>*Size. Yes it's big, but you get used to the size very quickly, and after a couple of days you will love it. It fits perfectly in my pocket, doesn't feel heavy.<br/>*Storage. 32 Gb is good enough for me. That should be the minimum standard for 2015, can't believe 5x starts at 16 Gb<br/>*Sound. Simply superb.<br/>*It's a Nexus. Meaning pure Android  experience and the latest version available right now and constant updates for at least one more year.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/>WiFi issue. II had some trouble connecting to my router. It kept disconnecting. Sometimes it worked after resetting dsl modem or after restarting the phone. I ended up changing some setting in the router (band selection to auto) and that did the trick apparently. I'll update in case the issue persists.<br/><br/>Tip: Skip all the OTA updates and flash Android M factory image right away. It will save you time and you will have a fresh start with the latest Android.
This has been a great phone from day one. Initially I was little skeptical about the features available in this model when compared to my HTC One M7, but it took only a few hours to fiddle around with the stock Lollipop OS and soon I was very comfortable with what the phone had to offer. Many people have stated the size of the phone as being a big concern, but this has bothered me the least. The phone feels really great while holding it and I do manage some one hand operations (though some need you to use two hands) in most daily use situations. The immersive 5.9 inch QHD display is a big plus to the phone and viewing videos or photos is a charm!<br/><br/>The battery life comes to a day of moderate usage even with the 5.1 update and I have no problem whatsoever with the performance this phone delivers, it is fluid and seamless across all the applications. Didn't like the stock Android launcher on the phone and I now use Nova Launcher to add more customization on the phone (one of the things I hated with the Google Now launcher was the white color App drawer).<br/><br/>The camera on the phone takes some time to focus and is not always accurate in low light. I am still looking for an App which can improve the camera to focus better and quicker.<br/><br/>Overall, really pleased with the ownership of this device for over a month now and would recommend for anyone looking to enjoy the stock android experience without all that bloatware from manufacturers.
-PROS-<br/>I've always been a huge fan of Google's phones so I had high expectations for this product. The first thing I loved about this phone was the overall exterior design. I'm usually not a big fan of giant logos on phones, but motorola pulls it off beautifully. The screen itself is quite nice and large, not to mention extremely colorful. As with most motorola phones, the screen is more saturated than a typical smart phone leading to the intensification of colors which is simply beautiful. As of now, the phone has Android Lollipop. I have no complaints about Android. It's in my opinion the most gorgeous and functional mobile OS out there. The camera is pretty good...for the most part (see cons).<br/><br/>-CONS-<br/>Camera doesn't work well in low lighting. At all. I went from an LG G3 to a Nexus 6, yet to me the G3's camera is vastly superior in darker settings. For some reason, on all motorola phones that I've tested this on, Snapchat is extremely laggy and crashes frequently. I imagine that most people wouldn't actually care about that anyway, but I'm just giving you heads up. The battery life is...so-so. It lasts me through a 5 hour school day followed by a 5 hour work shift, but with minimal usage. It of course all depends on what you're using the phone for!<br/><br/>-SUMMARY-<br/>Amazing design inside and out, great display, native android (a HUGE plus for me!). Decent camera (though not in a low lighting), mediocre battery life.
I have a xperia z ultra 6.44 inch phone which served me well until the charging/micro USB port quit charging the phone. I then bought a 5.5 inch oneplus one phone, which is fantastic, but wanted big. I mean really big, this nexus 6 is big, but I still may get a p8 max. There is nothing I can say bad about the nexus 6, I ran Atutu benchmarks and my oneplus one and the nexus 6 were pretty much identical, if I can remember right both scored around 49500-50000. Size wise, even though the nexus 6 is bigger, its not that much bigger than the oneplus one. The nexus 6 Qhd screen is very nice, Qhd videos on YouTube almost look 3D. The nexus 6 speakers sound very good and are in stereo which is a rare thing in phones now and have no distortion at full volume. Touch smoothness seems to be the best of any phone I have had when playing games. One crazy good feature is you can select what notifications you want which is beyond great. I am the on call person at work, I can turn off everything except phone calls so I don't get woke up when receiving a email etc, it also let's you pick if you want only certain contacts to be able to get through. Battery life is adequate and on par with phone this size, but the quick charge makes this better since I can use the phone all night and quick charge it for a 1/2 hour and get through the rest of the day. Only reason I wouldn't keep it, is size. I like Huge phones, more like tablets, just a personal preference. Update: I have had the Nexus 6 now long enough to really use the phone and I am very happy with it. I have never had a freeze up or shut down for no reason issue, that pretty much all my Android phones in past have had. Being a Nexus, is odd its 11/18 today and I still don't have the Marshmallow update. I'm trying to think of any bad points to this phone, but is very hard to find faults. Only bad thing I can think of, is when battery gets low, below 15% warning, there is a point where phone just shuts off, no warning after the 15% before it shuts down. So a few times it shut off on me and once back on a charger can take up to 15 minutes before phone will be able to come back on. At first I wanted huge, this phone is growing on me and the 6 inch screen size is nice, fits in my shirt pocket and takes great pictures.
After 40 days of use, half of the screen went blank and unresponsive, did the Hard Reset option and the problem was still there, called Motorola (1 Year Warranty) but since amazon.com is not an authorized Motorola dealer they denied to repair or replace my Nexus 6, So I just Lost $400.00...
I LOVE this phone my first venture into the nexus world and loving stock android .... and the hardware just makes it even better... lag is pretty much non existent and thankfully my hand are big so size is not an issue ...
Fantastic device, unbeatable price for what you get almost a year after release. Looking forward to being able to use this device for years to come as it's a beast and has tons of value.
There are enough reviews of this phone already out there and on here. Though I'll have to say I will NEVER buy another phone without front facing stereo speakers. THESE SPEAKERS ARE STUNNING especially if you are used to cupping your hand behind your phone to watch - and hear - a video!  Stereo separation even works amazingly well.<br/><br/>Mainly though I just want to confirm that I did receive the XT1103 model in the 64GB blue. It said "Ships from and sold by Amazon" so pay attention.<br/><br/>Also oddly, I ordered at 1am Tuesday morning (ok, ok, 1am Monday night) and it arrived 4pm Weds - with the free shipping option!  I'm sure it's just warehouse luck + UPS luck that I got it so fast, but still ... that's like wow impressive.<br/><br/>Another couple things on the phone, I don't see that pink tint in low light level that people are talking about.  Colors do go a bit off toward red - at extremely low brightness - but still, white or gray doesn't go to pink for me.  Just slight warmer color temp so far as I can tell.  Working with color balance is part of my job so I was worried it would be annoying to picky eyeballs.  Not the case, on day one at least.
This is my new phone after an HTC One X+, which I had for over 2 years.  I liked it, except for the small, non-replaceable battery.<br/>The Nexus 6 has a much larger screen, which my old eyes appreciate.  It is very clear, and great for watching videos.<br/>The battery is much larger than my old phone, and I'm charging it every two to three days instead of at least once per day with the old phone.  The Turbo charger that comes with it is very fast.  It gives you about 6 hours of use after only 15 minutes or so, and a full charge in about 2 hours.  Much faster than my old phone.<br/>Note:  I am not a power user at all.  If most of your life revolves around your phone, your mileage may vary.<br/>I decided to get the unlocked version to eliminate a lot of the bloatware that AT&T;, and I suspect, the other carriers, load on the phone when you buy it from them.<br/>It comes with almost every Google app already installed, and it is easy to get the apps you want to transfer from the old phone installed on the new one.  Just go to Play/My apps on a computer and select the ones you want to transfer (unfortunately, one at a time) click on the "Install" button (it tells you if the app is compatible of the new phone before you click on install) and it will be downloaded to the new phone.<br/>The phone is easy to use.  There are a few things that are different with the Motorola from the HTC, but there is lots of info on the web about how to use the phone.<br/>I like it very much.
As of this writing, I have owned this phone for about six weeks. Though the model is over a year old, this phone is still plenty powerful. Coming from using a Galaxy S4 and an LG G2, I have come to appreciate the pure vanilla Android OS that is offered here. Some of the gimmicks on the S4 and G2 are missing, like burst mode photos, double tap awake, and the IR blaster. However, the stability I get from this flavor of the OS is worth the sacrifice (to me). Of course, you may want more advanced features. That said, this is the reason that Android is so awesome. Because Google opens their source code (Android operating system) out to the public, vendors are able to tinker with it how they see fit.<br/><br/>I was between this and paying almost double for the newer edition of the Nexus line (the Nexus 6P). Huawei (who made the Nexus 6P) is still a budding company (in my opinion). Motorola has been around for ages, they make solid products, and the battery life of their Android phones is far superior of most phones on the market today.<br/><br/>If you are on the fence between buying this phone (at such a reasonable price for the specs you get), I say go for it.
Been using my Nexus 6 for about a month now. Really great price at only 350 bucks and a great phone if you want something big.<br/><br/>Set up was crazy easy, I just popped in my sim from my old phone and it was good to go immediately. Phone feels solidly built, it's big but actually feels thin with the way it curves in the back towards the sides and bottom. Fits in my pocket much easier than I thought. Runs super smooth so far, can get a little hot when playing games while charging. AMOLED screen really pops and is even nicer with some minor adjustments. Dual front facing stereo speakers should be mandatory in every phone as they sound really great. Battery life isn't anything amazing but it gets the job done and charges up remarkably fast. Camera takes great pictures but taking videos is wobbly. Cell reception is great, WiFi is some of the best I have used in a phone and Bluetooth seems to connect with flawlessly with my car and is much less finicky than my old iPhone 4s, ipod and Lumia 640 I used to use. Best of all it's stock android so it looks really pretty without all the superfluous junk and it will get updates first and for a long time.
I bought this because I saw an amazing price sold by Warehouse Deals.  No doubt, the phone is much better (faster, smoother and just snappier in general) with Marshmallow, although I didn't get to use it much to gauge the battery life before I returned it.<br/><br/>The 2 main reasons I returned it were the poor battery and its size.  I found that it died within maybe 5 hours if I am using it heavily.  Perhaps I was expecting too much, but I couldn't really get through a day with just moderate use either.  As for the size, I found it just a tad too unwieldly and I did not feel like it was held securely when I tried to use it with one hand.  I definitely couldn't text comfortably with one hand and we can totally forget taking pics with one hand!<br/><br/>And finally, the fact that it lacked a micro sd card slot wasn't a deal breaker since I got the 64GB version, but that is always nice to have.<br/><br/>I have now since gotten a Moto X Pure (Style).  I definitely liked the AMOLED screen on the Nexus 6 better, although I missed the Moto features such as twist for camera when I had the 6.  Another feature that I liked on the Nexus 6 was the wireless charging.  All in all, the Nexus 6 is quite a huge phablet.  It is powerful enough and still has pretty decent specs compared to a lot of the phones that have just been released, and the price is falling quite a lot, so I wouldn't hesitate to get one if the reasons I mentioned above are not a big deal.
WOW! My husband and I are huge google nerds and decided to upgrade to this since my husband's last Nexus 4 decided to have horrible malfunction problems causing us to put that bad boy to bed. This was way larger then I expected. We actually received the case a day before the phone, placed my Nexus 5 in the case and thought this has to be a mistake. I have seen people walking around talking of their tablet size cellphones and thought how annoying and excessive. I was totally wrong. The Nexus 6 arrived and my daughter and I couldn't have been more excited.<br/>  The box it came in was simple yet professional. The phone is large, I wish I could've kept it but I would have definitely started having carpal tunnel syndrome after a while. This is really a gorgeous phone. The clarity for pictures taken is amazing, the screen itself is ridiculously clear! Hopefully, all of the defects that were mentioned by others have already been worked out. Google customer service is so on point though, I am really not worried about if something were to happen to the phone, within warranty period, and not have it replaced or fixed.
Excellent device. The size may be a little problem for some users. Even though the device is fully compatible with Verizon's network, Verizon wireless wouldn't activate.
This is probably one of the best deals on an unlocked phone right now. Just buy it. Yes, its huge. But thats a good thing. It's a really great phone. I give it 5 stars.
Google has a great phone here. the only draw back is the screen is very hard to read in bright sunlight. but not so much that I took away a star.<br/>I was an iHater that had to get an iPhone due to older/forked droid phones being so bad and I am on call a lot.  Ended up liking it and getting another. After the 6 came out and not being impressed, I wanted a bigger screen with out the bigger price tag. Security is a big concern so I am def not getting another bastardized phone again. Google has a good back up and update system in place now. With this phone you dont have to worry about the vendor or the carrier suppressing important security updates.<br/>Google account integration here is the biggest plus. I have had my domain hosted by google for 8? or 10? years. This phone is so seamless with the integration of everything it's very impressive.<br/>If you are leaving the iWorld don't forget to unregister your phone number with iMessage! And then any group messages you are on, those people will need to delete the thread and start over.
I received an invite to Project Fi. In order to participate, you need a nexus 6. What a great way to be on the ground floor for a great wireless service AND a good excuse to get a new phone.<br/><br/>And what a phone it is.<br/><br/>It is a big phone without being cumbersome or awkward. It really fits nicely in my hand - and I am coming from a Moto E, so this is a bit of a change. The curved back might give it a teeter-totter aspect, but it settles nicely. I really like the little dimple on the backit gives a nice reference point for your finger when you are holding the phone.<br/><br/>The power and volume buttons are well set and easily accessible. The usb port is on the bottom, the mic jack on the top.<br/><br/>The display is very, very sharp and clean. And big. So big. It makes everything look different - Netflix is very cool on a Nexus 6. Even everyday apps - gmail, my calendar, Keep, and other daily tools look so much nice on this big, crisp display. The screen clocks in at 1440x2560 (493 ppi) - this is a ... Read more
From the G1 onwards I've had only Nexii. This one doesn't disappoint. A bit HUGE for my taste. Did not buy out of the gate due to the ridiculous price it had at the beginning. But now at $400, was a fairer deal. Like all Nexus cameras, not the best, but it does the job and I think it's the best so far from the Nexus lineage.<br/>Now the sound! The double frontal loud speakers sounds, er, "delicious" and it makes a real pleasure to play games or to watch anything on that screen. Placement of buttons are where they need to be as this is a larger phone. Clarity of calls is superb, I think the best of all Nexii. Person on the other side sounds right next to you.<br/>Regarding battery, I was so afraid as I saw many reviews saying the worst about it. I am a heavy user, not of video or gaming, but rather of using it for reference, thus I'm opening and closing the phone constantly throughout the day. All II can say is.. my fears were unfounded!<br/>If you like Nexus,  this one is a keeper.
Kind of big, but for the cost I got it at a pretty good unlocked phone. Came from a GS3 so the more pure google interface took some getting used to.
If you have been considering this phone for a while but were unsure if a phone of this size would be good for you, your concerns weren't misplaced. This is a huge phone and you need big hands to operate this phone.<br/><br/>But apart from that, there's very little downside to this phone. This is a snappy phone, which has a battery that you'd find hard to discharge within a day, no matter how heavy you use it. Has a great display (supposed to be 4K) and great build quality.<br/><br/>The biggest advantage of this phone is that you have stock Android running on a very powerful hardware and lots of RAM. The result is everything just works seamlessly and app response times are very quick.<br/><br/>Go for it if you were already considering this phone. Now more than ever because it's more bang for your buck.<br/><br/>This really is a great phone and the hardware+software (stock Android) combination is what makes it so great.
Generally I love Motorola products because they are the ones who actually invented the cellphone but then they fell behind a little with the smart phones - until recently. Overall their smartphones have improved dramatically. I returned this Nexus 6 BECAUSE as soon as I got it appeared used with some slight blemishes on it. When I tried to activate it the phone immediately needed an update. When I tried to update it the phone never worked again it keep turn on and off by itself. I followed all the instructions to reset it but I could never get it to work. The price was good even cheaper then the manufacturer Motorola itself. However I ended up buying the new Motorola x Pure Edition from Motorola directly where they make the phone and engrave it for me on the spot so I am sure I am getting a brand new working phone. AND I DO LOVE MY NEW PHONE IT'S EVEN BETTER THAN THE NEXUS 6. WHEN THE NEXUS 6 IS WORKING
Bought this phone once I was out of contract with Verizon.  I purchased it specifically to use with Google's Project Fi to get out of my pricey wireless contract.  This is the 2014 model with an original MRSP of $600, but I got it for $350 one month before the 2015 Nexus 6P came out.  As reviewers have mentioned, this phone is not for everyone.  It is BIG!  But I've grown to like it.  I'm large myself at 6'5'' so I have no issues with the size.  The screen is beautiful.  I can read kindle books without  squinting at a small screen or without pulling out my iPad.  The camera shoots beautiful pictures and I have used it to create videos that I shot in 4K.  With a Quick Charge charger, it goes from 0 to 100% in less than 2 hours and the battery lasts for a long time.  And as a Nexus phones, you will always be first in line for Android updates.  If the size doesn't bother you, it is a great phone to have!
The next generation Google Nexus might not be made by Motorola anymore.  If you want a good Motorola phone, this is the best phone to get.
I am happy with my Nexus 6.<br/>Having read numerous reviews of Nexus 6, everything looked good to me except I was concerned that the camera might not be good enough. I still feel burned by my experience with the camera on my old Samsung Galaxy S4 and I really did not want to repeat that bad experience. (The S4's camera was totally crap in low light conditions.) I am happy to report that the camera on Nexus 6 is fairly good, even in low light conditions. I am very happy with it.<br/>I also considered these models, because reviews said they have excellent cameras:<br/><br/>I didn't buy Samsung Galaxy Note 4 (or Samsung Galaxy S6) because Samsung (and / or T-Mobile) are known for infrequent upgrades of the Android OS.<br/><br/>I didn't buy LG G4 because "LG has stated that they will never support unlocking the bootloader" (https://www.androidpit.com/lg-g4-vs-nexus-6-comparison)
My 3rd Moto android phone and the best by far. I'll never go back to a smaller phone. I think of it as a pocket tablet. Screen size is perfect for all the stuff I use it for. Almost don't need a laptop anymore. Android 5.1 is excellent. The phone did have the random reboot problem that was widely reported for Nexus 6, but it never happened while actually using the phone. And<br/>now the problem is completely gone with the 5.1 android update (phone came with 5.0.1). But it did take almost two months for the 5.1 update (OTA) to show up. I'm using Verizon, but I got the phone before they were selling it.<br/><br/>Note:  I actually wrote the above review on June 4th, 2015, not March 23rd as the website shows.<br/><br/>One more thing I want to mention: The Kindle app is great on this phone. This is the first Android phone I've been able to comfortably use it on. The screen size is finally big enough.
Fantastic, fast, gorgeous phone. I was afraid it might be too large for my smallish hands but it didn't take me any time at all to get used to it. I've had smartphones for years, all HTC, and even though I loved them all, there isn't an HTC phone out right now that I'd buy. Samsung is out because I have a new Samsung tablet and I don't like TouchWiz AT ALL. Too much extra junk on Samsung tablets and phones that just slows the device down. Googles Nexus 6 phone is very vanilla but you can spruce it up to your heart's content with any app you like. I bought the white 64 GB version and it's a beautiful phone. I'd buy it again.<br/>PROS<br/>Easy to see<br/>Fast, fast, fast<br/>Pure vanilla android<br/>Long lasting battery<br/>Super fast charging<br/>Stereo speakers<br/>CONS<br/>The speakers aren't quite HTC quality but they're still very good.
Coming from an aging Nexus 4 I expected a pretty dramatic upgrade. However what I received was a phone with the worse display( the screen is tinted orange, invisible in daylight, and just dingy and not bright.)<br/><br/>But its faster right? Well slightly. Despite having significantly better hardware software encryption hobbles it tremendously. It can't be turned off.<br/><br/>Additionally the bluetooth is very poor and the music cuts out constantly.<br/><br/>The battery life is slightly better than the Nexus 4 with an old worn out battery. That makes me a little nervous but the battery will be completely unacceptable within a year.<br/><br/>One bright. Is it the image sensor for the camera is dramatically better. Does the flash power is extremely weak.<br/>Skip this phone and wait for whatever is coming out next.
Great phone at an incredible price.  This is the best deal for an Android phone that is unlocked to work on all the major carriers that you will find anywhere.  All you need is a SIM for your carrier and badabing you are in business.  The major benefit to a Nexus device is that you don't get all of the crap bloatware that phone manufacturers and carriers seem to think we all want or need.  You also get the latest and greatest Android software version long before any other phone on the market.  This is my first Nexus phone but if they can continue making a great device unlocked and bloat free I might be a customer for life.<br/><br/>FYI for those on Sprint you will need the following SIM.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OE78KS4?psc=1&redirect;=true&ref;_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00 or you can get from Sprint.
Good phone. Huge but after a month of use I am used to it now. Battery is beast. Lasts longer than expected. A great phone
Fantastic phone upgraded from nexus 5 to nexu6 .... nexus 5 good phone,  nexus 6 ----- awesome and price is fantastic ...
Ordered this a couple weeks ago,  it's fantastic. I have unlimited with Verizon so this was definitely the best bang for buck new phone.  It works 100% with Verizon,  I actually took the Sim card out of my cracked Note 33, cut it with scissors (online tutorial) plugged it in and it's been working fine ever since.  Only thing I miss from Note 3 is the home button but I'm getting used to it.  Also since my last 3 phones were Samsung,  took a while to get used to power / volume buttons being lower.  Those are my only 2 "complaints" about the phone, but I am getting more accustomed to it by the day.<br/><br/>For the price,  it's a slam dunk.  Not the newest or fastest phone out there but it can keep up, for half of the price it was a no Brainerd for me!
This phone is awesome! I wasn't sure if I would like the size and at first it took a bit getting used to. Now I can't imagine using a smaller phone! The phone is very fast and smooth as well. The screen looks amazing and the battery life is better than I expected. The turbo charging is very cool. I just charged from 34% to 100% in about 40 minutes! I suggest a nice bumper or TPU case for it though. (I bought the Encase Flexishield case (Frosted White) from MobileFun.com). It is essentially clear and really shows off the beauty of the white Nexus 6. I'm on Google's Project Fi and really like that as well. This phone is a great deal for $400 for the 64gb version (I highly recommend the 64gb as the storage is not upgradeable).
The nexus 6 is a great phone, but is not for everyone. First it is huge. This is a reason I wanted it, but can be very unwieldy for most. Second it runs stock android 6.0 Marshmallow. I enjoy the clean, simple design which google has created. Many would rather have the feature rich skins which non-nexus devices ship with.<br/><br/>Other than these possible set backs, the nexus 6 is a great flagship device. It contains all of the top specs expected on a new phone. The build quality was quite premium and the AMOLED screen is a joy to use.<br/><br/>Since the price has been dropping recently, this is an exceptional buy. If you enjoy stock android and ridiculous screen size, this is the phone for you.
I really like this phone. I went from a T-mobile Samsung phone filled with bloatware to this pretty cool android. I was concerned that it would be too big but now I don't know if I could go back to a smaller phone. Yah, it is like pop-tart sized but that becomes an asset. The display is beautiful.It is lightning fast with long battery life. Updates come OTA easily. I like the camera and find my photos look pretty darned good. I understand that there are notification LEDs that only work if you root. I do miss having the LEDs for incoming message notifications but found app workarounds. Found a pretty slim case and with a glass screen protector here on Amazon that work well.
I've noticed several problems with the phone<br/>1. There was a line on the center of the screen which looked as if it broke at the center. After reboot, its fine and no line seen.<br/>  This happened few times and due to this I got completely freaked out.<br/>2. Sometimes the phone freezes and I am not even able to switch it off, I have to wait till the phone drains and it ultimately gets switched off.<br/>3. Even though there is enough ram available, the transition of apps close and opening the apps, I have noticed significant lag.<br/><br/>All these seems to be like software issues, but one of my friend's nexus 6 doesn't have all the above problems mentioned.
Ii is one of the best choice I've made in recent memory.  The Nexus 6, is not just a phone to me.
Nexus doesn't have the gimmick functions like my previous Samsung Galaxy Note 3. But Its a practical phone with high tech spec for its price. Only downside I came across the phone its with the T-Mobile service, voices breaks in and out like bad reception. I have to rely on Wi-Fi calling for a clearer reception. I have perfect hearing, and sometimes I have trouble hearing through the speaker part of the phone if I don't place my ear directly at the right spot. And the phone supposedly has this ergonomic curve on the back side, but I find it hard to text while placing it on the table. It will spin or wobble as you press against it.
Best phone that I ever had I Love The Nexus 6 you need this phone if you looking for a new one!
Perfect smartphone. Bit large for first time users but once you get used to it, you can't look back. The QHD screen is a treat to the eyes. The icons and text look amazingly clear. Amoled screen makes it even better. The camera quality is great as well. The body of phone is very appealing, with metal edges. I bought two of them. One white 64gb and the 32gb blue. The new updated price of Nexus 6 is more apt. I bought the Nexus 6 64gb at the original price of 699$ which i now believe was overpriced for it.<br/>Nexus always has an advantage of getting first updates from Google, that is always a plus.
Just LOVE the sheer size of the device, not very big for my hands  ;)<br/><br/>It performs admirably well and the SD805 is indeed a very capable CPU  coupled with 3GB of RAM, it can out perform some of the latest flagships, even those with a SD808, specially in graphics intensive apps and games.<br/><br/>Only thing I dislike, which might not be an major issue to complaint about, is the battery. It gets HOT while charging, yet gets cooler by the time it's nearing a full charge ;)<br/><br/>Added to that, you have a NEXUS device, with a suoerb updating system from Google ;)
Gotta love the Google products. I've always been a fan of Google and especially Nexus phones. This has been my favorite phone of all time. I love the curved back, the screen and most importantly, the ability to unlock the phones bootloader.<br/>The phone is near perfect in every way. My only complaints are about the quality of the cameras. They tend to be over exposed or slightly blurry in certain low light situations or in mixed light. This isn't a big deal for me, but it's something that should be better. Overall I'd give the phone a 4.6/5. So round it up to a 5.
I am an Apple person but took a chance on this phone. Have not regretted the choice.
The nice phone ever, for me of course. Better than IPhone because I hate the apple
For the price the Nexus 6 is going for on Amazon now, you can't beat this device! Coming from a 2014 Moto X that is always advertised as being as close to "stock Android" as you can get, I can tell you there's no substitute for real Stock Android! Running the latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow, the Nexus 6 is as smooth and fast as any smart phone I've ever seen. In comparison to the newest Droid Turbo 2, it is still much smoother. I've yet to see the new Nexus 6p in person, but for the price difference, I'm in no rush to upgrade!
I have not been this happy with a phone in a long time. I had an iPhone and bought this to replace it. I just love Android. The phone is so easy to navigate. It's big enough to read a book on. I built a résumé on it! I refused to pay $400 for a phone I didn't love. This one, the price was awesome. I am excited. I have had it almost a month with no issues. My battery lasts forever. I believe that's why it takes longer to charge. It is worth it as I always am within reach of one. I have fat fingers so the keyboard is awesome too.
While the phone functions OK, I asked and said the phone was manufacturer unlocked, unprogrammed.  Nexus phones allow hotspot and tethering; this one was carrier modified to deny that feature.  Original Nexus phones don't do that.  It's a function I use on occasion that's very important to me.  Unfortunately unless I want to possibly destroy the phone by opening the source code to re-enable this feature by unlocking it totally, I'll have to live with what I get.  If you want tethering or hotspot, don't buy from this seller.
Didn't fancy this blue color very much, but it is without any doubt the fastest and smoothest smartphove I've ever saw. Be aware that the Nexus 6 isn't meant for the gerenal public, buy it only if you already are a power user that's into modding or if you are willing to start with this life, otherwise I guess that other phones may suit you better.<br/>About the size, it is BIG, you'll need big hands to get used, but it sure doesn't feel as big as it looks. That's due to it's curved back, which makes it fits in your hand.
I spent over an hour setting up the phone as it updated from 5.0 to 5.0.1 to 5.1 to 5.1.1 and then added even one more update.  I added a handful of popular apps and a few games (nothing exotic or complex).  I noticed that the phone had some lag and was not very snappy.  Even simplistic games had a lot of lag and stutter.<br/><br/>I loved my old LG Nexus 5 and even turned on encryption and didn't notice big performance differences with KitKat. I was expecting to love my new Nexus 6. Perhaps I had a defective Nexus 6 or there was a performance bug in 5.1.1. Anyhow, I am surprised, disappointed, and have it boxed up ready for return.
The phone is big, but managable.  The processor is incredibly fast, and the user interface is great.  I was a little nervous about using a device with native android software, but it actually seems to work better than the loaded down versions that you get with other brands.  One of the best features of this unlocked phone is that it will work on any network, CDMA or GSM.  I am so glad to have this phone and wonder how I tolerated previous phones with all the bloat ware that they all have embedded.
Stepping up from a note 2 (And i still love the note 2 with cm12 on it) this upgrade only seemed logical.<br/>I love the screen size. the additional .5 inch makes a difference for me. More is better. period.<br/>Front Facing stereo speakers are great for youtube and occasional netflix.<br/>Lastly the storm trooper white look feels different and sexy.<br/><br/>My first piece unfortunately turned out faulty and i asked for a replacement which went through just fine.<br/>Enjoying the upgrade
Bought Google Phone with 64GB, but freezes every now and then and reboot clears it. Not sure if my apps or data is overly loaded but I thought 64GB would be enough. When the phone becomes unresponsive, only a reboot can clear it. Its rather large phone but I am finally used to carrying it and use it as a Phablet. No more dependent on a 8" tablet I used to carry along. Screen is sharp and now I can use it to watch movies or TV shows in bed. Excellent phone for $399 after the price drop.
This is my first android phone and I like it. It is fast, and big- which I like being an old timer it is easier to read and also I don't fat finger as much typing.<br/> It has run everything I have put on it very smoothly, and the battery lasts me a couple of days, I mostly just listen to music or audiobooks.<br/><br/> Might not be the best phone for everyone, because it is big,  but it fits my paws just fine and no problem in my pocket..... but I don't wear "skinny jeans."
Love the phone the only thing i dislike is the screen color calibration it really goes to the warm side tho it isn't that bad but still a just a tiny bit more white would be good<br/><br/>The Phone is Fast, Smooth, is light not heavy as my previous HTC ONE MAX. Speakers sound very well close enough to the HTC. They're loud and clear.<br/><br/>Battery isn't that surprising as other said but hopefully with the arrival of Lollipop 5.1 it will be fix to match other phones with the same amount of charge
This is the most unique phone you can buy for under 400 dollars. It has both cdma and gsm receivers in it so no issue taking it to all 4 carriers. You are in for a treat if you are a into Google products. With Google launching project fi.<br/>The Android os on this phone is very light compared to Samsung touch wiz. No bloat.<br/>The quality is top of the line no need for a case unless you need one for other reasons.<br/>Sound on this phone is these out of every phone I ever owned.
A very solid and well built Nexus phone by Motorola and Google. Running the latest version of Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) and it runs like a dream. Extremely quick, great battery life, and a gorgeous AMOLED screen that is 5.96 inches. Speaker quality is loud, but does not distort. Call quality is both crisp and clear with great signal strength. The Snapdragon 805 processor is a beast, and can run apps very quickly. Even with the new Nexus 6P out, I feel there is no reason to upgrade.
After having this phone for 5 days when I would receive an incoming call the phone would ring but you were unable to answer it because the call never appeared on the screen, even if the phone was locked. Spent two hours on the phone with Motorola troubleshooting the problem. A factory reset was the only way to resolve the problem. will probably return to Amazon. If you google  Nexus 6 receiving call problems you will see a lot of info about this trouble. Think twice before you buy
Very fast phone, screen resolution is quad HD and it looks awesome, good battery life not great for the size but it has wireless charging and rapid charge. It's a big phone but the feel in hand is very good, it feels smaller but slippery so I recommend a case. I bought the Spigen Ultra Hybrid, its cristal clear on the back with gray edge and it looks great. The best of all is stock Android. If you are looking for a phablet at a great price this is hands down the one to buy.
Had this phone for over a month now. Coming from an iphone 5 to this is amazing. I flip flop from iphones to Andriod on a regular and i have to say Andriod has come a long way. The last andriod phone i had was running ice cream sandwich and back then battery life was an issue. But with this phone. I have np problems. I can have this phone on all day and after a long day. Ill be home to charge it. If you wanna get into the phablet market this is a great phone for you!
The best phone I have ever used. But, I bought this assuming that nexus will be the first to receive the latest software(Marshmallow) from Google. But, I being on AT&T; is at mercy of the my provider rather than google. A huge disappointment on that front and hence 4*. Else, this deserves 5 * phone. For those moving from 5 inch phones, the size might feel huge and takes some time to get adjusted. Once you get used, the other phones looks like minions :)
I bought this to go with the google fi program.<br/><br/>Straight to the point:<br/>*No bloatware from cell phone companies.  So I feel it runs smoother with less issues.<br/>*Camera quality is good.  Compared with my spouses iPhone 5 at night and it seems the night mode was a bit better.<br/>*Antennae isn't as strong as the iPHONE 6 that just came out but it is also older than the iPhone 6.  Seems to be pretty comparable to the iPhone 5 Antennae.
For those who can handle the massive 6" screen size, this is the best phone you can get for the money.  Forget about all of the cons that others might point out, the biggest plus is that this is a Nexus phone, so Google directly supports it.  Marshmallow was available the day that Google released it, and unlike other OEM phones, has no carrier or OEM bloatware.  Just pure Android, updated faster than any other phones outside of the Nexus line.
This phone's size seemed like a disadvantage at first, but once I adjusted to it I was able to stretch out and sleep comfortably without my head or feet hanging off the edges. Sheets made for a california king size are only slightly tight on the device.<br/>It's a big phone.<br/>Phone is very well made and thinner than anticipated. Screen is excellent and when dimmed gets very dark if using at night without blinding yourself is a priority.
Got the 64gb model for $259 Black Friday special.  Was able to activate on Sprint without issues.  Just went online and it recognized the IMEI immediately.  I had an extra nano SIM from Sprint, so I popped that in and was running in no time.  The phone appears to keep LTE signal better than my HTC One phone, so I am pleased.  It is a bit large, but not very bothersome.  The screen is amazing and vibrant.  Overall, a great buy, even at $399.
Pro<br/>1. Stock Android (if you like that).<br/>2. screen looks stunning.<br/>3. very well built.<br/>4. Nexus phones are easily rooted.<br/><br/>Con<br/>1. Screen has a pinkish shade when brightness is turned down.<br/>2. The battery life of this phone is sub-par. It has a 3000ish Mah battery, but I usually get only 3 hours of screen time from it.<br/>3. low light pictures and videos are not good. There are alot of statics.
I got this on the day after it got into the USC Store, and was planning on getting a Moto X anyway.<br/><br/>This is my first smartphone (Lucky me, getting a nice phone and all), so it might be a little biased, but when I compare it to my friends' Phones (including a iPhone 6+), I find it much better.<br/><br/>The screen size usually is no problem, and having all that space is great. When you get it, I can guarantee you people will ask you "Is that your phone?" to which of course the reply is "Yes, it's a Phablet"<br/><br/>Rooting was easy using ChainFire's Autoroot, and I haven't had any major problems at all.
I have been using my Nexus 6 for a few days now. I was aware of the "pink" effect the display had if you turned the brightness all the way down in Adaptive Brightness. But my screen turned blue. Even when I turn my phone off. I can see the blue tint on the screen mostly when I'm outside exposing the screen to sunlight or inside with regular lightbulbs. Does anybody experience this? Is this normal? Should I send it back?
Phone works great. Its a little bigger than I'm used to, but I got over that pretty quickly.  You will need a nano SIM card, which my Verizon store would not give me. After a long talk with tech support, they eventually mailed me a SIM. However, I also learned that you can cut down a micro SIM to make it work in a nano slot, which is what I ended up doing. Once I did this, the phone registered on the network and worked great!
to all the people slamming this phone, just got mine today, i have owned every nexus phone and this is my second nexus 6. these are not clearance type old models gathering dust. you can power on the phone volume down+ power then scroll to barcode to see manufacture date. mine is 8-22-2015. thats not even a month old. this is a great phone if you like BIG PHONES!!!....  for 349 you will find nothing better without a contract
I have changed my LG G3 for this huge piece of work.<br/>I have being using this for 2 weeks so far so good. Not happy yet with the lollipop. I'm also testing Android car with a Pioneer stereo, very good but very beta phase.<br/>I like the device. I'm not really happy with Lollipop, but itself the motorola does his job. 32 GB storage might be a little bit short for this device.<br/>Good luck for the new buyers.
So far has been the best Android I've owned to date. At first the size seems overwhelming but you get uses to itbvwry quick. Once you do it seems impossible to go back to using anything less in size. The front facing speakers are awesome. Those alone make the phone top notch, and that's not even getting into how responsive and quick the device is. Well worth the money glad I waited for them to drop in price.
Love this phone! Got it on sale for $350 from Amazon. Yes it's big, but that's why I wanted it! The screen it clear and bright - and its easy to do the other 80% of things I use a smartphone for besides making calls. Got the Unicorn Beetle Supcase along with the Yootech tempered glass screen protector and its a thing of beauty. Oh and Project Fi as well. If you want a bigger screen, this is a great choice.
Great phone, my first Android and honestly its great. People are going to say the screens too big, but once you start using it you won't go back to a smaller screen.<br/>Only thing is its hard to text with one hand, and the front facing camera is only 2MP, but that's only bad things I can say. Great phone and even better price compare to that of other phones at the same price range.<br/><br/>Cheers,
Got 2 of these for 200$ each.Awesome phone worth the price
Happy with 95% of an 800 dollar phone for 50% of the price
Solid phone. The phone is built well and feels high quality. The buttons feel elegant and are not that sensitive which is great since most phones have sensitive buttons which turns them on when they should be on. Overall the phone is solid and the charging speed is awesome too. The battery life is questionable since my old one plus phone still has better battery life than the nexus 6.
I dropped my iPad and shattered the screen. Meanwhile my iPhone 4 was getting long in the tooth. I decided to get a big phone and try to live with one device. Two months in I'm saying it was a genius move. Big in the pocket sure, but big when it comes to web surfing, email, buying stuff on Amazon, etc. Super great as a GPS unit when I travel. Holy cow! Love, love, love this device.
I've had the NEXUS 4 & 5 phones and loved them. Great phones.  I now have 6 purchases from Amazon. However... I've had it a month and its frozen and rebooted itself 4 times. I was texting in HANGOUTS this morning when screen went 3/4 black and froze. After about a minute it began to reboot.  Comes back up fine.  It's odd.  Just sharing.  When it works I love it. Thinking of returning before it's too late...
Nice phone. I bought this for $350, will definitely recommend this at that price. Over all built quality is good and even a better brand that one plus which sells similar configuration phone at the same price tag. I would go for this instead of an One Plus. It does have some software issues and even the screen size is very big, these are the two big drawbacks for this phone.
This phone is quite large. It is nice for watching videos with the sound and size of the screen. I went from a pretty big phone (Note 2) and I have no intentions of going back to another phone. I use it with the project fi and it seems to have pretty good service in the 2 weeks I have had it. I have not had a chance to do some travelling and see how it is in other areas.
If you are thinking of getting it, get it. I am on Verizon and it seems android 5.1 is rolling out later than other carriers but its not because of the phone. It is difficult to get a glass screen protector to fit because of the curved edges, but hey... Its the best phone I have ever owned and I am usually a galaxy owner. No thanks galaxy s6 I'll stick with this!!!!
Incredible phone, I never expected a phone not made by apple could achieve this level of quality. The display is gorgeous, very bright when needed, the phone is fast, smooth, the camera is muchos better than what I expected after reading some reviews. I am loving the Wireless charging cappabilities built in,  I think that I like Android even more than iOS.
Buy it as a 24-hour discount on Black Friday (Luckily, I got it). At first sight, it is really huge (in comparison with my iphone). But after a day using, now I am familiar with it. Fit in my jean pocket (even with case cover). Very high quality screen, and the two stereo speakers are so wonderful.<br/>In addition, it has been upgraded to Android 6.0. :)
It's really 4.5 stars. Not perfect but a very good phone. Great for large hands. Above average call quality. Very good hd quality screen. Above average photo and video. Above average battery life for a screen this large. Lots of available accessories. No added bloatware, just a pure Android experience. Cannot add an SD card. Very happy with this purchase.
Good phone for the price. Use the phone for a month now. The 4G LTE often lost connection. I'm not sure because of the phone or T-mobile. Battery life is not impressive, however, the charging time is quite fast. Beside that everything else is good. In conclusion, if you need a functional phone within your budget, you could give it a try.
Really want to like this phone. After upgrading to Android 6.0, the phone has become slightly lagged. Battery life is incredible, consistently going 30+ hours between charges. AMOLED screen is great for its size, wish it weren't so wide though. The phone is without a doubt, a two-hander.<br/><br/>At this price point, it's a great buy.
This phone exceeded all my expectations.  Yes, it's really huge, and sometimes it can be inconvenient ... but it's zippy, responsive, and the battery life is much longer than on my Nexus 5.  If you could afford it, definitely get this.  Plus getting the first Android updates are a plus.  I just got a 5.1.1 update today!
A beautiful work of art with a great screen size , love it for its graphic quality and speed with size, also upgraded it to Marshmallow. best of all paid half of the selling price which makes it the best deal in town . IT may be a better quality than the new replacement .Motorola is a bullet proof manufacture .
Switched from IPhone 5S.  Very happy with size and design of Nexus 6.  I originally purchased the iPhone as it was required for work.  Never really drank the Apple coolaid and happy to switch back to a more intuitive system.  In addition, also switched from T-Mobile to Google Project Fi.  Very happy with both.
As soon as i opened the sealed box and saw this HUGE phone i fell in love with it! I could not ask for a better phone. It is a very very beautiful device which as completely replaced my Samsung tablet for good! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DEVICE..... STOP LOOKING FOR A PHONE THIS IS THE BEST PHONE FOR ANDROID!
This is an awesome Pure Android phone.  I got one for $299 and now you can find them for $199, unbelievable.  I am super happy with mine, I don't need stupid finger print scan and such.  To some it might be big, but I don't think it really is, plus is curved in the back so it's pretty thing on the edges.
Upgraded from Galaxy S4.<br/>Much better battery life, screen, call quality and performance.<br/>After receiving the phone I checked IMEI number on Verizon website and it was compatible with Verizon network. Had no issues activating it at Verizon kiosk at BJ's.
I was wary about buying this phone, but I needed to start my Google Project Fi service quickly.  Now, after having the phone for a couple of weeks, I have found an additional traveling companion that serves me my multimedia flawlessly.  Just wish they would have put in a removable memory card option.
Excellent cell phone!  I have been using it for few weeks now.  I love the big screen (5.96 inches diagonally).  I love the excellent deal - it used to be $500 but now it's $350.  Comparing to my previous cell phone (Blu Windows phone 16gig), it's very fast.  I would buy again.  I would recommend.
This phone basically requires a case. There's a very sharp edge at the bottom of the phone, so if you're accustomed to holding a phone with one hand (and your pinky at the bottom) then you'll be continuously stabbed by it due to the weight of a large phone.<br/><br/>Other than that, it's nice.
After you get over the sheer size if this phone it quickly becomes the best phone you ever had.  I was weary of the phone because of reports of screen burn in and size.  After a few weeks and the cruizerlite case I can say this phone handles everything I can throw at it without a hiccup.
Bought this when it was on sale for $400. Upgrading from a Nexus 5. This phone is a beast. Fast, no lag in programs. Beautiful finish on the phone chassis. Awesome display. Isn't really as big as a lot of people think it is. Fits perfect in your hand. Totally worth the money to buy it.
I have always been a fan of Google phones this one did not disappoint battery life great screen large and clear couple of flaws is the screen does not get extremely bright and camera is an upgrade but could of been better seeing this came out same time as the turbo could of been better
At first the phone was huge in my hands but now it feels like its just the right size. The phone is a beast!!  Literally it will do just about anything any other phone can. The only blunder is the front camera in low light situations but aside from that, this is the phone to get!!!
BEWARE BUILD # LNX07M. I purchased two Nexus 6 each arrived brand new, but different Build numbers. One worked perfectly, but the second with Build# LNX07M was inoperable. It would not download and update the Android operating system. Had to return this phone for a replacement.
The phone is simply awesome!! The size is good if you are like me who is into big devices. The screen resolution and camera are really good and I have to say that Android Marshmallow is really smooth and so far it has supprised me with a couple new features. 100% Recommended!!
Fantastic phone, Qi wireless charging is great, screen is fantastic, with Android 6 the phone is the most current you can buy...only missing:<br/>Laser Focus on Camera, 64bit CPU, fingerprint sensor.<br/>None will be needed in 2016, so save your money and rock the Nexus 6...
Bought this phone because I have a Verizon unlimited data plan. I just popped my nano in to this bad boy and everything just works. As long a moto keeps up with its we work with all carries phone they will continue to get my money. Side note love the unlocked bootloader.
Great phone so far, size is a bit much, but if you treat it more as a small tablet, it's incredible. Just a note, I use speaker phone or Bluetooth it, so I never really hold it to my ear. Great for internet and games, picture quality is far improved from the Nexus 5.
The phone I received was the US version compatible with Google Fi. The only reason for 4 stars is the size. It's awkward to carry in a pants or coat pocket and my thumb can't reach completely to the opposite side of the screen while palming it. PS: Google Fi rocks!
I've been a Samsung user for years but got fed up with always having to replace the screen, motherboard and sometimes the entire phone. I recently purchased the Nexus 6 and I LOVE this device it is by far the best device,as far as phones go, I have ever owned....
Is fast sleek as a great battery runs everything beautifully I love the big screen personally and the camera takes amazing pictures it has so many cool features to like the turbo charge and the ambient display if your pure Android lover this is the phone for you
Great phone, price, battery life, and updates straight from Google.<br/><br/>Went from a Nexus 5 to this phone and wouldn't go back.  If you are unsure about the size of the phone, you really should just get it.  Took some getting used to but now I love it.
good phone! love the size even though it's very thin.most definatly need a case to protect it in case it falls. The size is very over rated.I have average hands and it seem small to me. Highly suggest getting a good protectiv case like mako heavy duty case.
The Nexus 6 run's perfectly, fast and smooth and the AMOLED panel is awesome, BUT... After only one month of light use that gorgeous display has some image retention or burn-in and that is in excusable. I should have sent it back as soon as I noticed it.
tl;dr Phone had crack in screen, told Motorola, cost to fix was $0, Motorola had phone for week and repair status was "INPROGRESS", called to see how it was going and was informed that they wouldn't do anything until I paid a fee.<br/><br/>I love my Nexus 6. It is a great phone. I have noticed online that other people have had issues with the screen cracking, and unfortunately I became one of them.<br/><br/>I contacted Motorola through their repair website, and entered in detailed information about the damage to the phone. It was very clear from the selections that I made that this was physical damage to the screen. I was given a confirmation number, and a cost of $0 for the repair. No credit card information was taken, and there was no mention of payments or fees. I was also told I would have a phone back within 4-5 business days.<br/>All of this was smooth as butter. They emailed me a fedex label, and I sent my phone back to Motorola. Everything seemed fine. A few days go by, and then it was the holiday weekend so I assumed that it would take a bit of extra time.<br/><br/>Every day I would go to Motorola's website and check on the status, which after a couple days showed up as "INPROGRESS", which I took to mean that the repair/replacement was in progress.<br/><br/>After it had been almost two weeks I decided to give them a call to see if they had an ETA on the repair. They informed me that there was no work order open for the phone, since there hadn't been a fee collected for the physical damage. So, not only were they not upfront about this fee, they gave me a price of 0$, accepted the phone through the mail, and never bothered to contact me about their decision to not do anything with it.<br/>I spent an hour and 22 minutes on the phone, talking with 4 different Motorola employees, and none of them could help me out. They admitted that they shouldn't have been able to even collect the phone with it being physically damaged without the fee being paid, and that the online system shouldn't have been able to let me get a shipping label. So something went wrong on their end. This kind of stuff happens, I get it.<br/><br/>But now they have my phone, admitted they made a mistake, yet they won't honor or acknowledge the information I was given when I made the decision to send them my device.<br/><br/>So, my phone is essentially a hostage, and Motorola is demanding ransom for repairs. They ship it back to me in the slowest way possible, but they won't even send it back with overnight shipping since they seem to see no problem with what they have done.<br/>I am appalled at their attempts at customer service, and how no one seems to be able to or even care about helping me.
Cons:<br/>This is sort of going to sound like a rant, my apologies.  I ordered a phone when Amazon listed it for $400 (64gb, cloud white).  Had a few issues. The camera was complete garbage and every shot was dark.  The batty life was abysmal.  The screen has discoloration all over the right side of it (I have removed the screen protector just to ensure that it wasn't the screen protector causing this problem).  So I returned it and promptly bought another.  The screen didn't have issues on the second one, but a letter was bent in on the backing "nexus" and was starting to come up.  I have no clue how this ever happened because the box was sealed.  Now I'm returning it and have purchased my THIRD Nexus 6. I did notice that the battery life was nothing like it was compared to my first order (maybe it was an actual issue with the battery). The screen has discoloration at the bottom of the third one, but screw it.  I can tolerate this one more than my first one.  Quality control is nonexistent for these.  A couple of other cons I think are no microSD slot (luckily the 64GB version is cheap), and its hard to find a place to put my phone in my car lol.  The phone is also really wide and makes it damn near impossible to do much with one hand.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Screen size is awesome for web surfing.  I prefer it over my laptop.  Battery life is great when nothing is actually wrong with the battery.  It's a Nexus so you're first in line for Android updates.  I was skeptical of the processor included on this phone but I have no gripes with it so far.  Typing is pretty easy on the larger screen.  The phone is pretty thin and fits well in pockets.  I love that they raised the back end of the phone more at the top so that the camera remains flush with the body and is not protruding like most phone's cameras do nowadays.  The speakers are the best I've ever heard on any phone.  Android Marshmallow is great. Comes with a turbo charger!!  64GB for cheap.<br/>This phone has turbo charging which is a HUGE lifesaver for a battery this big.  This phone also includes wireless charging which was a requirement for me!  Thank you Motorola for including this!  Once you really get used to using wireless charging (I have 3 throughout my house and one at work), you won't want to charge your phone any other way.<br/><br/>All in all, this phone is worth it.  If you get a lemon, the return process is great and you can order another one before sending yours back so you don't have to go without a phone.  Thank you Amazon for this great policy.
Received this device about a month prior to this review.  Shipped and sold by Amazon.<br/><br/>Not my first Nexus phone.  Both the DW and myself had Nexus 4's as well as other android smart phones and devices.<br/><br/>The Nexus line is sometimes referred to as a developer's phone, maybe true prior to the more mainstream availability of the nexus 4.  It offers a "pure android" experience. Some might say its a platform for Google to showcase the direction it intends to take its operating system.<br/><br/>For the most part, I prefer an unforked version of android, but did enjoy some of the software features built into the UI by other android smartphone manufactures.  I skipped the Nexus 5 and carried a LG 3.  While it was a great device and offered some great features, it sometimes was a bit janky.<br/><br/>As for the Nexus 6<br/>With the recent drop in price of this phone, it may arguably be the best bang for the buck going.  It also can offer a ton of carrier savings if Google's "Project Fi" MNVO works for you.<br/>Currently, my wifes nexus 6 is on Project Fi and her bill is coming in around 32.00 a month.  This is a tremendous savings for us over what her current T-Mobile plan was costing.  She is extremely satisfied with her Project Fi service and Nexus 6.<br/><br/>I was motivated by the price to jump back into a Nexus.  Was not that pleased with the original price of the Nexus 6, so I purchased the LG G3 at a much lower cost.  We always pay outright for our devices, sometimes from Amazon, sometimes from the playstore and sometimes at T-mobile.<br/><br/>The LG G3 has a better screen than this phone. IMHO, the layout of the camera and volume buttons on the G3 was way more practical as well as a few other software features.  But, hated being stuck on android version 5.0, and that's the beauty of a google nexus device, quick updates and current software.<br/><br/>While this phone is more than adequate for my needs and at its current price recommend it, honestly I will likely purchase the Nexus 6P as soon as it becomes available again on the play store.  Google is now offering a protection plan, that along with project fi is pushing me to leave T-Mobile.<br/>I may change my mind after this phone receives its Marshmallow update, but reviews of the new 6p are extremely positive. I do have a project fi<br/>sim coming for this device and there are good arguments that the new nexus 6P is not spec wise, that big of an upgrade to warrant the costs.<br/><br/>In close,<br/>There are many reviews covering every little nuance of the Nexus 6, its performance, features and hardware.<br/>Guess, I choose to consider it's overall value and potential if you factor that it is also one of the few devices that can be used with Project Fi.<br/>If I expressed my opinion, on the Android side, I think Samsung's newest device's are the best, but there is other factors.<br/><br/>Will add, really like using Android pay.  It is working seamlessly with this device at merchants that support it.  Hope it sees more merchant support.<br/>This device also plays nicely with my blue tooth devices, chromecast and hot spotting to my Chromebook while traveling.
Beast of a phone that works on all carriers and is gorgeous to look at, read, type.<br/><br/>My first android phone was a Droid 2 Global by Motorola that I absolutely loved to death due to it's longevity, ruggedness and slide out keyboard for ease of typing.  After it started to be come slow, sluggish and eventually crapped out on me.  I thought I'd never go back to a Motorola device but seeing this gorgeous phone last year I knew I wanted it.  However I didn't want to buy it at the full 700+ dollar price tag and I was happy with my old phone at the time.  But then I needed something knew and seeing the iPhone 6+, I knew I wanted something big but not Apple, since I'm pretty deep into Android now.<br/><br/>Lets talk about the screen.  It's absolutely massive and gorgeous to look at.  It's a 5.96 diagonal AMOLED screen that screams beauty.  And the best thing about AMOLED is that the blacks are very black, since the screen in that area is not on.  This saves battery life which is very, very crucial for this phone.  Having this 2560x1440 resolution on a phone means very sharp, crystal clear pictures, messages, games, and movies but it does come at a cost of average battery life.  I have my brightness setting at around 1/4 or 1/5 of the brightness bar.  This, honestly, doesn't bother me much since I can still see everything on this screen well.  It's still bright enough for me to read my messages in almost direct sunlight.  I might have to rotate it towards me a bit, but I did that with my other phones.<br/><br/>The little divot where the motorola symbol is helps tremendously in being able to cradle and hold this phone.  I do have slightly larger than normal hands but I've always used my phones two handed for typing anyway and this is a lot better than having to squish my hands together to type.  Plus I can, with that divot, still use swype to type if I need too.<br/><br/>Audio quality is amazing on this thing.  I came from another phone that revolutionized front facing speakers and loved it back then.  These are honestly a lot better and a lot louder, and I keep the volume half way.  This is coming from a guy who likes his music louder than normal and I feel like this phone is too loud.<br/><br/>This phone supports every US carrier (the US model) and since most of the carriers now are doing away with contracts (and having you pretty much have a phone-loan now), buying this at it's 400 dollar price tag is a steal.  If you're a die-hard android fan or like to tinker with phones, this is the one to get.  There is a GREAT group of devs and support for this phone.<br/><br/>Even with the new Nexus devices right around the corner, I'm very glad that I bought last year's Nexus 6. Well worth it, just make sure you have a portable charger with you to help alleviate that slightly above average battery life.
Size: I have small hands but I don't find the phone too big to use for me. It was just an adjustment!. I also think the phone is the perfect size for reading and using like a tablet, but not so big that it's too big to carry around for daily use. I had a Nexus 7 for a tablet previously and while I loved the thing, it was a bit too big for my hands and I had to carry it in my bag or purse. This one still fits in my back pocket while I'm walking around, even in tight pants!<br/><br/>Screen: The resolution on the screen is amazing, definitely the best I've seen on a phone so far! Like how the phone automatically adjusts the brightness based on how much light is in the room, It is also very easy to adjust yourself! Youtube videos and pictures look very sharp and clear on the screen!<br/><br/>Sound: I love the two speakers on the phone. I especially like how they are on the front side of the phone rather than the back. It's like surround sound in your hand! Sound can get very loud and always sounds pretty clear.<br/><br/>Battery: First of all, the charger than comes with this phone is awesome. It charges the phone insanely fast! The battery is pretty good on the phone as well. I use my phone a lot during the day for different purposes, I usually have bluetooth and GPS turned on too, and it typically lasts until the late evening. Even longer if I stay on WIFI. If it is a day when I don't do much with it other than the occasional text and phone call the battery lasts until I'm ready to go to sleep for the night. I've had phones with longer battery life, but I don't think the battery life on this one is anything to complain about especially considering the size of the screen.<br/><br/>Camera: As a professional photographer I am always big about how the camera is on a phone. This one is amazing! The back facing camera is very sharp and clear, it also works great in low light. I like how the flash on the phone has two small lights on either side of the camera. The front facing camera is good as well, however it is not as clear as the back one, which is to be expected. I love the camera app to take pictures, it has panorama and sphere settings which is always a nice little bonus to have. I also love how the Nexus 6 automatically backs your photos up to your google account.<br/><br/>Features: Of course works great with all the good apps and products. A personal favorite of mine is that you can cast your home screen to Chrome Cast. Which is great if you want to show someone a video on Facebook, or have a music app that doesn't have the cast feature!<br/><br/>I've had this phone for about three weeks now and I have no major complaints so far! Also, For anyone that wants to know I use my phone with Straight Talk on AT&T; towers!
I was a little hesitant to buy such a big phone, as i have heard lots of people complain. But im very glad i did! I don't think i canbgo back to a small phone after enjoyong such a premium product. It fits well in my pocket, that was my nunber one concern. When i whip it out, people are impressed with it's size and vitality. I love the big screen, so much easier to enjoy things on it. We are a culture who looks at their smart phones for several hours a day, might as well delight in the experience and make the view as big and clear as possible; that's what the nexus 6 can do for you. The phone is awesome, just go to gsmarena.com and check out nexus 6 specs. It runs flawlessly. Now here is my only negative-ish comment: i like to save money. So i got this phone "used". I put quotes because im not really sure if it was used or not. But Amazon said it was. You see, i went to the Used section and found one selling from the Amazon Warehouse describing it as "item is in original packagaing, but packaging has damage". I took that as "new item, but box has some scuffs and scrapes on it". I figured that was well worth the $80 i will save, so i bought it. I knew i took a gamble. When it arrived, the packaging was definitely scraped up and dirty, but upon first glance, phone looked brand new. And still had the plastic screen covering on it. It looked like it had never been touched, and im positive it hasnt been used. But when i flipped the phone over, it had one noticeable scratch om the backing. Like someone did a light chop to it with a steak knife, maybe 1/4" in lenght and very thin, but still noticeable. It doesnt look like it was dropped, bc the rest of the back was in pristine condition. And phone works great. I can only speculate what happened at this point. But what matters is i saved $80 by getting a new phone with a small scratch on the back. Was well worth it.
Bought phone after an obsessive amount of research, upgrading from a Samsung Galaxy S4 (GT-I9500).<br/><br/>First off, the screen of the N6 is roughly the size of the entire S4 (case included), so it's huge. And I must emphasize, that is JUST the display. So it's a tiny bit bigger than that altogether. Get out the rulers, because you really need to be ready for a big phone that'll usually make you use two hands.<br/><br/>My hands are roughly 7" long from middle finger tip to bottom of palm (I feel strange to mention this, but my review needs reference) and I find this phone just comfortable enough. Some people complain about this, I don't. Or at least don't anymore... Got the phone. Beautiful display. Beautiful audio. Camera handles far better than S4 and makes colors really pop in HDR+ mode and far less blurry shots (shaky hands). It's beautiful. No SD slot, which sucks, but oh well.<br/><br/>One thing I noticed is that the whole UI is gigantic out of the box. I felt like an old man who got an old man TV remote with the GIGANTIC numbers. So I did what I felt needed to be done: I modded the hell out of the phone after updating to 5.1.1. Among the MANY things I've done to the phone, I changed the DPI so everything looks all tiny and now the phone practically believes it's a small tablet (you'd need to do your homework to follow what I'm saying here). Running stable and running beautifully. Buttery smooth, as advertised, and zero bloatware.<br/><br/>I have no complaints on this purchase. Turbo charging rocks, wireless charging rocks. Having a DPI so small that it makes the Note 4 feel like it's wasting screen space is beyond awesome. Especially since I use my phone as a tiny workstation (when I connect my bluetooth keyboard) and use my office apps or any other work related apps.<br/><br/>Phone fits snugly in my pockets and the round back doesn't create an awkward flat surface within my jeans.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this phone for anyone who can handle a big phone.
I received my first phone last Friday, set it up with ATT and proceeded to explore my new phone and that's when I discovered that every time I hit contacts it would flash and not open.  I reset the phone and still the same issue so I called tech support.  We tried a few more things and it was determined that it was a hardware issue and that I should talk to Motorola.  They also advised me that he did not know if it was under warranty because I bought it from Amazon.  He transfer me and before I could talk to the tech we were cut off.  I decided to call Amazon and before I could finish my story they had a new phone on it's way and a return slip for the faulty one.  I received my new phone on Sunday. Kudos to Amazon for the awesome customer service.  This is one of the reasons I am a loyal customer.<br/><br/>For point of reference I went from an iphone 4s to a fire phone and now to the Nexus 6.  I love this phone and have already ordered a second one for my husband.  It's fast, easy to use, the screen is beautiful and I love the front facing speakers in fact there isn't much I don't like about it.  The size is a little cumbersome but I think I will be able to get use to it.  After reading a million reviews that said it was huge it was actually smaller than I thought it would be when I unboxed it.  The one thing that I really dislike is where the on/off/volume buttons are.  I have turned off the phone numerous times because it's where I tend to hold my phone.  This is going to take some adjustment.  The Nexus 6 has won me over to android permanently.  Good bye Apple!  I am a little concerned about the warranty and whether the phone actually comes with a warranty.  Right now I'm a very happy Nexus owner!
I purchased this phone to replace a Nexus 5. Though the Nexus 5 is still quite serviceable, I needed a larger display for several reasons. The Nexus 6 is definitely large and it is a good idea to try one out at a carrier boutique before-hand.<br/><br/>Like many reviews will state, the size is the advantage and disadvantage of this phone. You will need to either use two hands or get familiar with "pinky ledge" and other big phone techniques. For some, this may preclude using this phone while driving (which one shouldn't be doing anyway) and one-handed usage definitely takes some practice.<br/><br/>The advantages of a large phone depends on your usage. For me, I had difficulty reading PDFs or e-books on my Nexus 5 without lots of zooming/scrolling. Web pages, even the mobile versions, had the same issues and often I ended up going to a laptop to look up some information. These problems go away with a large phone and given the trade-off between carrying a phone and a tablet and having an oversized phone, the latter is more convenient.<br/><br/>So the size out of the way, there are some good things about the Nexus 6. It has an excellent display that's bright and responsive. The advantage of these "retina" displays seemed pointless to me until I had a chance to use a Google Cardboard device. If you're not familiar with it, the Cardboard is a low-cost, high-tech virtual reality headset that puts the phone display two inches from your face and magnifies the image. Versus lower-resolution screens, the Nexus 6 still looks smooth at that distance. Next, battery life is excellent. I can go all day and still have charge left over when I return home. It can also fast-charge so in ten minutes it can charge enough for a few hours of usage.<br/><br/>There are some niggles. The camera is good but not excellent. Also, I wish Android would allow some customization of the navigation buttons as this would make one-handed use easier.<br/><br/>Lastly, Android 5.1 is just about to be released as I write this. It supposedly speeds up this phone. Once it gets pushed to this phone I will update the review.
This is a great phone for half the price Verizon is selling it for (as of October 2015). It is pure Google Android Lollipop 5.0 - mine just updated this week to Marshmallow 6.0 - with no Verizon or Samsung bloatware. You can get the Verizon apps you need at the Playstore.<br/>It scared me a little getting it activated, it takes some time for everything to "sync up" I guess. Following the instructions on the Verizon site everything went perfect except getting the Verizon cloud backup of my contacts to download was very slow and awkward. The Cloud app menus are not the best. But after an hour or so - as I recall -  all was well. The next day the phone was perfect but then the following evening suddenly all my contacts were gone! I went to the VZ site on my PC and looked in my Cloud drive. I found all of my contacts in the trash can! Bizarre. I undeleted them and started "backup" - the wrong word in my opinion - and they were restored to my phone again. Since then, about three weeks the phone has been flawless. No stars deducted for what I assume was a Verizon issue.<br/>Great battery life, superior to S5. Great, large display and no cheap easy to chip plastic chrome around the glass like on the Samsungs.<br/>If the description says model 00636NARTL it is fully Verizon 4G-LTE compatible. Verizon will give you a nano Sim card for free at a company store or mail it to you if you request one online. I used the chat feature and the rep knew exactly what I needed and had no problem at all with this not being an "official" Verizon phone. We are apparently in a new era where Verizon is cutting rates and becoming more customer friendly. Finally!
Awesome device. The best android so far. I have an iPhone 6 and a note 4. The iPhone is great but has a lot of restrictions for someone not from the apple eco-system.<br/><br/>Note 4 has 53 preinstalled apps that cannot be removed. Touch Wiz eats more that 2 gb of ram all the time. Wont be an issue for an avg. user.<br/><br/>I needed more. So, the nexus 6 is awesome and I have 1.5 gb of ram free after having all my apps like 30 of the open. Premium feel and built.<br/><br/>A bit overpriced by Amazon but smooth and fast delivery as always.<br/><br/>=================================================================================================<br/>Update: 5/21/2015<br/><br/>Almost 2 months with my Nexus 6 - Here is what I have<br/><br/>Still fast. Good overall performance.<br/><br/>Android Updates: Haven't seen 5.1 even though Nexus is supposed to get it as soon as it comes out.<br/>Camera: Slow to launch, operation is slow. Even after you have clicked a photo, 2 mins later it is still processing the HDR mode photo.<br/>Accelerator: Fails every now and then. Solution is to clear cache in boot mode once a week.<br/><br/>Battery:  Major Drawback<br/>My Usage Profile: Medium  (No gaming, casual camera use, mostly mails, browsing net - 2 hrs a day)<br/>With my usage (Medium to Heavy) I normally get 10 to 11 hours on any phone I have used. This one dies in 5 hours. I have to charge it twice or thrice a day.<br/><br/>Contacted Motorola support 3 times. - Was directed to a moto site on "Tips to save battery - turn off gps, wifi, btooth when not is use"<br/> - Well Moto - If I have to do that all day, why do I have a smartphone. I never did that on any of my phones.<br/><br/>No resolution yet. Have been asked to try an alternate charger. Seems have to switch to Samsung pretty soon. Wasted 700K<br/><br/>===================================================================================================<br/>Update: 06/06/2015<br/><br/>Finally, what I wished for. Changing back to '5 STARS'<br/><br/>My last update was '2 STARS' for bad battery n loads of problems: Had Motorola replace it.<br/>The 2nd one which arrived was even worse. This time the problem was - Random reboots every 15 to 20 mins.<br/><br/>Got my 3rd replacement from Moto last week with 5.1.1 on it (The original from amazon had 5.0)<br/><br/>This is perfect<br/>- holds charge for like 12 - 14 hours (I am a power User)<br/>- No reboots at all<br/>- fixed more minor issues:<br/>  Camera is faster<br/>  Even Wireless charging is faster than before.<br/><br/>Couldn't be happier! I guess its 5.1.1. that helped.
What can I say, it's a nexus phone and it's dan and night difference from my old Samsung phone. Although, 6" screen is a little too big. Only problem I have with this $350 phone is the charger's cable length, it is too short, 3' maybe.
I'ts not as fast as I expected for a considerably expensive phone, and the size... I knew it would be big, but everyone around thinks I'm using a tablet and they're surprised when I tell then is a phone...<br/><br/>Good nevertheless!
by far the best phone out, just unlock the bootloader root it and then run a custom rom and youre good to go! as far as size goes you shouldnt lower the grade based on size.  its a large phone...you should have known that before buying
Ordered mine from Motorola about a month and a half ago (64GB version). It is enormous and fast and perfect for the person who doesn't want to carry their tablet everywhere but wants more space than a regular smartphone. My Nexus 7 was a nightstand paper weight most days, but my Nexus 5 personal phone came with me everywhere. However, since it was not that much bigger than my work phone, there wasn't much to be gained in carrying both. I can without a doubt say that I would never carry a phone larger than this, and my guess is that any phone larger than 6 inches will just not sell. This phone runs right up to the edge of absurd.<br/><br/>I carry my iPhone 5c for work and my personal number is with Google Voice, so I have the option of carrying either phone outside of work hours. Most of the time I have both with me, but the size is such that there will be times when I miss the one-handed operation that made certain easily doable tasks when doing other things like texting someone while walking the dogs, changing a song while driving difficult or dangerous with this phone. So, in those cases I'm mostly still reaching for my iPhone. But, overall, it's so much nicer if you're doing tasks over a long period of time than staring at a small screen.<br/><br/>If I quit my job, I'd easily manage carrying this as my one and only everyday phone. Overall, the handling trade-offs are worth the additional real estate, but it may not be for everybody. In a perfect world it would have an SD slot and secondarily a removable battery, but you'll never get that from Google. I justified the steep price by selling both my Nexus 7 and Nexus 5 and recouped most of the cost.
Google Nexus 6 is the best phone on the market! No bloatware, not tied to carrier updates, and it's all Google branding. Smooth as silk navigation, great transitions, powerful processor, and plenty of RAM. Nexus is king of the field!
I am sold on never buying any other phone but the Nexus. The lack of bloatware makes this phone extremely appealing. Motorola's customer support was excellent as well when I dropped it from a third story building. Highly recommend.
The only one thing that might you doubt: it is a little too big. The rest is perfect: nice screen, good battery life, nice camera, good bare bones Android, snappy processor and a great experience as a whole. Nice feeling in hand
Works great with T-Mobile I decided to sideload the Marshmallow update versus wait for the OTA. Wifi Calling works great and visual voicemail is built into the operating system. Not too big wouldn't go back to a smaller phone.
Shut up dont over think it just buy it. I was on the iOS grind for 3 generations of iPhones, I wanted something different after I got my iPhone 6 plus and I got this instead. This is the best thing ever, I love it, no regrets.
Battery life superior to Samsung
Absolutely in love with this phone. Not only does it have a great price (obviously now is the time to get it, since 5X and 6P are right around the corner), but it has some of the best specs around. Fast charge is a huge plus.
How can you go wrong with a Nexus device? Clean interface, no carrier or manufacturer crapware. Battery life was better then my Note 3.<br/><br/>Only problem? No Otterbox or lifeproof cases because it is a niche device.
Excellent product. Works great.
Great phone. it's fast and powerful. the screen is beautiful. the battery lasts forever. I like the design of the phone. Google's equivalent of SIRI is amazing, I occasionally speak to my phone to find a place on a map or to text someone if I'm feeling lazy or wish to feel like a tool.<br/><br/>Concerning it's size: I am sitting down typing this with the phone in my pocket and don't even feel it. That said, it won't fit in skinny jeans, so you are going to have to make a choice in what you value more :)<br/><br/>My complaints have more to do with the OS with lots of small annoying things. There's no "enter" button on the sms keyboard, which sucks since I like to format my messages before I send them. SOOO ANNOYING!! the autocorrect is mediocre at best. The notifications cover stuff that I'm doing every now and then. Not a huge deal, but I get mildly irritated every time things don't go perfectly well. I mean, it's $700, that's the price of a laptop. This stuff should have all been figured out.<br/><br/>Concerning the specs: on paper, this thing lays the smack-down on the Iphone 6 plus's candy ass. Don't get the Iphone, it's a rip off compared to this magnificently stylish beast, while the android ecosystem is open and lets you do whatever you want with your phone. The drawback to not creating a vacuum / walled garden like Apple is that their OS's UX is inferior. I still would buy this phone 100 times over compared to the Iphone.<br/><br/>Google, make your OS better, and collect 5 stars.
I really expected it to be smaller than it actually is. My fault after all. But the quality, design, as well as its features are incredible. If you are used to handle 6-inch cellphones, you will definitely love it!
Switching from iPhone to Android. I'm only about a month into having it.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Great camera, bought it right before vacation in Hawaii, love the quality of the photos I took<br/>Fantastic large screen, awesome for video apps and watching movies<br/>Plenty of storage<br/>Solid manufacturing, feels nice and bulky like the size suggests<br/>Battery charge is awesome, (compared to iPhone) can go an entire day off full charge and not worry about having to charge<br/>Games run smooth, downloaded a few high hardware requiring games and they run smooth<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Can take awhile to get used to the size<br/>Can't get 4G after talking to AT&T; because I didn't buy it through them<br/>Front facing camera is lacking<br/>Take the size into account, doesn't fit easily into pockets<br/>Default messaging app is garbage, can't send MMS, had to hit the app store for a better one (it came with ads), iMessage is better<br/>Sometimes crashes<br/>Long load up (but if you keep it charged it's not an issue)<br/>Pricey, not sure if it's worth the pricetag buying it without an upgrade<br/><br/>All in all I'm pretty happy with it after switching from Apple. If you have the money I'd say it's worth it, but I feel you're really paying for the size. I love having video on my phone. However, I feel you can get the same quality camera and battery life on some other android phones. I'd suggest going to your phone store and playing around with the options.
After coming to the Nexus 6 from the LG Optimus L90, I feel like I've come back into the cutting edge for phone devices. The screen is simply stunning, and the performance is what you would expect from a flagship phone, but with Amazon's current price point, it's a no-brainer. I have experience only one moment of slow-down, and that was when I was running a ridiculous number of apps. Everything is buttery-smooth in operating the device. Great camera, especially considering the wasteland from which I was coming from.<br/><br/>I have not tested the latest operating system, Marshmellow, yet, but the phone runs stock Lollipop extremely well and I do not expect Marshmellow to run poorly on this device given the specs that it boasts.<br/><br/>The only real issue that I have had with this phone is the battery life, but if you aren't as heavy a phone user as I am (and you probably aren't--I have a problem), you will be able to get through a work day on a charge. The charger that Motorola has provided also charges the phone extremely quickly, so if you just plug in the phone for 15-30 minutes, you'll be pretty much back up to 70-85% to get you back over the hump.<br/><br/>You might want to wait for a 6P price drop or just get the 6P now, but this is really a stunning phone and if you want to save a few dollars, go ahead and order this incredible phone. It's the best phone I have ever owned.
Fantastic device that worked just as expected. Clean stock install done on it with Marshmallow and it flies! I bought a 6P but returned it because this phone suits my needs and is $200 cheaper!
A disclaimer: I am not a phone buff. I'm just a regular gal who needed a new phone. Review possibly a bit biased in this phone's favor since I left behind a much, much worse phone.<br/><br/>Things for other regular joes and gals to know:<br/>- This phone has a smooth curved back. This means it's going to spin around in place a lot when you have it lying flat on tables. I'm thinking a case would help this.<br/>- I regularly get the phone turned upside down leading to problems remembering where the volume/power buttons are on the side. Top and bottom aren't quickly distinguishable at a glance. Minor annoyance, just means you might spend some time fumbling for buttons, especially when the aforementioned problem gets the phone spinning around.<br/>- Space! And how! I'm installed all the apps I want and I laugh at how much space I've got left over. I came from a phone with like 2GB storage, though, so this feels like a mansion.<br/>- Speaking of size, it is a HUGE phone. Ladies, there's a good chance it won't fit in your front pockets; it doesn't fit in mine. It's not so large that you can't hold it though.<br/>- Battery life is sufficient. I can play music on it throughout the workday without issues and make it home with ~25% charge (only on wifi, cell data will drain it to about 10% by the time I leave work).<br/><br/>This is day two with the phone, more thoughts as I continue to use it.<br/><br/>Two weeks later update: I catch myself frequently saying that I love this phone. I do. It's a lovely phone. The size actually makes it that I'm using it in place of my laptop in some situations.
Ordered mine a few days ago from Amazon but I'm sending it back for a few reasons:<br/><br/>1. there is a strange line mark on my screen from the middle of the screen to the top. It's not visible when you clean the screen, but when running the finger on the screen that portion of the screen immediately shows the scuff mark. Looks like something heavy was placed on the screen for a while leaving a scuff.<br/>2. When updating to 5.1.1 out of the box with nothing set, no apps downloaded, the phone rebooted and upon starting an error appeared "UI stopped working," which pretty turned the phone into a soft brick. No amount of restarting fixed it.<br/>3. Had to call customer service and they instructed me how to go into recovery mode, and clean the cache. Didn't work.<br/>4. Called CS again, they instructed me how to restore the phone to factory default, took about 1.5 hours for the phone to complete. It stayed in an erase window for a very long time.<br/>5. Finally completed, and updated to Android 6.0. A few hours later I noticed the scruff mark on the screen.<br/>6. Screen is very dim outside.<br/>7. Screen isn't as bright as my Note 4.<br/>8. System is light years ahead of anything else out there. Very fast and responsive<br/><br/>It's a great phone. Worked very well, but I'm definitely not keeping a lemon.
I absolutely love this phone! Excellent build quality, stock android, great value for the $$$ and it works great with Project Fi. The only con is I am still waiting for Android 6.0 upgrade.
if your into pure android then this is the phone to get I just love it its the best android phone i have used so far, must say battery life is weak but supper charge feature makes up for it
VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PHONE.<br/><br/>Let me start this by saying that I upgraded from a HTC One M7,  That being said there was a lot of room to grow and I did a lot of research before I settled on this. Let me say first that if the size is an issue for you that you will get used to it pretty quickly,  I bought the iBlason dual layer case for it so it went straight into the case to save the screen from prints and scratches. Okay, the first thing is the screen, beautiful and big and bright but can also be the one ting that kills it for you, if you keep the brightness up you will KILL your battery. Next is the battery, of you close your apps and run a few cleaners once or twice a day you will make a solid day with no problem.  The features are, up to you to know, if you want the ambient display then keep it on but it brings the batter down faster.  The look and feel is great the phone is solid and somewhat heavy, and with the case it is pretty hard to forget you have it in your pocket. To sum this all up, As long as you know how to keep the processes closed and shut down what you don't need, the phone will perform to the best level possible and take you through the day with no issues. I like it, I'd buy it again and it is exactly what I wanted. The price drop is key and you just can't beat this phone for the price.
Great price and fast delivery. The phone was a little large at first but I quickly adjusted.  After having the Nexus 6 for about a month I am really happy with the quality and features.
Price was the main factor I purchased this phone. 6" is a little big but not too big compared to note series. And form factor is almost the same as an iPhone 6 plus.<br/><br/>- The downfall is, this is 32 Bit processor, now android devices are moving towards 64 bit., this is something android took longer compared to iPhones.<br/><br/>- Other is I would have loved if there was a microSD card tray. It gives convince to expand extra space and to manage those extra files where lightning speed is not too much crucial compared to internal space.<br/><br/>- Front facing two speakers give quality sound. too bad the package does not come along with an earphone, how much does that thing really cost Google to add it to the package?<br/><br/>- It came with OS 5 lollipop, it asked me if I would like to update to 5.01, I said yes, it optimized for all default 126 apps, then another update 5.1, I said yes, same optimization again, another update 5.1.1, same thing again, and then another update, it was like never ending , why can't I just  jump to ONE last final update automatically? Androids are you listening?<br/><br/>but overall experience is good for the price. I believe the price will go more down with the launch of the new nexus in a few days.
Phone was as stated and delivered timely. Would give 5th star of the cord to charge wasn't the cheapest you could find, never worked, but why contact for another cheap broken cord.
Camera issues (could not connect to camera error). Finally updated software and fixed that but battery life was very poor. Returned.  Nexus 5x is overall better for the same price.
I had bought this worried I would have trouble activating it on Verizon, but I had no issue.  I just took it to a store and the activated it with no drama.  You may need to go to a Verizon-Verizon store, and not a reseller, though.  I didn't have to have any IMEI white-listing or anything...it just activated.<br/><br/>The phone is really big, and I really like it.  The screen is great, it's quite speedy, and it doesn't have any carrier garbage on it.  I had heard the battery life wasn't so great, but it beats the Galaxy S4 I had in normal use.  It doesn't last nearly as long as my work iPhone 5S on standby, but the  iPhone battery is only OK if you actually use it.<br/><br/>The phone's design is really nice.  It has the aluminum frame and a plastic back.  It feels premium enough, maybe not Apple-premium, but close enough.  The software is pretty nice...stock Android beats the other manufacturer and carrier flavors hands down.  Plus, this phone will get updates quickly.<br/><br/>The only con so far is screen brightness when outside.  My Galaxy OLED screens did well here, but this OLED really doesn't.  It is a limited use case, though.  As to size, I don't think you can go wrong on either, but I got 64GB so I could hold plenty of songs during travel.
The battery is one of the best out currently (3/17/15). And the size is easy to get used to. Has a beautiful screen, and camera and is unbelievably smooth. 10/10 would recommend.
Awesome phone, super fast
Very clear bright picture and grafics...easy to read for my I should be wearing my readers eyes.  I am new to the Android platform, but I am really enjoying getting to know it.
So far I am very happy with the Nexus 6. No issues, nice large screen and can be upgraded to Marshmallow OS. Its all Google with no  unnecessary applications preinstalled.
Decent phone. Only gripe is the camera can't autofocus when taking video. This is a problem for fast moving video as it will be a blur. You have to stop and let it focus.
This is my first Nexus device and I love it.<br/><br/>I received the 6.0 Update quickly and this improved battery life. The device is responsive (at least with my Nova Launcher settings I have no issues) and the 32 GB of memory are more than enough for my spotify music and the apps I use.<br/><br/>Some games such as Hearthstone might lag at times (not sure if this was a thing of the past before I played a few matches or if it's the game/resolution that is too demanding).<br/>The camera takes some amazing pictures (if you set it at 13 MP with the 3:4 aspect ratio). The camera software will also improve according to Google so the quality might improve in time as well.<br/>I have not tried making any videos, but I know it can record 4k@30FPS.<br/><br/>While I was uncertain if the size will be too much for me, I can say that within a few days I got used to the big screen, and in a few weeks any discomfort completely disappeared (I do have big hands and I don't mind using the device with 2 hands for the most part).<br/><br/>The AMOLED screen is great for watching youtube videos and maybe some Netflix while the stereo frontal speakers do a nice job with the sound as well.
This phone is Awesome. All of my smart phones (in the past) have been iphones. I have been happy with them and Apple (but not AT&T;) so after looking I decided to try Google Fi. I could have bought a phone from them, but Amazon offered a $100 better deal. I could spend the same amount and get a better phone (which I did) or get the same for $100 less. Having said that... The phone is great, the screen size is great (I'm a little older and the extra real estate is great for these eyes). In addition the features are excellent (never really used SURI) so I'm not sure there is a replacement for that, but everything else seems to be nearly the equivalent of the iphone. It takes a little more plodding (since this is my first android) and I had to google some of the workings/settings. I will not need to do that in the future. The iphone is better set up for the beginner, but if you have been around a while, you can make your way through this with a little patience and common sense. Google FI sent me a programed sim. You have on a wi-fi network to activate it. But everything worked fine. My bill is now $30 dollars (ish) as opposed to $90. 50 or 60 dollars a month adds up real quick.
I just got it and its big! Since I never use one hand to navigate around any of my other cellphones over 5.0  I feel a good case will help me with my grip. That's the bad. I looked at the LG G4 I really liked the camera and camera app it came with.  For me it was really a question of camera, size 5.5, and display qualities of one against the "Video and Music" experience, vanilla android and getting the updates quickly that made me go with the Nexus 6. After receiving my Nexus 6 I bought the paid app Manual Camera. What a great experience using the wheel to change the variables manually. Amazon Prime preset music play lists were awesome as well as video from other content rich providers (YouTube, WatchESPN, Netflix) etc. I down loaded the nexus media importer app since I have the USB OTG cables to use either with my "flash drives" or "SD card/USB drive" with the Nexus 6. Battery life is as expected so with a fast charger and one portable QUALCOMM 2.0 charger to boot I decided to let the pedal to the metal and go with the true experience of the Nexus 6 (64 GB) play out. So far so good. Will update at a later time.  Price $399. Excellent...
Love the phone and the battery life. The only thing I don't like is that there is no sd card support.  Besides that it's a great deal and and an outstanding device.
I really like this phone so far. No LED notification though?? Anyway its definitely not for everyone but for people with big hands you'll love this phone/tablet.
Very pleasant shopping experience! nexus6 battery life is very satisfied, but poor at low screen brightness when the color, of course, this is a problem amoled！
The size is what I was looking for. I don't own a PC or a Laptop, so a large screen is very desirable. The issue I had with the Nexus 6 is that apps would just stop working, with a little message informing me of such without explanation and a few times the screen froze-up and would not respond to any prompts, not even the power button. I don't know if this behavior is common to the phone or if I just got a lemon, but I've had enough experience with bad phones to understand how frustrating it can be to try resolving the issue with tech-support, that I decided to just send the phone back and chalk it up to simply a bad experience. If an explanation for its behavior could be provided, I would be willing to try it again, but as is, I'm disappointed in Motorola, especially because it was originally a $600 phone. Maybe it's just the "pure android" experience that I'm disappointed with and would only prefer a slightly adulterated version, like my Moto X2, which I find to be a completely enjoyable and satisfactory phone. Maybe the Nexus 6P will be more user-friendly, but if not, the Moto X phones will be my preferred choice.
Even after all of my research, this phone was still larger than I expected when I finally held it in my hand. Coming from a Moto X (first gen), it's quite a size difference.<br/><br/>The battery seems to last all day with light to moderate use (text, email, web browsing) on WiFi. I'm finding i won't need to plug it in until 11 or 12pm.<br/><br/>I miss a few features from the Moto X, like gestures to open the camera and Moto assist for notifications while driving, and suppressed notifications while sleeping. Being that this is sort of a super-sized Moto X, I was a little disappointed there was no way to access those features either naively, or through the play store.<br/><br/>The curved back is a mild annoyance when the phone is resting on a flat surface. I'll try to reply to a text while the phone is on my desk, and its nearly impossible to form a single word using if gesture typing. Pressing letters, although effective, will still cause the phone to wobble if it isn't held in place.<br/><br/>Still though, its a lovely device with a smooth and responsive OS. My issues are nothing a can't adjust to.
I got this phone for my Husband as a second phone.  He use an Iphone 6 Plus and wanted an Android phone to use some of the apps that we paid for- home security etc.  He loves it.  Its pure Google, just like IOS you dont have to wait for any updates.  Its a pity that people pay over $600 for the Samsung, LG and HTCs but its full of bloatware, manufacturer and carrier both.  Also there are people who paid top dollar for last years Top Samsung ans still waiting for the latest Android 6.0 update.  His phone already got the 6.0 update and he loves it.!! This phone has a very nice OLED screen and front firing dual speakers.  Battery life is really good and reception and call quality excellent. We jumped in on the BF deal and couldnt be happier. All these phones lose value in less than a year and I'm sure todays latest and greatest will be available cheap next year.  Until then we are set..<br/><br/>The other phones which have pure google are the Motorola made MOTO models and they are also not getting any 6.0 update anytime soon. Forget about the LG nexus 5, its quite old and mediocre hardware.
This phone is outstanding.  To my surprise,  the larger size is actually an asset, and makes typing,  browsing,  and streaming,  faster and more convenient than my previous pocket phones ever could. What you lose in "cuteness"  you make up in functionality.<br/><br/>The one drawback is activation.  Verizon Customers: prepare to do battle.  This phone is unlocked,  meaning it can be assigned to any network.  But if your Verizon rep is a dud,  like mine ,  they'll tell you it can't be used.  They'll plug in your imei,  see if it's already in the Verizon network (which it won't be),  and tell you to get lost.  Never fear!  Request to speak with tech support,  or a rep that is familiar with unlocked phones.<br/><br/>All they need to do is activate a sim card in another phone (my rep used a floor model)  then transfer that sim to your phone.  Done!  You're in network.  The process  of finding a rep that knew this took about an hour,  but the actual activation takes less than a minute.<br/><br/>Given the awesomeness of this phone,  the time spent was well worth it.
It's been a week and I really am enjoying my Nexus 6. It takes great photos and they look great on the 6 inch 2K screen! Apps open and operate quickly with the fast CPU and ample memory.  Android updated to 5.1.1 and Google has said the Nexus 6 will get version 6 (Marshmallow) but no date yet.  The Nexus 6 operates on LTE Band 12 so I will get the benefits of 700MHz performance as T-Mobile upgrades the SF Bay Area! (Really looking forward to the better range and building penetration provided by band 12.)<br/><br/>It is big, coming from a 4.7 inch Lumia and just fits in a Rugged QX XX-Large NXT Heavy Duty Case with the Ringke FUSION Scratch Resistant Clear Back Drop Protection Bumper Case installed.  I also installed a TruShield Tempered Glass Screen Protector. My first glass screen protector and I will never use film again!<br/><br/>Only negative is the lack of a micro-SD card slot for additional song storage. (I have over 100 GB.) Battery performance could be better given the phone's size. I have not timed it, but less than 12 hours with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi enabled.
The Pros:<br/>1- Very good price for the features.<br/>2- Running Google's stock Android (Can be a con if you like to be in control of your phone inside out).<br/>3- Sturdy build.<br/>4- Very good dual front speakers.<br/><br/>The Cons:<br/>1- The phone is exceptionally large so unless you've held it in hand before think twice before buying.<br/>2- The phone is fingerprint magnet on the back and the screen gets really oily.<br/>3- The phone heats up quickly.<br/>4- The screen is below average and the white on the screen has pinkish tint.<br/>5- The camera is below average with a slight blur on most pictures, but it is snappy and quick.<br/>6- Running stock Android which means minimal customization options and puts google involved in every single feature you use on the phone without leaving a choice to you.<br/>7- The battery life is below average. You will need to charge your phone every 12 hours for less than average use.<br/>8- Internal speakers (phone calls) relatively low and hard to hear.
I previously owned a OnePlus One and the Nexus 6 is an improvement in almost every way except perhaps battery life, but this is more than made up for by the insanely fast charging of the Nexus 6.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- The display (big, great colors, awesome resolution).<br/>- Quick charging is a huge win and gets my Nexus 6 up to full power faster than any device I've ever owned.<br/>- Front facing speakers.<br/>- The device is fast.<br/>- No carriers to get in the way of timely OS updates.<br/>- Speaking of carriers, there is no carrier bloatware on this device.<br/>- Phone reception is fantastic. In comparison, calls on my OnePlus One were a mess and people constantly complained that they could not hear me, but on my Nexus 6, I've never had a complaint about call quality.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Battery life could be better, but this is the price you pay for having such a big display.<br/>- Display isn't as bright as I would like it to be which can be annoying on particularly sunny days.<br/>- Camera doesn't take the greatest low light shots.
Bought it from the used/refurbished section, phone was in amazing condition! Greatest buy I have made on a phone for a great price! Thank you Amazon!
Everything from this phone is flawless.<br/>Performance is great, haven't had any problem.<br/>Camera haven't tested yet but that is not my main focus when buying a cellphone.<br/>Lollipop is super fun and well designed although I would have like better a bit more customization in the app drawer (don't want to install a custom launcher for that)<br/>Screen is as sharp as it gets, won't be dissapointed.<br/>Size may be a bit huge, but that's the reason I bought it, to have a big screen for productivity and.... I read a lot of Ebooks making a sharp and big screen a must for me. (Play Books is awesome and I can even add my own epub files and have them on the Cloud for any device)<br/>Sound is a lot more powerful than Galaxy S3 and Galaxy Tab 2 7" that I had before. Just for comparisson though, I can hear music clearly while in the shower :)<br/>Everything works outside the box.<br/><br/>Only complaint is the back cover is plastic and it gets some fingerprints, isn't a deal breaker since I cleaned it and put the phone in a case.
I couldn't find someone to answer me about this phone being able to connect with MetroPCS but I went ahead and got it anyway,  IT DOES WORK YAY!!
I haven't been a big fan of Motorola since their Droid X2 many, many moons ago. In performance, hardware and android build quality I have found Samsung's Galaxy offerings to be in every way superior. The Nexus 6, however, represents Moto's 180* turn, and is the phone that is likely to be on my hip for quite some time. There are many reviews here and elsewhere online touting the specs and technical details of the Nexus 6, so I won't get into any of that for the moment, instead deferring to others who've gone to great lengths to explain the value of the 5.9" AMOLED display or Snapdragon quad-core 2.7 processor.<br/><br/>Instead I will offer the review that the average, smartphone savvy user needs - one that just tells you how well it works. Because let's be honest, impressive hardware and specs don't mean much if the device "just doesn't work all that well".<br/><br/>If you've used the Galaxy S4 or S5, the HTC One M7 or M8 or the LG G you are likely familiar with the small lags, or delays, that take ...

The Nexus 6 is the new successor to Google's very own Nexus 5 from last year. This phone aims to be bigger and better than the already awesome Nexus 5. This time Motorola has decided to give it a shot to make this pure android experience so let's see if this year they nailed Google's new flagship phone.<br/>________<br/><br/>Design: The Nexus 6 is BIG. When I say big, I mean really big. The only phone that comes close to being the size of this phone is the iphone 6 plus. This phone is almost the borderline of what determines the difference between a phone and a tablet. Motorola is really stretching the size with this phone. The phone is a lot more rounded and curvaceous from last years model but I feel like it was made this way to make gripping such a big phone a lot easier. I do like the design of the device especially the metal bezels which give it a premium feel. The keys are not mushy and give a good tactile feedback.<br/>________<br/><br/>Sound: The phone utilizes stereo front facing speakers which ma... Read more
AWESOME Phone, just buy it. I'll skip over the specs which I am sure you have already read many times over. What held me back was size but now that I have used this for two months I emphatically can say that I wish I did not wait this long before getting a phone this size. I jumped from a Samsung Galaxy S4 to this and remember all of the iPhone fan boys telling me that was too big at the time and of course now Apple is following the trend with larger devices.<br/><br/>With this phone it's easier for me to text, use apps, read (news, social, web pages, etc) and I find that I am getting more value out of my large Verizon payment every month.The phone works flawlessly, charges fast and is absolutely pocketable as long as you are not petite and wearing skinny jeans (I don't). Phone is also fast and charges very quickly with the packaged charger. Also be sure to pick up a car charger if you travel (the one that supports rapid charging) and you will never have a dead battery. This thing is always ready to go! Buy it! Do it!!!
I tried one of these from my carrier and overall it's a pretty decent phone, but with one HUGE flaw (in my opinion)... the placement of the volume and power buttons on the very center/middle of the side!  ARGH!  Exactly where my thumb rests when I'm holding a phone, causing a lot of accidental button presses that put the phone in standby mode in the middle of use, or adjusted the volume when I didn't want to.<br/><br/>Moto has done this on several of their models and I have no idea why - it's poor placement.  Other phones will place their buttons a bit higher to avoid the "grip area" - and with this phone being as large as it is, that's even more important because you need to have a tighter hand grip on it.  Couldn't get used to having to hold it toward the bottom to avoid the buttons, so took it back.<br/><br/>The screen is nice and the camera is better than average, but if you can't comfortably hold your phone then to me anyway, it's not useful.
Great screen (but could be brighter), amazing front facing speakers, great call quality, battery on Android 6.0 had been incredible, runs very fast. Camera could be better but it's not that bad, I honestly generally prefer the pictures here to the LG g4 in auto the S6 has a better camera and the 6p I replaced this with is amazing if you want a great camera get the 6p. Software runs great 6.0 is Android refined and it just works. NFC is oddly placed and makes tap to pay awkward. No fingerprint sensor. Selfie cam is absolutely terrible.<br/><br/>Get this if:<br/>You want great speakers<br/>Smooth and reliable performance<br/>Great battery (6.0 update)<br/>Big screen<br/>Respectable rear camera<br/><br/>Don't buy if:<br/>You want the best camera<br/>You take selfies<br/>It's too big<br/>Are outside alot (screen is hard to see in direct sunlight)<br/>Need the newest and best processor and fingerprint sensor<br/><br/>Buy a Nexus 6p if:<br/>You want all of the positives from both categories above.
Unlocked device that works on PagePlus/Verizon MVNOs/Verizon, etc. as well as the usual companies like AT&T; & T-Mobile or their MVNOs. The back cover was lifting near the power button on one of the two I ordered (white model). I just placed a case on it and stopped worrying about it. It is an adhesive issue - Motorola used cheap adhesive. Just lift it off and re-apply a new adhesive. Not such a big flaw that I'm going to be upset over it  on an expensive device. I could easily have returned it through Amazon, with their amazing customer service, but I didn't feel like waiting to get a new one in. This device is worth every penny, especially with it's reduced price here! You can't buy one used in mint condition from popular re-sale sites that I won't name on here! I haven't experience any overheating issues on either devices, and we are pretty intense on our wifi usage in our house. So, bottom line is that if you can get past some potentially bad adhesive, you won't be disappointed. 5 stars, no doubt!
Great Phone! It may be too big for some but you can get used to it.  The software is great but has a few bugs that I'm sure Google will fix.
Edit<br/>I was using straight talk service and they pushed an update to lollipop without telling us its an ATT special update that will lock you down to ATT without no Mashmellow updates in sight.  And now I am switching to Project Fi only to find that I don't even get any cell signal in my home while my girlfriends Nexus 6 get full signal.  Why am I buying a Nexus for locking into ATT bulls*** that I am not even using the company! I am so furious that Google will even cooperate with ATT to push this update.<br/><br/>Original review<br/>The size is ginormous. My hand cramps a bit the first few weeks using the phone. Now I am uses to a big phone, and happily it fits in my skinny jean. I wont go down any size smaller than 5.5inch screen. The evolution of smart phone is more and more evident of a necessity of daily life and its increasing the time you are interacting with them. A big screen really helps both the battery life and interaction experience.<br/><br/>If you are not crazy about the finger print sensor, which I think it will become a necessity in coming years, but not now, yet. You should go for this cheaper phone.<br/><br/>If you are taking a lot of indoor photos in dark environments and thinks finger print is a necessity now, like your bank signin supports it. Go for nexus 6p.<br/><br/>Switching from iPhone, I think the only android phone that can compare with iPhone are the Nexus. Others are only worse systems with the manufacturer try to make it harder to use and slower to even no upgrades of the OS.
Purchase Nexus 6 as a replacement to Samsung Galaxy s4 google play edition. I love it! Fast and great battery life. Fast charge is a must.
Great phone but the negative reviews regarding the battery are accurate.  With moderate use, it will not hold a charge for the entire day.
Bought it and activated it on the US Cellular network.  Went to the store and had a sales rep do it versus over the phone.  Had no issues.
This is my 1st google phone and I find it amazing. Has no troubles to download the backup information it just do it by itself. A great phone, compatible with almost anything.<br/><br/>The only issue I had to open it, was that I didn't wanted to cut the red label so I had to  unstick it carefully. I higly recommend to buy a protector case to take care of this amazing phablet. Big enough to read my books and with enough speed to run appa with no interference. Tried with different companies and it works with everyone of them.<br/><br/>Although the battery lasts only for a day, the charing time is so reliable in 15~20 mins I have 50~60% of the battery which indeed can last for almost 5 hours talking and running apps like WhatsApp, fallout shelter, Google maps, surf through the web, etc.<br/>If you want a different phone with great capacities this is the one.<br/>The voice recognition its even better than my last Motorola phone.<br/>You should really try this nexus 6.
What a great phone! I upgraded from the HTC One M8 and this is, so far, the best phone I've ever used. The 805 in here keeps things running smoothly and I've only experienced lag every so often during intensive gaming but otherwise, super smooth. Stock Android is always the way to go. You get use to the size and when you do, you will wonder why you didn't use a bigger phone to begin with. Beautiful screen, lots of real estate for media consumption. The battery life is great as I am a light user and only use it heavily from time to time. The camera is good, not the best, not the worse. I don't take a whole lot of pictures but the ones did take turned out just fine. The camera is certainly better than my other phone, the HTC M8 so I'm happy with it. I bought the Moto X Pure Edition a while ago and it was a great phone but the sound quality for me wasn't up to par. The Nexus 6 has great sound quality and loud speakers. All in all, great phone for a fantastic price.
I had Motorola Maxx which was adequate but was filled with Verizon bloatware and very poor internet performance. I took the phone to Verizon store and they put a new sim card and in 5 min it was joy. I fix computers for living and when I return a computer with pure Windows installed, I make most of my clients very happy. That is how happy I am!!! the phone is so fast and pure joy to operate and read on it since it is 6 inches. I got the 64 GB to store videos on it! You can not go wrong with price, I sold my old phone for 120. so 400-120=280 :)) plus tax of course. I was an Verizon store and they wanted to tie me up with another contract by offering 300 credit plus all their bloatware. I could not be happier. Plus you will be the first to get android 6.0. Marsh mellow. The Camera also takes very good pictures. I also paid $129 to square trade for three years of protection and cancel my Verizon $9/ month protection plan.  So the final was $410 plus some tax.
Great phone and OS. Sometimes it feels too big, but most of the time it's the perfect size for reading. This isn't a one handed phone!
No carrier apps to kill performance and battery life. It is a huge phone, but that is what I wanted so I couldn't be happier with it.
Beats the iPhone 6 Plus with ease(yep, I have both), BUT it should get better battery life and a 1080p screen would have been fine.
Have had nothing but a great experience with this phone. Quick delivery and phone is the one normally sold by Google themselves.
Picked up this phone on Black Friday for 199.99 at part of an Amazon promotion. Coming from the Nexus 5 this is a familiar experience, but just a bit more refined.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>Screen ( Size, Sharpness, and brightness)<br/>Good camera in Outdoor lightning<br/>Very responsive zero lag<br/>Turbo Charging<br/>Front Facing Speakers<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Front facing camera is a bit lower quality that expected<br/>Rear Camera in low light environments<br/><br/>This is a great for for the price. I would hesitate to get one at full price but if you can find anything under 250 its a steal. Great buy, unless you are constantly taking low light photos this may not be the phone for you.<br/><br/>P.S<br/>The phone is large but coming some a smaller device may require a bit of getting used to. It's a 2-Handed device in most situations. But in my opinion the advantages of the size far outweigh the drawbacks.
The good: great battery life, easy to modify with custom recovery and root access, fast enough for aggressive multitasking, good audio/speaker quality, solid construction.<br/><br/>The bad: too damn big, no SD card slot (!!!), headphone volume is pathetically low.<br/><br/>Note: this is not a Verizon authorized device, in that the IMEI number of the phone is not within Verizon's range. Therefore, you cannot activate it at a store. However, the phone is capable of physically communicating with the Verizon network, so all you need is for a Verizon tech to wave his magic wand and their system will accept it. But then again, when I activated account-level support for VoLTE, my voice send/receive capability cut out completely and I had to contact VZW tech support. They were able to re-enable voice calling and attributed the initial problem to the fact that I'm not using a VZW device. Who knows.
Its not what I was looking for as Battery life is #1 but its a decent phone if you don't mind charging it throughout the day
The Nexus 6 performs great, but the yellow tint on the screen is horrible.<br/><br/>Maybe I just got one from a bad batch
Yes, this phone is just a bit too big, but it's also exactly the right size. I find reading, taking and viewing pictures and videos, playing games, just about everything I find more enjoyable to do with this phone rather than my previous Nexus 5. I even find myself no longer feeling the need to look for a tablet. Even my wife, with much smaller hands, loves it. And even after I downloaded absolutely everything I wanted (except for the entire Doctor Who series), I still have 32 GB of free space!<br/><br/>I definitely recommend the Spigen Slim Armor case, as well; we bought it along with our phones for a decent price here on Amazon. It provides very good protection, good access to all ports, and I find the buttons have the perfect pressure balance: not too much pressure is required, but you won't accidentally press it by accidentally touching that side, either.
My favorite smart phone so far. Haven't used the new Nexus 6p but I like it much more than the LG G4 that I had before.
BIG..  FREAKING...  SCREEN - what else do you need to know??<br/>seriously...  it's a great price and it does everything you can think of quickly and without drama, i, however don't play games on my phone so i can't comment on that aspect but using it as a tool, and not a toy is awesome.<br/><br/>what i don't like is that it's almost too big - it fits great in my back pocket but god help you if you sit on it but really, you won't forget it's there. It's big but not an irritant and it's well balanced in my hand, the back is a little slippery so keep that in mind.<br/><br/>Some have commented on the camera but to me it's great.<br/><br/>i'm actually using it more than my nexus 7 for everyday browsing and emails.. it's that good.<br/><br/>BUY ONE NOW - especially since you can find them cheap (also, do yourself a favour and buy a case ASAP)
I loved the phone since I got my hands on it. It feels premium, durable, grippy in my hands. The marshmallow runs just buttery smooth and I don't notice any significant frame drop or lag when operating the phone. The reason why I gave it 4 stars though is because of the speakers issue I'm encountering lately. When I play any music out of the front speakers it gradually drops down . I have no idea whether it has something to do with the software or hardware. This problem really pisses me off. I wish it'd a software issue. But I made some research on the web and there are many users having this problem and they say it is a hardware issue. Other than that this phone is a beast and recommended for android fans who wants a budget friendly handset.<br/>Finally, I want a response to my feedback by Amazon to solve the problem I'm facing at the moment.
Bought the Nexus 6, what a great deal for 64 GB. I feel the new Nexus 6P is going to be great as well, but lets see how it goes first. This phone has a lot of speed and for me the screen size is great. Switching from an HTC One M7 and loved the phone but not the Sprint network.<br/>  Used to the phone to access Google Fi. Google had initial troubles porting my number from Sprint but now the phone works great. I bought the Supcase to protect the phone ( and yes with the Supcase case on charges wirelessly with the Yootech wireless charger).<br/> I feel I'm set for a while, movies are amazing on the screen. music sounds great on the speakers.<br/>Funny,  I went to Verizon initially to look at the size of Nexus 6 before purchase and Verizon employee asked if I was here to buy the Iphone 6S. I replied, not if it was free. Android works for me.
Loving this phone!! Do some research if you haven't already and you'll find that this phone rivals any of the best phones of 2015 for a fraction of the price. It isn't perfect in every category but it is entirely enough phone for the average user. I was initially concerned with the size but have quickly learned to appreciate it. The screen is amazing, it's lightning fast, and the battery is great!  The day it arrived I was immediately updated to Android 6.0(marshmallow), which was released only days prior. Being Androids flagship phone, this will always get the updates first which is a huge perk for me as I love having the newest and best! I am using this phone with Verizon prepaid (Allset) and it works great. I just walked into a Verizon store and they put the nano sim card and activated it for me, free. Would highly recommend this phone!
It is big and at first overwhelming but after awhile you get use to the size while almost every other device seems tiny.  I came from an htc one phone so my upgrade absolutely had to have the front facing speakers as well.  The sound is good quality not as good as htc one in my opinion but nontheless better than rear or side speakers.  Display was a jump from my htc so I liked that. Battery life is decent gets me about 8 hours of heavy usage and almost a full day with light usage. I did notice some few kinks such as the sound on heavy apps like mortal kombat x would come out as static also despite the snapdragon 805 processor it would lag a bit from time to time.  This isn't a phone where you'd buy just for a camera also it takes decent pics but nowhere near iPhones or galaxy's pics.  Overall great phone just not for camera work
I have had it about 3 months. Purchased when it was priced below four Benjamins... The size is huge but I have quickly gotten use to it even though I am petite and have very small hands. I use it to read a lot, like a mini tablet. I bought a case that has a strap hole and put a strap on it so I don't worry about dropping it when taking pictures. The picture quality is pretty good but the Google camera app does not focus smoothly and can be very frustrating at times. However, putting on HDR mode will allow very good shots in poor lighting. Very nice screen. The 64 GB size is great for downloading tons of videos and music. The sound is EXCELLENT- these little speakers put out better sound than my laptop that's a few years old. Strangely our household has a Nexus 5 and 9 and they both got Marshmallow already but this hasn't yet.
I love this phone, dropping one star due to it not having a removable battery.<br/>Yes the phone is large but not too large, for me it's just right, anything larger would be too large.  It fit's nice in my pocket and fit's well in my hand.<br/><br/>The speed, smoothness of the applications the phone is just beautiful.  The colors are right on, the screen is clear and sharp.  Stereo speakers on FRONT of the device, why has it taken so long for manufactures to get a clue about this?  The sound really is good and clear.<br/><br/>Love it that it's pure Android, none of the garbage and bloatware the carriers put on it.  The pure Android experience is great and there is no CarrierIQ, the spyware that causes so many issues with speed and locking up your GPS that drains the battery.<br/><br/>I very highly recommend this phone
Had to buy the carrier version 32g plebian version. Bit very beautiful fone..powerhouse if I were being honest
I'm just glad I received the US version after reading a review that said they received the international one.
Got error when trying to inßtall OTA 5.1.1 from 5.1 build LMY47D,  I installed Marshmallow and am liking it.
What I like the most about this phone is the size, resolution and processing power. The camera sucks but its not completely terrible though my Nokia lumia 925's camera was significantly better. However, the photospheres this thing takes are out of this world.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint is the battery life. If you don't use it at all, it can last you maybe a day or two. Light users will be okay with this but I'm a heavy user and I've ran out of power a couple of times while out so I had to get a second wall and portable charger. Got the Aukey brand, they seem to be okay so far and there are discounts on their FB page. The charger does charge it really fast with the Qualcomm quick charge 2.0. You can get enough juice for a few hours with just 15 minutes worth of charging.
After many years of dealing with Verizon's shady tactics (bloatware, super cookies, delayed updates, and locked boot loaders) I made the jump to my first Nexus phone. I'll tell you, this phone is amazing. First, stock Android is super fast and efficient. I love getting updates the day they come out (I am already on the latest and greatest Android 6.0 which came out a week ago). I rooted my phone just because I can. The display is a 6" quad HD, its so crisp and I love the size. It's very big, but you get used to it. I'll take the perks of a 6" display for its clumsiness. Also, a little mentioned awesomeness is the front facing speakers, they're great. Battery life is sweet too.<br/><br/>Overall a great phone, and will gladly upgrade to the 6P next year.
Going from a Galaxy S3 to this was just ridiculous. At first, turning on the screen felt like I was sitting at an IMAX theater. Screen looks just incredible.<br/><br/>Feels great in my hand. Battery lasts multiple days of heavy use, usually, and quick charge really lives up to its name even if the battery didn't last quite long.<br/><br/>There is NO substitute for the pure android experience of Nexus phones. Most manufacturer's insist on cramming the OS full of their own crap no one needs or even wants - Stock 5.1.1 (which this will upgrade to very shortly after you're using it) is snappy and fantastic.<br/><br/>There is nothing any other phone has that I can see myself wanting. If you're ok with the enormous display size, this device will not disappoint.
Awesome phone but I still have to get used to having no removable battery, ir blaster or sd card slot Ò_Ó
best Android phone I've ever had. Big screen easy to read easy to use. No bloatware absolutely love it.
I grabbed this phone because I generally like Nexus products, wanted an AMOLED screen and really liked the idea of the always listening Google services (enhanced Google services). I have not quite narrowed down the source of the issue, but for some reason the latent/dsp driven hotword detection is a damn sight less precise than the standard (active) "Ok Google" activation. That said, quite environments (by real standards) are deemed to be too noisy by the voice engine training app, so I suspect the sensitivity of the microphone might be a little heightened.<br/><br/>I like the phone, but with the Motorola X Pure and the other 2 upcoming Nexus devices this is not quite as good as one might hope/expect.<br/><br/>Ninja edit: The screen is awesome (I really like AMOLED)
I'm very happy with my nexus, the screen size is perfect. It does everything I need and then some.
Pretty good, only complaint are position of the volume buttons and occasional overheating. I found that the volume buttons are always getting in the way when I need to grab the device. It is also a nuisance if you need to clamp the device using a vehicle windshield mount. Mine has to be manually modified to fit the phone. During charging and sometimes when a lot of things are going on the phone trends to heat up quite a bit.<br/>Last thing is the curved back although aesthetically pleasing prevents interactions with the device lying flat on the table. Using the key pad this way is cumbersome and error prone. This also leads to instability when mounted using those conventionally designed windshield mounts.
Amazing nexus 6. been waiting for this for a long time and this came out just in time for my pay.
After over a month of use, I'd  I say that the nexus 9 is a solid option for anyone willing to try a big phone.  I had a OnePlus One before this and the only reason I switched w because of the lack of lte  bands in the One.  When I first got the phone, I was a little disappointed with the entire package.  The software was glitchy,battery life was terrible, and the battery saving mode made the phone pretty much unusable because of how slow it got.  Since then, I manually installed android M on my phone and it has been great.  The phone easily lasts me for a day or day and a half with amazing stand by times.  The camera app launches pretty fast and pictures are awesome.  I think it's a great buy.
I ordered this phone not long ago i never was much into motorola but i decided to give this a try. It was actually recommended to me and since my previous 2 phone died on me. I wanted to give motorola a try. So far its been running and performing way better than my galaxy s4 and my lg g2 which both of those phones gave out on me and they were fairly new as well. Im not too happy about the camera though my lg g2 took photos with much better resolution and in dark areas as well. The camera on this phone takes pictures too dark but thats not really an issue for me. I rate it 5 stars for its speed and performance. Delivery was fast as well. Actually arrived before the expected date. Thanks amazon!
Exactly as expected.<br/>Fast (Really fast) and with a long battery life.<br/>Great phone.
Great Phone, worked with Verizon out of the box, just put in my sim and it works!
At $350, this is without a doubt a 5 star product. At it's original price of $650 when first release with all of the bugs Lollipop had, it probably wasn't. Either way, I've been very happy with the performance of this phone. Battery life was what I would consider average, but after installing the 5.1.1 update it seems to have improved. The size, as most reviews state, definitely takes some getting used to, but the screen is very nice and a worthwhile trade-off. If you are coming from a Samsung Galaxy, or an LG G4, you probably won't be super impressed, but it is decent and HDR+ is fantastic. I'd definitely take a chance on it, you won't be disappointed.
Great phone for its price that I payed for, which is $260.  My wife needed a new phone so i decided to wait for black Friday. I was very lucky to catch this sale because it sold out really fast. I have a LG G3 that my wife will be using now, because I thought the Nexus 6 would be too big for her. I still think the LG G3 is more polished phone than this, in terms of little features like: different wallpaper for lock screen, customized icons, tap to unlock, etc. I would not buy this phone for its original price. But the specs are really good. If you like watching movies/videos, play games on a huge screen, the this phone will get the job done and more.
So far I am very pleased with this phone.  Keep in mind that I have only owned the phone for a week so far.  Will update this review after I have had more time with phone.  I am on T-Mobile, so just inserted SIM and the phone was ready to go.  So far here are my pros and cons.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1. Good battery life.<br/>2. Excellent speakers.<br/>3. Love the display (the phone is not too big).<br/>4. Not loaded with bloatware like my previous Samsung.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1. The battery is not designed to be user changeable, some of us like to keep a phone for more than two years. Five stars if you could.<br/>2. Screen protector not pre installed. I suck at installing them.  Good thing wife is an expert at it.
I was a little worried about the size of this phone when I purchased it and you probably are too since you're reading reviews, but rest assured: after using this phone for a couple weeks, I'm extremely pleased with the size of the screen. Everything looks great! A huge viewfinder for pictures, plenty of space for web pages, and just more real estate for all your favourite apps. Just make sure your pockets are big enough!<br/><br/>I really like everything else too. The pure android OS is really fast and intuitive, optical image stabilisation makes for great photos, and multitasking is super fast with the great specs. You're gonna love this phone!
Amazing phone. I have been buying budget smartphones off Amazon for a year now and they keep breaking. Finally buy this flagship phone and it's amazing. Specs are still in competition with this years flagships even though it's been out for a year. It's fast, fluid, powerful, and you can't beat the PURE ANDROID experience. The animations and design are flawless. The phone itself is just exceptional. The display is bright, large, and insanely crystal clear. The build of the phone is beautiful. The back is smooth but grippy and with the small bezels on the front panel, it looks sleek and smooth all around. Buy this phone. Don't consider it. Buy it.
The phone works great and wow, what a beautiful display.  It is big but didn't feel so big that it was awkward or difficult to use.  I always carry my phone in my pocket and had no problems there.  Where the rating takes a hit is in the fact that the first phone I received went right back after discovering that the headphone jack wasn't working correctly and then after having and enjoying the replacement for about 2 weeks I noticed that the back cover was coming off!  Ughh!  Even after all that I still love the phone and decided to keep it.  Picked up a replacement back cover for $10.  Easier than having to go through the return process again.
I gave the Nexus 6 5 stars because it is truly an awesome device! The 5.96" AMOLED Display is beautiful, the Dual Stereo Speakers sound great and are super loud, the SD 805 coupled with 3GB of ram is super fast and snappy, and 32gb of storage standard is plenty for the average user. I chose the Nexus 6 over the newer 5X and 6P! I like the design and build of the Motorola Nexus 6. Also, Qualcomm dropped the ball bad with the SD 808 and 810. I refuse to buy a device with either! I will wait for the 820, which is going to be an excellent SOC!<br/><br/>I however, received a device that would not power on unfortunately. It happens though!
So I really love this phone, the feel, the screen, the system, everything about it basiclly. The only I really don't love is the size. however I'm sure that will change as I continue to use it more and more. However the one real issue I had with the phone is the software it shipped with is Build LNX07M which a developers build and not a production build. This means I was not eligible for OTA updates and manually had to update it. However since it was a nexus this was a fairly painless process and once it was over I really got back to enjoying the phone
Coming from a Virgin Mobile Galaxy S3, I love this phone. Haven't had much lag and it's been amazing for me. Big plus for me is the quick charging and screen size. I got used to the screen size in 2 days. After that, my s3 just seems too small for me. The screen is great for reading. No issues for this phone running on 6.0 Marshmallow with Project Fi! Although I wanted the 6P, I really don't regret buying this phone. Price was a steal for its size and performance! It's cheap if you REALLY compare to every other contract/no contract smartphone.. Only downside I have about this phone is that the camera doesn't focus in some areas..
**Update - The crackling sound from headset keeps happening during calls. Its random but I've noticed at least 4-5 times in last one week. Once started, I've to restart the phone. I'm sending it back to Amazon for a replacement, As mentioned below, everything else worked like a charm.<br/>**************<br/>I liked this phone a lot. There are some negative remarks about the size but believe me once you are used to it (1-2 days), you will never go back to a smaller device. The screen looks amazing and the phone is very fast. However, last couple of days, I've been hearing a rattling noise from the speaker. It come while making calls even if its in handset mode. Not sure if it is a hardware issue. I restarted once and it stopped happening but after a day it started again. Its pretty random - once or twice a day and is very disturbing. I'll keep it for some more days to see if the issue re-appears. I'll share the feedback soon.
Great phone without having the provider baking useless apps into it. Love this phone.
Just for $199 a nexus 6,  wow!!!!  Best deal in town.  I Highly recommend this phone
Not the best but generally good, with good camera quality, processing speed, screen size is suitable for gaming and watching movie. Anyway you may feel annoyed if you need to get crowded on public transport every day morning coz of the size. The most important thing for me is the system update of Nexus device. Already at the android 6.0 now. Loves Motorola a lot. Hongkongers seems not much care about this brand.<br/><br/>This phone is selling at HK by Google Play store at about US $550 and is surely not a reasonable price. Here at Amazon is much more attractive & I have recommended this to some of my friends.
I've been a loyal Samsung supporter for a long time. Jumping to the Nexus was only a bit scary because it's jumping back to a Motorola, which I have not been too happy with previously. I do have to say however, if there was no logo on the back of the phone, I would never have known this was a Motorola phone. I'm not sure if that's a compliment or a let down to their company, but I am enjoying the simplicity, sleekness, speed, beauty, and screen size of this phone. I highly recommend this to any one wanting a quality phone for a ridiculously good price compared to others of the same specifications.
Awesome I love this phone! 64gb for $400 great deal,  great phone. I'm a power user and have had to charge twice a day surfing the Internet multi tasking and basically on for 4 hrs at a time. Not the greatest energy efficiency but what a nice screen, and the charger works faster than regular ones.<br/>I got sick of waiting for HTC to make another nice large phone but after 3 years Oh well. It is worth the change my wife's Nexus 5 is a great phone so why not Vanilla Android What a great change.<br/>Thanks Google and Motorola what a nice phone.<br/>Also Thank you Amazon for the awsome price.
I'm absolutely loving this phone, at this price it must be the best option around
Great as soon as I learn how to use it.  I received black & wanted midnight blue.
Overall, it is a great phone.  I was worried that the size would be uncomfortable when making phone calls but that is not the case. (I have average size hands for a male) I have not used the camera much so I can't speak to that. Sound quality is good when making phone calls, browsing speed is very good, the front facing speakers are great for a phone (why don't all phones have that) and the screen is very good. The only real complaint I have is the placement of the physical keys to unlock the screen and control the sound.  I find myself occasionally hitting those keys on accident.
<br/><br/><br/>This was my dream phone, primarily due to it's big screen for watching videos and content. Upon receiving it, I realized it's even better than I'd thought! Furthermore, with vanilla Android and fast, guaranteed updates, it's a phone I will continue to enjoy over time. At this price, this phone is a steal due to its powerful internal hardware and smooth software experience. Keep in mind though that the camera isn't good for nighttime photography, but then which phone ever is?
Phone is fast with a beautiful screen and good battery life. I have very large hands, and this phone is on the upper limit of comfortable phone size, so your mileage may vary, but this has replaced my Samsung Galaxy, my tablet, and most of the functions of my laptop in one device. It is a little awkward to hold during phone calls, but I've had it for two days so I'm sure I will get used to it. The latest android seems faster, smoother, and more bug-free than my last phone.<br/><br/>TLDR: it's a really big phone, if that's what you want, you can't go wrong with this one.
i went from note 4 to this phone and love it, nothing beats stock android in terms of user experience. my only real gripe about this phone is the battery life. for such a large phone, it should have a better battery life than it does; the note 4 certainly sets the standard in that regard. also, some chargers/usb cables will not work work with this phone; you will see the charging icon on the top right, but your phone will not actually charge! this was the case when using my note 4 charger, but i haven't had any issues using the quick charger than came with the nexus 6.
I seem to have problems with it dropping connection to VZ. Not while I am in a phone call, but it looses the signal and data, switching airplane mode off and on does not work, must be rebooted. It is LARGE, until you hold it in your hand, it is hard to imagine the size. I also have a heavy duty case so it is a little bigger but I would rather protect the phone.<br/>Other than that, the screen is great, very fast, no other problems that come to mind.<br/>If you have the screen brightness on max and text a little, browse a little, the battery will not last the day.
this is the best Android phone i have ever used, no bloatware at all. so nice
Got the US model, which is what I wanted to use on T-Mobile US.  Phone was delivered next day.  Started to receive updates once it hit the internet.  5.1.1 plus some other updates.  Works nicely.  Not the best browser experience.  Smoother on iOS.  Great phone for the price.  Band 12 LTE for T-Mobile definitely seems to make a difference vs iPhone 6 Plus with Band 12 support.  Battery life seems not so good, but that might be due to the very high res display.  All in all, a great buy for the price and nice to not have typical Android bloat from Samsung or HTC.
Personally I like the larger "phablet" sizing.  The screen is very sharp, the performance of Android "Marshmallow" on this phone is very snappy, and the battery seems to last an above average amount of time and also charges quickly with the included 15 watt charger.  I'm using Google Fi service, so I know I'll be saving a few bucks over time.  If you like the Android OS and the size of this phone (it will not fit into my pants pockets), you will like this phone.  My wife, for example, will never use this phone because she prefers Apple's IOS.
This is a great phone, and for $350, it is highly worth the cost. The screen is a bright 6 inch High Resolution 1440p screen. The speakers are dual front firing speakers, which are great for watching movies and listening to some music, a much needed upgrade from my old Samsung Galaxy S4's single rear firing speaker. Since this phone is a Nexus, this phone always gets the latest versions of Android in a timely fashion straight from Google. Overall, this phone is Fast. I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants a great phone and is on a budget.
This may be last year's model, but it is an excellent phone! Be prepared to deal with having a huge beast on your hands, but you would not need to carry a phone and a tablet. As I travel a lot, this is great since it lightens my load. In kind, it is really nice to have a nice big screen to work with. The curvature of the phone helps it fit better in my hands. However, I do notice that I rarely go one-handed with it. The speed is acceptable, and security updates are quick since one does not have to wait for mobile phone providers to get into the loop.
I came from a oneplus one. This device is a slight upgrade in all areas, except maybe not the software part because my oneplus was running on cyanogmod, which is like vanilla Android, but more customization potential. Physical issues I see are the pink hue of screen on low brightness, can be removed if disabled adaptive brightness. I keep it on, doesn't really bother me. The back cover might lose its adhesiveness and start coming off. I'm not sure if you can replace the back and solve it diy but Motorola support says warranty replacement is free.
Purchased this on Amazon at the new low price of 349.  I thought it would make a great alternative or back up to my iPhone 6 Plus.  I removed my T-Mobile sim card from the iPhone and placed it in the Nexus 6.  After several system updates, I entered the correct T-Mobile APN information and everything worked flawlessly including band 12.  Speed Test downloads are hitting up to 60 Mbps.  This phone is fast and the display is beautiful.  The bottom line is I'm loving stock android and this phone.  The iPhone is now my alternative and backup phone.
I love the phone and the natural state of Android. It was easy to sideload Marshmallow. Before upgrade from 5.1 to 6.0 no WiFi Calling, now have the option, and appears to be hooked up to T-Mobile Wi-Fi calling, but if you dig deep into the operating system, the Wi-Fi calling is not active, states no Wi-Fi calling package. But, it seems to work as I got a Wi-Fi call today. So it works on inbound. It indicates the it is connected outbound as well in the UI menu.<br/><br/>Hangouts calling with Google voice goes through Wi-Fi as well.<br/><br/>I am just concerned the phone will have challenges with the free international data on T-Mobile since their system doesn't recognize the IMEI.
I just picked this thing up recently for a really cheap price and it's honestly incredible. Don't let the fact that it's a little over a year old deter you if you're considering picking this thing up. It's fast, lasts all day easily, has plug and play frequencies for most carriers, and is huge.<br/><br/>People tend to complain that it's too big, but as someone with larger than average hands, I find it really comfortable and honestly? I could never go back to anything sub 5.5 in. again. A steal at the price its being offered at!
This phone I wanted to love and keep, but it has too many cons in my opinion.  The battery life is not that good.  I was getting 3 hours of screen time.  The headset speaker is not the best when making phone calls.  Don't get it confused with the stereo front facing speakers which are great.  I saw lots of Nexus 6s with screen burn in, but that's the AMOLED screen.<br/>I was ok with the size and liked it, but I have to admit that it was a pain in the pocket.  The camera is so so too.<br/>Overall I think I would give it 3 stars.
Great sized phone . The large KB allows my clumsy figures to type more accurately. The photo and video quality is great for a phone. I was on a Verizon pre-paid plan before I bought this phone. I plugged in a Nano-chip for Verizon and my install went smoothly after I called Verizon. I had to call Verizon because my old Motorola G was a 3G phone and this is 4LGTE. They can't activate from a 3G phone plan to 4G phone plan via their website. You need to talk to a human. They were really nice.( I do need to charge it at the end of each day.)
I like it :) stable, fast and nice but the back cover is a bit slippery
I don't even know where to start, I love everything about this phone. Makes my old Samsung galaxy S4 look and feel like a joke. Excellent battery life, and I mean excellent. Beautiful screen. Quality dual speakers. Impressive camera especially for a Nexus. Honestly, the Nexus 6P doesn't even seem like its any better than the regular Nexus 6. I use this phone with Ting, it uses the T-Mobile network and I couldn't be happier. With this phone I NO longer feel like my iPhone friends have way better phones ha! Take that iPhone!
Learning all about it. The price was right and I love the no bloatware
The Good:<br/>Supersized display<br/>Android Lollipop<br/>Better 13MP camera<br/>Qi + Turbo charging<br/><br/>The bad:<br/>Way too big for some<br/>No Active Display<br/>Pricier than Nexus 5<br/>Redundant Messenger app<br/><br/>The verdict:<br/>Nexus 6 proves that Google's Nexus program is not only far from dead, it's alive and kicking with a powerful 6-inch phablet that runs its latest Android software. I recommend this phone for someone that want great phone but want a pure stock android experience.
Fone is smooth, never hangs.<br/>Battery Life is not up to the mark.
Bought one of the used ones from Amazon Warehouse and activated it on Sprint.  Works great. For Sprint customers a few suggestions. Call the International Sprint Service (Best Service in the World) and order a Nano SIM the same day you order the phone. Make sure you get NANO SIM SIMGLW426C Item # 760494000114 - Ask them to overnight the card (The card should come the same day as the phone). They are free from Sprint. When you get your phone and SIM card, call sprint to activate it.  DONE. Great phone for
Amazing phone. It's massive, but you get used to the size very quickly. The 1440p AMOLED screen is almost unbelievably clear. The fact that it runs stock android 5.1.1 (at time of writing) is a huge plus. The battery life is fantastic. Even when on near max brightness and using the phone on-and-off all day, I can come home with 30%+ battery remaining. It runs every game I've tried at a smooth seemingly 60+ fps. Highly recommended phone, for $350 it is a steal, blowing away phones prices over 2x as high.
This phone is very bold and beautiful. Love every moment I use it...
I absolutely love this phone. The only thing I would've liked better in a phone of this size is a bigger battery to power that amazing screen for longer. Other than that, no complaints. Turbo charger is a god send. The front cam isn't great @ just 2MP but I am not a selfie crazy person. Stock android looks and runs great but I am yet to receive Marshmallow. Google, are you listening??<br/><br/>I found out today that this phone is on eBay for 50 bucks less. Dang!!! I wish I could buy another one.
LOVE this phone. I bought my last phone used in 2013, so when I finally bought the Nexus 6, I couldn't believe how much Android had advanced and how many cool features I'd been missing out on. At first I thought the phablet size was a problem, but now I cant' see myself going back to a smalller screen. I love the phone and it's a perfect conversation starter. I work near a college campus and and it's always fun to hear the college girls exclaim "Wow, I've never seen one that big before!"
Absolutely love the phone. Good specs + stock Android =great phone.
It is a great phone overall, but the camera is one of the weak points. The first few days were ok, but after that, the camera had problems focusing and adjusting to light. Even after resetting the phone to default, the same issues were happening indicating it was more of a hardware issue than a setting that was changed.<br/><br/>However, if you need an awesome phone that has a sweet looking screen, you can't go wrong with this now given how much the price has dropped since new, its a bargain.
For the price this phone is selling for THIS IS A MUST BUY FOR ANDROID FANS. I have used nexus phone since I saved up for my first smartphone the Nexus 4. I had the pleasure of owning the 5 and now I have the pleasure of owning the 6. Marshmallow has done nothing but improve my experience and I am loving the support google extends to there legacy devices. Yes its big but thats why its awesome. its the do everything pocket pc with wireless charging to boot! Looking at you new nexus devices wth!
Love it, but it's a little too big even though I have large hands.
Arrived on time. Its a grwat phone, and for 350$ it just amazing.<br/>I love the screen. Watching youtube videos on it is great.<br/>I feel very comfortable with phone size. I had note 3 previously with 5.7 screen, but I can say that 6" is not that bigger.<br/>The only problem with this phone is battery life. Dont get me wrong, it gets my through the day, but it definitely not that good how it was on note 3. And fast charge help a lot.<br/>Hope in android M it will be fixed.
I've had the phone for a couple of days now and I'm super impressed. The screen makes reading way more pleasurable than on my Nexus 5 (5 inch screen) and the battery life is phenomenal. The battery had over 30% remaining after a full day of active use on the weekend, with the screen at full brightness and a live wallpaper running in the background all the time.<br/><br/>Also, I love that the screen activate when you pick the phone up, which was a great, unexpected feature.
Disappointed with screen pattern.  It is not LCD.  Looks poorly.
Great phone. Arrived on time, as expected. Easy to setup.<br/>Large screen; construction looks and feels solid. Buttons are large enough and are logically placed.<br/>Calls quality is very good. Sound is loud and clear.<br/>Cameras work well.<br/>Performance is flawless (email, internet speed, apps speed)<br/>No complaints at all, so far.<br/>I just want to stress that the Nexus 6 is a large phone, so if you have small hands you should explore other options as well.
Awesome Phone if you are looking for a Phablet and don't want to waste a lot of money.<br/>I was lucky to got a nice deal at Amazon .. So make sure don't forget to see Today's Deals  ::) saved my 100 bucks<br/><br/>Running Android 6 , Google always rocks .. This time Motorola has given some decent hardware to back up the Google SWs.<br/>It would have been really nice if there could have a Fingerprint Sensor instead of M symbol at back --- Overall A great phone ..
Very happy that I chose the Nexus 6 so far. The enormous, beautiful screen is truly impressive for viewing text, images, and video. It is fast, responsive, and capable of performing whatever task I throw at it. Pure Android is much better than the modified versions from other manufacturers and soon Android 6.0 Marshmallow will be available for it. Battery life is good - I have several draining apps running constantly and still gets me through the bulk of the day.
WAO! This is the best phone I've gotten so far. I've an iPhone user for some time now, but needed an android phone for the google services at my work and well I gave it a try and it's been quite smooth. Only have used it for 1 day but it's extremely easy to use.  Only issue is that it get a little hot when using it over more than 10 minutes straight but is not discomforting. Give 5 stars as the design fits all my needs and I got android M upgrade right away.
I just received this today, came overnight to Alaska. sending it back. I wanted to love it, but within the first hour 1/2 the screen froze up on me. It did this several times. speaker crackled too. I researched all the phones and their problems, as all phones have problems or glitches, none are perfect. I am currently on a Galaxy s5. I like to change phones about every 6-8 months. The search goes on. Amazon is always great about returns. Thank Goodness.
Yes no glass screen protector can cover the entire screen since its curved.<br/><br/>Yet this goes on easy with no dust or bubbles.<br/>This has saved my phone once so far.  I am waiting for the crack to get worse before replacing.<br/><br/>Some people don't understand these are sacrificial screen protectors and that the glass must be weaker than the screen. If it was stronger it would just transfer the shock through the glass in to the screen.
I picked the phone up last Sunday and have been using it a week. It's definitely not as big as it was alluded to. I'm coming from a Nexus 4 which was in a ballistic case which was kinda bulky.<br/><br/>I put it in the Supcase hybrid case as it was cheap and provides good protection without adding a lot of bulkiness.<br/><br/>It's running on my pre-paid Cricket wireless account and it works fine.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm pleased with the phone.
A little disappointed in battery life, but I was experiencing decreased life on my last phone.  It has to be one of my apps. The size is not as bad as one would suspect.  It fits nicely in my hand.  I do have to use two hands, but that also eliminates the temptation to Reply/text while driving. A little annoyed by the flipping of the power outlet to the opposite direction of every other port that I've had on my phones since 2012 (Logo to the back)
No bloatware no bologna. The best phablet on the market.<br/><br/>This device is very power hungry and can drain its battery while plugged into normal USB. You need the speed charger for it.<br/><br/>I very happy with this purchase. I bought mine open box and it has the the most miniscule chip in the glass that surrounds the camera. Other than that it was brand new.
Can't believe I was able to get this phone for $199 on Black Friday! My daughter wanted a new phone and her tastes for phones is getting a little expensive these days and I've already owned the Nexus 5 for two years so I already knew about the Nexus 6 and how good it was, so when I saw this phone go on sale Friday morning I jumped all over it!<br/><br/>Item arrived in 2 days and I've already opened and tested it and it works with no issues!!
Flag ship phone on stock Android. Big, sharp, screen makes it easy to see things.  Keyboard much easier to use than my old Galaxy S3.  This is the model XT1103 which is a US model that runs on all four major carriers.  It's unlocked so U can also use it on many low cost prepaid services also. Phone is Google Project Fi compatible.  Gr8 price $349.99 w/free shipping really makes this one of the best values on the market today.  Thanks Amazon !
***yes this phone works on verizon right out of the box I bought a sim card cutter and cut my micro sim card down to a nano put it in and it got lte very fast once I turned it on I unlocked its bootloader and rooted it the first day I got it so I could tether like a mad man if you have any questions about unlocking boot loader or rooting send me a email  juddlr@yahoo.com i will help you the phone is really that good I ordered my honey one :)
This is truly an amazing phone. The expansive screen is ideal for gaming, media consumption and reading.<br/><br/>While the size was initially off-putting, I got used to the phone within a week or so. Now even the Nexus 5 I used to use seems small and cramped.<br/><br/>Build quality is excellent and it feels good in the hand. Call quality is also well above average and the camera is adequate. All in all, an excellent all around device.
THE BOMB! I love this phone... The best phone I ever had!!
The phone heatup a lot and the battery life is really bad.
Activated on Sprint online without an issue.  Great phone.
Phone came new and sealed in box with fast shipping. Nexus 6 itself is pretty great. It's huge, but the display is absolutely gorgeous and there is a huge difference between it and my iPhone 5s. It does get a little warm at times though, especially while using the included Turbo charger (which is awesome, it charges the whole phone in around 80 minutes). UI is snappy, but there are the occasional hiccups. Overall a good phone.
Great phone.  Larger than most, but that's what I wanted.
Bought open box item. Perfect so far, no complaints here.
I've been using this phone for about 4 weeks and I have to write to say that I love this phone completely.  It is BIG and I love the front facing stereo speakers.  I have cell service from GoSmart, which has limited range compared to AT&T;, but is much cheaper.  I'm coming from a Galaxy S4 and a OnePlus One.  This Nexus 6 beats the S4 hands down, of course, and it is better than the OnePlus One.  I would buy this phone again.
I am so impressed with this device. At first holding it the size is is large. But after using it it just fits. The screen real estate is luxurious. It has great camera  and battery life that lasts all day. After receiving the phone it updated to 6.0. I love having Qi charging. I am using project Fi as it one of 3 phones that can. I don't think you can go wrong with purchasing this phone. It is a bargain currently on Amazon.
Why did I wait so long. This phone is awesome, huge, but awesome. Big step up from my galaxy S5. Camera was a step sideways or maybe down. But nexus gets you into Project Fi so this is a cheap way to get started.<br/><br/>The screen is awesome, camera is ok, speed is phenomenal, and stock Android is where it's at. I've had iPhones, flip phones, Samsung smart phones and this. This is my favorite. I may skip the Nexus 6p.
its our first original android os equipped smartphone, not like fake Chinese mainland product. we enjoy its in time update, simplicity of google services very much. fortunately Chinamobile namo sim card works well in it. wireless charging allows flexible charging schedule. we definitely love it, even broking sinking PRC's surveillance to update google's service and access google play can be sweaty.thx God we still do it.
This is a thing of beauty. But you should get a good bumper case for it because it's rather slippery. I installed the T-Mobile Nano SIM in the top slot, went online and activated the phone, and I was off to the races. It updated to Android 5.01, then to 5.1, then to 5.1.1 which took some time. The phone's processor is fast, the 6" screen is crystal clear, and it operates flawlessly on my home's Wi-Fi. I'm very happy.
All was delivered as expected and on time. No complaints
I love Android phones and Nexus gives the pure Android experience. Love this phone and got 64 GB model for a reasonable price. Phone responds super quick, boots up past, with a very smooth user experience. Recently got updated to Android M (6.0 Marshmallow) and have much control over app permissions. Only downside for me is the front camera which is 2 MP where as some Androids from 2014 are having better front camera.
I wanted this phone when it first come out but the price was pretty high. I got a Moto X 2nd Gen.Had it for just 6 months then I dropped it. Cracked Glass. Checked Amazon for a replacement then saw the Nexus 6 had knocked off 300.00. Bought it,got it in 5 days, waited at Verizon for 45 minutes for a tech. They took the sim out of my Moto X and popped it in. Everything working in 10 minutes. I'm one happy customer.
This is my 2nd Nexus 6 64gb from amazon. Both of them have screen issues. The 1st one has a screen banding/vertical lines with bluish and yellowish tint from top and bottom. So I send that back and got my 2nd one again from amazon. This 2nd one has no vertical lines, but has some uneven screen tone visible on dark and light background on the screen. I might return this back or keep it. I'm not sure, but we'll see.
Great update from Nexus 5, and the screen is so amazing! I think the big screen is absolutely fantastic!!! Also another great thing is that is running the latest stock Android version, and not something ugly (TOUCHWIZ). Also big improvement in the camera I think. If there is anything I'm not to crazy about it would be the design of the phone, button placement, the rounded back. Still a much better phone than most!
Perfect size for my hands and aging eyes.<br/><br/>Only minor annoyance so far is the power button is right in the middle of the phone, so when I pick it up on the go, I occasionally hold the power button too long, rebooting the phone.<br/><br/>Would have liked to pick up the Moto-Care protection plan, however Motorola only offers it if you purchase the phone through their website. Bummer. Get with it, Moto.
Really awesome phone. I read the software is the sole of a system, forget about the peripherals; and it is so true!  The combo of being on Android and having a Motorola/Google combo for my phone is perfect.  The real beauty is you don't have to deal with any bloat or crapware from any provider.  Need a nano sim, so I got Fosmon nano SIM card cutter and it worked beautifully. Truly no technical knowledge needed.
Was a little worried when I ordered this phone since the reviews weren't as good as I expected.  But I have no idea what some of these lukewarm reviews are talking about.  I absolutely love this phone.  It's beautiful and functional, and just feels amazingly fast.  This is a much better one-handed phone with the "back" button on the left and the curved back.  Really happy I could get this one for $400.
Nice phone
I believe most of us who buy Nexus 6 are android lovers. I used several android phones and others as well. I absolutely love this phone. Here is why!<br/>1. Pure android (no unnecessary bloatware installed by the manufacturer or carrier)<br/>2. Perfect size to read, play, productivity, and phone (I rarely talk on the phone. If you use your phone for voice communication more often, it might too big for you)
I truly love my purchase. There was a bit of frustration between whether I received to international or US version. I wish there were programming and a manual with instructions (booklet) that would have been included. The only down side that is a little bothersome, is that there is not an option to expand memory, by use of a sd card. Overall, this is one that I strongly recommend and would purchase again.
Cracked my nexus 6 recently and Motorola repair service is ridiculous they want $500 deposit for a $349 phone on top of paying $200 to get a "like new" replacement I just decided to get a new phone love nexus phones especially now with project fi. Yes I'm aware I get my $500 back after I return my damage IF the problem with the phone is what I said. I'm broke I can't put nearly $800 on the line.
This Motorola NEXUS-6 pure stock firmware device is the only way to experience Google ANDROID as it was meant to be.  It is built with the highest quality flagship materials and does not contain bloat-ware installed by manufacturers or cell phone carriers.  I also like the fact that NEXUS devices are the first to get the latest firmware updates on a regular basis.  A lot of phone worth every penny!
This is a great phone! The size is great. It's plenty powerful. The screen is awesome. I took 1 star off for 2 reasons: the phone is not flat so it wobbles if you use it as a calculator on your desk. I'm also getting tired of phones that are hard to hold on to. It has nothing to do with size. The shape makes it absolutely necessary to buy a case. You will drop this phone eventually if you don't.
No regrets after two months with this phone, especially at the previous sale price.  Good voice clarity and a great screen.  I typically get at least a day of battery use but the included turbo power charger is amazingly fast when I do need it.  The phone has worked great on T-Mobile but I've just switched to Google Fi, which was my primary reason for replacing my previous phone with the Nexus.
This phone is amazing. It's huge, but you get used to it quite fast and then every other phone feels like a toy.<br/>Android runs perfectly smooth. It's the best phone I've ever had.<br/>The back camera is great, but the front camera needs a lot of light to work properly.<br/>I'm from Argentina and it works with local phone networks and carriers (at least it works for Personal and Movistar).
Have used it for 2 months now, best Android phone I have ever used.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1) Good battery backup<br/>2) display<br/>3) speed<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1) Does not connect to Wifi Hotspot.<br/>Same Android version works correctly in my old Nexus 5 phone.<br/>Works correctly with usual wifi, but not wifi hotspot. Cannot figure out why.<br/>2) Little bulkier to use with 1 hand.
Went from Huawei Ascend Mate 2 to this recently.  While I do enjoy the pure Android experience I would trade the high pixel count for battery life any day.  I have to get used to charging every night after being spoiled by the Huawei which lasted two full days.  If Huawei could migrate to Marshmallow or at least Lollipop I would go back to it but for now last years flagship will do
I have been using my unlocked Nexus 6 on Verizon for over a month now. This is by far my favorite smartphone I have ever owned, & I have owned a lot. Since this phone has gone on sale I think it is the best value for high and smartphone. You will not be disappointed with this phone if you love to tinker with Android. This week this phone should be receiving Android 6.0 marshmallow.
Fast. Beautiful screen, beautiful camera. Size took a little bit of time to get used to but now everything smaller feels inferior. If you wear tight pants with small pockets it straight up doesn't fit, but there are plenty of alternative options to putting your phone in your pocket.<br/><br/>I would absolutely make this purchase again if given the choice, great use of my money.
Great phone, however, AT&T; locked the phone to them as soon as I put their simcard into it. It's not Amazon or the company I bought it off of. I am just saying that you might have to call your phone company to unlock it after installing a simcard. Great phone, would recommend it because it is pure Android. Doesn't have carrier or manufacturer bloatware, which is a huge plus.
Yes the phone is big.But honestly for the price and the fact that is stock android is worth every single penny. Very fast processor,nice clear colors,great stereo speakers and with the Motorola charger it does not take hours to get a full charge. If you are an Android fan,this is your daddy. No bloat wear from phone carriers just pure Google Android Lollipop. It works great.
Don't buy it period ! Their price is insane, doesn't make sense at all.  The design is not great especially with Motorola logo.  For nine hundred something just because it is running lollipop 5.0 ?  LOL.<br/>Check out this flagship killer oneplus one.  You don't need to look for others.  Trust me on this!
I love it! New item in original box, all perfect.
Decent phone, fast and good screen.<br/>The cons are:<br/>* Too huge. Even compared with other devices with similar screen size.<br/>* Buttons in the middle make it really awkward to use it as a gps nav in a car - since most cradles hold the phone by the sides, so they tend to cover those buttons or even worse - constantly press them on every bump.<br/>* Too huge!
Have had the phone for less than 5 days and has already frozen up 3 times. Had very few apps loaded. Also, it is pretty large for a smaller hand. the camera took nice pictures and the dual speakers are great!!! I have owned a Nexus 5 for 2 years and have liked it very much. I don't really have many complaints other than it shouldn't be freezing up as it is brand new.
I have only had the phone for a full day but love it so far. One of my previous phones was a Nexus 5 ahich I fell in love with. Snagged it on sale during black Friday. It is a very big phone but my previous phone was a Note 3 so the size was not a problem. I have not played with it as much as I would like and will update this review later after more use.
Bought the Nexus 6 to use with Verizon.  No problem at all with Verizon.  I called them and had them ship the nano sim card. Once I had that and the phone, everything transferred over.  This was over the phone with tech support and not in one of the Verizon stores. Phone has been great.  It is big but thats kinda what you're going to get with a phablet.
First of all, the size is not an issue at all. I'm on my second one (first had overheating and screen problems), and after returning it for a replacement, the second one works perfectly. You can nitpick details about camera apertures and display technologies all you want, but after you've got it, you don't think about any of those things. great phone.
The battery life is great I'm usually watching videos or streaming on Netflix for a few hours at a time and it's front facing speakers are amazing really loud and it's screen looks beautiful only downsides are it's hard to handle with just one hand cause of its size and if you turn the brightness real low it's got like a pink tint to everything
Best cell phone I have had to date. If you are an existing Verizon customer, you can simply install your sim card and go. (In my case, I had to use a sim card cutter to reduce sim card from a micro sim to a nano sim.).<br/><br/>Phone has excellent reception. No call drops. Nexus 6 shipped with Lollipop but has already updated to Marshmallow.
I bought the 64 GB  version based mainly on the positive reviews and also the specs. I paid $400 on amazon and so far I am enjoying this phone.<br/>The negative thing  is the mobile data stops working  whenever you make or receive a voice call. I am not sure whether this is a bug or if the phone is unable to do both voice call and mobile data
Excellent phone! Works perfectly in Argentina
Yes, it's pretty big.  Yes, it requires two hands to run it most of the time.  But the screen is brilliant, it's fast, it almost always carries the latest updates and OS, the battery lasts a long time, it's pretty intuitive to use, the sound quality is acceptable, as are the cameras.  I'm using mine with Google Project Fi and I'm loving it.
I love this phone. Great build quality, incredible screen. Apps respond really fast and the battery lasts me a day and a half. Not to mention is far less expensive than an unlocked iPhone with similar stats. I use it on Straight Talk with excellent reception and data speeds. It came with 5.1.1 and am looking forward to seeing 6.0 on it.
best phone ive ever owned. love love love it
The device is huge and not for everyone, but I have gotten used to it and at the discounted price it was a great deal.  If you want a big phone, pure Android automatically updated by Google, with dual front facing speakers, don't hesitate.  At the discounted price this phone has some advantages even over the Nexus 6P in my opinion.
Love this phone, it is everything I wanted. It is big with a six inch screen, but that is exactly how I wanted it. Now I do not have to worry about hitting different letters when texting because of my fat fingers. The pure version of Android is also a plus because do not have to worry about having unnecessary OEM apps on my phone.
I've had my eye on this phone since the specs were first published and finally pulled the trigger and bought it on Amazon.  Wow. Everything about this phone is very nicely done. The look/feel/functionality is exceptional and the screen real estate is perfect.  I'm so glad I decided to step up from the run-of-the-mill size phones.
Very good phone, took a bit to get it to update to Marshmallow but after i got it, phones been good. Battery life is ok, coming from a Droid Maxx it definitely goes through battery much quicker, but understandable. My only real complain is how low down the lock button is on the phone, and how close the volume buttons are to it.
a gift for my husband,he is love it so much
Great product. Front camera is pretty weak.
Really great phone. Stock Android is buttery smooth and I have had no issues with this phone. A bit on the large side but once you get used to it, it becomes second nature. The onltly thing I can think in terms of improvements would have been an IR sensor like the G4 has but that's not a make or break feature for me anyway.
The back cover has big enough gaps almost all around the phone out of the box ,  not sure if that affects the durability of the phone but this is disappointing to see on a flagship device. It's gonna trap a lot of dust.<br/>Everything else is great battery, screen, software, performance except front speaker are just Ok.
I love this phone, its awesome.<br/><br/>was able to root it no problem.<br/><br/>found a great ROM that is quick and running marshmallow.<br/><br/>if your looking for a daily driver, this would be it.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a phone that is mainly used for a camera, you may want to look somewhere else.
Best smart phone for this price (350)I was looking also for a Moto X (more expensive)  and the ASUS (less expensive)  finally I decide for Nexus, because I come from Nexus 5 and the upgrades and "simbiosis"  between  OS and Device are incredible.<br/>Battery life is so good and display is sharp and clean.
Fantastic phone.  The only issue I have with the phone is that the vibration is fairly loud compared to other phones that I have owned.  On the plus side, the phone is very fast (just below the new 6P in specs) and is meant to run custom ROMs without issue.  I can safely say that it is the best phone I have owned.
Phone arrived early, as described, brand-new, and in perfect working order. I ordered the 32GB white colored model and I'm using it unlocked on a GSM carrier in the US. Works brilliantly. The device itself is fast, and connects to networks with no problems. I'm happy with the purchase and got a really great deal.
LOVE! This phone. Huge Google fan. Sold my nexus 5 and got this one for the same price I paid for a 32 gig 5. Love the price. Can't beat it. I got the 64 gig. Lightning fast and it was the US version not the international. If you have the 4 or 5. Or a lesser type android, do your self a favor and buy this phone.
The heat problem is strong with this one!
Got my new phone 3 weeks with the intention of testing it out and returning it if it didn't pan out. Well after some hiccups when I first got it that were rectified by installing the latest version of lollipop ( removed my Cricket wireless sim card and did a factory reinstall to update) This phone is great!!!!
I just got my phone on Monday. It is super fast and very large which is what I like. It does everything that I want and then some. Lots of room and lots of fun. Easy to use I just love this phone. The graphics and sound quality are just amazing. Gaming is much faster and much better for you get more out of it.
Take care when ordering this on Amazon, I have seen several postings of Nexus 6s and noticed the "model number" labeled "model reference" and other attempts to obscure what you're actually buying. I ordered  a  Nexus 6 XT1103, the North Americas model. I received a Nexus 6, mo. XT1100 International, which is useless in the states. I am not happy and will be returning the phone. *Edit* After returning the phone and receiving the correct model I can say this is the phone for me and well worth the wait. My earlier complaint was misplaced frustration at a shipping error, and had little relevance to the phone, which is fantastic. Huge, fast and beautiful. Highly recommended.
I need saler contact with me , the reason I give them only 1 star because when I got the device try to set this phone , the screen rotation didn't work , phone speaker not work either, I know how to use an android phone . I just need some contact me and help me make a replacement for my device , thanks !
Good Phone if you are ok with its monstrous size.  Screen is a bit washed out (Google has not done a great job in calibrating the screen).  Sub par battery life (3-4 Hours SOT).<br/><br/>Ended up in returning mine since it has issues with the Speakerphone (Choppy Voice while using the speaker phone)
just one thing making me recall of Nexus 5,which covered by unslippery cover with good handfeel,but for this nexus 6,the back cover and whole shape is a bit bizzare,which keeps rotating while putting it on the table and keep slippery while holding in hand,not an ideal design from safety perspective.
I like everything about this phone regardless size or battery life. But there are two down sides about this phone. One - it is surely not a budget phone, why they don't provide a headphone? Two - Screen color is amazing but when it dims to the lower, it seems to turn into red-ish. Overall I love it.
Great phone, 5 star service from Amazon
Best phone I've ever had. Ex: dropped phone and lost it. Turns out someone ran it over with a bike and turned it in to the lost and found. I got it back with absolutely no damages except to the screen protector it came with. Wasn't even in a case. Name an iPhone that survived that with no damages
I have owned every flagship and "phablet" you can think of.  This has been my absolute favorite.  It has a wonderful blend of specs, size, manageability, speed and battery life.  If you are thinking about getting a big phone this should be it.  The front facing speakers are a great bonus.
Like this phone although I thought I would love stock android and nexus. Still at $199 for a black Friday deal, I can't complain (too much). Here are a few glaring issues I have with this phone after a weeks use.<br/><br/>* The phone has a yellow toned screen, not off white not cream colored but yellowish. This is apparently noticeable when held next to my previous phone, the LG G2. I'm not a big fan of the warmer tone as it makes the screen seems dirty and also lowers the vivid colors and resolution in my opinion. This is an apparent issue across the board with the Nexus 6. I should have researched a bit more prior to purchasing it.<br/>* When running multiple apps, there is no option to "clear all" at once. You have to manually swipe each window you want to close. Time consuming to say the least and quite inconvenient.<br/>* Has a pretty strong Vibration which CANNOT be adjusted or softened. This is very annoying and almost a deal breaker for me. I don't want my phone to be buzzing loud with every notification. This sucks hard!<br/>* Google camera is almost too plain and simple. But the worst part is the annoying shutter sound which CANNOT be muted or changed. It doesn't even have your standard shutter sound, instead you get an annoying "Blip" sound. Super wack!<br/>* Google photos is too minimal with very few options. There are no enhance settings or the ability to crop photos. You have to download a third party app to get all those nice features. Lame!<br/>* The charging port is upside down for whatever reason. Motorola decided they wanted to be cool and different on this one and it takes getting used to. It just doesn't feel right, it's like learning to write from right to left, no thanks. Hell no!<br/>* While stock android is minimal and nice, it seems almost too plain with few options. Don't get me wrong I like it and the few things it has it does extremely well but sometimes I miss having those extra options the company skins provides, especially in regards to widgets.<br/>* Camera is just OK. My LG G2 takes better pictures.<br/><br/>Overall I like the device but those are a few glaring issues that would make anyone think twice about it. Yes I love the big screen, stock android with the fastest updates but in all honesty I wouldn't of paid regular price for it. Good thing I got in on sale otherwise I would have returned it.
It arrived as scheduled in great condition box was great as well not tore up the phone runs amazing very satisfied with my purchase I came from an iPhone 6 it is definitely a lot bigger but I was easily able to adapt to the  size within a day of using it great battery life very user friendly
very big phone. worth the price though
Nice phone at a very reasonable price.
Fast, but quirky, camera sometimes failing to respond tweeting reboot. Tooooo damn big, and honestly, why do they make the glass curve at the edges without any metal protection? If it drops the impact points are more likely to be on glass, therefore requiring to buy a bigger, bulkier case.
So far so good.  I was never a fan of an iPhone. I had one issued from work and my bear paws of hands it was hard to text and email.  I switched to am OPO and loved it.  However I dropped that and the screen cracked.  So I got the Nexus 6 to try out Project Fi.  So far Im loving the phone.
The phone is very good, the screen is good,the camera is good, but the battery is problem, i need charge 2 times one day.<br/>I come from Nokia 800c, the nexus 6 is so big and it is hard to make phone call using one hand.
This phone is one of the best phones I ever use. I have only one issue about this phone, which is the calculator, the calculator have no percentage sign. I always use the calculator in my daily activities. I hope Motorola and Google will resolve this percentage issue. I love the phone.
Wow, need I say more.  The best price for this purchase is on Amazon.  I LOVE THIS PHONE!  Check out all the feedback on tech magazines.<br/>Soon to receive 6.0.  I prefer this over the soon to be coming,  6p  as the width size is greater.  It arrived SEALED and NEW as promised.  WOW!
I got this phone and I'm enjoying it thus far delivered in good condition the only reason it didn't get 5 stars was due to 1 accessory not being included(headset). However all other necessary accessories  USB,charger, pin to open sim slot were included so I'm happy with this purchase
Great deal at the new price. This phone holds its own against the new nexuses and is cheaper. Its a bit slippery, but I am used to the size and can't stand looking at normal phones again. Battery lasts all day, camera is good, its fast, and everything works as it should. I recommend.
awesome phone.  Very fast.  Upgraded Rom to Pure Nexus.  Meet my expectations and more.  Glad I didn't get the Note 4 or Iphone 6 Plus.  It would have increased my monthly phone charges from $50 to 79 for new contract, plus the 3-400 for the phone (400 for Note 4, or 300 for Iphone)
This is a very good phone and I've had all the good ones Samsung, LG, HTC, and this phone is as good as any of them even better if you like the look of stock android screen is awesome and I like that it immediately gets any Google android updates and for $350 well worth the money
If you're going to buy an android phone, buy a Nexus.  They are virgin android experience.  They also get the quickest updates!  I had a first gen Moto X and loved it, except for the screen size.  I'm absolutely in love with my Nexus 6!  I would recommend this phone to anyone.
While it's a great phone full of top-notch features, I made the switch from overpriced Verizon Wireless to T-Mobile to save money, take advantage of gobs of data at crazy low cost, and take my chances that the network will continue to improve based on their dramatically increasing market share.<br/><br/>But hold the phone, kids, things are not all as they seem.  No amount of YouTube troubleshooting videos, Android Central user forum posts, not even my sons who campaigned long and hard in an effort to get me and dear ol' dad to bail on Verizon, could have prepared me for the disappointment (nay, ignorance?) when I tried time and again to enable WiFi calling, to no avail. Granted, the ad here on Amazon.com doesn't appear to mislead, but the marketing geniuses at T-Mobile are going to hear from me about the lack of any mention of a difference between the device they and others sell bearing the Motorola dimple and signature Nexus logo on the flipside. Does the cost-conscious yet marginally savvy user going to understand the importance of a build number, which translates to WiFi calling or not? Unlikely. Or am I the only one? Maybe so, considering the lack of mention on the T-Mobile support pages. Or is someone keeping it quiet for a reason? I wonder.
Amazing phone, almost perfect.......
This is my first Android phone and I couldn't be happier. This is a high end phone with great specs and is priced right. I bought mine at amazon but this phone is currently available for less than $300 on New Egg. Highly recommend this phone if you are considering a Phablet.
Very much did! I've had it for over a month. I refuse to buy apple on principle. This phone is the android response and imo much better. Apps are mostly free. This comes with barebone minimal apps unlike my previous Samsung in which were stuck on my phone. I love this phone.
Best phone I have ever owned! I bought the used version through Ecellular and it came looking as if it was brand new. I love the big display because it is very easy for me to type as I have big fingers and hands. Everything works perfectly fine. I am using project Fi, but I've heard it works with all carriers, just make sure you have a nano sim card.
This is a really good phone big sharp screen, front dual speakers, stock android.this phone is packing but the phone stutters at times and the camera isn't terrible but not the best either and the battery could be better but nonetheless its an awesome phone at a good price
____<br/><br/>When Amazon listed the 64GB/3GB version brand new for $329 I jumped on it to add in my collection<br/><br/>I recommend this phone in the $350-400 range after that you might as well go with the latest Google Nexus Huawei 6P version for $500-$650<br/>_____
For a last-generation phone, it still feels like a new phone.  Everything is smooth and quick, battery life lasts more than a day with moderate use and several hours or more of heavy wifi tethering.  It is a large phone though, I struggle to operate it with a single hand.
I love my new phone. It was quite a bit larger than what I had but it did not take long for me to get used to it.  Now whenever I see a smaller phone I don't know how I managed with such a small screen. I don't think I could go back to a smaller phone and I don't want to!
Everything about the phone was great as described. However, the biggest downfall was the battery life. It doesn't even last 8 hours. Drains tremendously even on standby. The description says 24hours and more.
Delivery & packaging superb.  The device exceeded my expectations in battery life, performance & features.  This is my first 'big screen' phone so I'm still getting used to holding it, how it fits  into my jeans pockets & so on.  No regrets on this purchase, however.
Great screen and touch system, always updated to the last version of Android.Great processor also. The downside, no option to add external memory or to change battery. The display is huge if you are used to smaller phones, but when you get use to it, its fantastinc.
After charging the Nexus 6 with 5.0, powered the unit without the sim card.<br/>Setup gmail account and home wifi then upgraded to the current 6.0.<br/>After all updates were done, powered off to insert the sim card.<br/><br/>The Nexus 6 is working great.
Great phone, bought it, to replace a Moto X 2nd gen with a cracked screen, of the same design.<br/><br/>Worked wonders on the ATT network, and now that I'm using Google Fi, which uses both Tmobile and Sprint networks, I can say they to work without issue.
Someone had to say it, this is the american version. XT1103. I have it on metropcs right now, lte is displayed up top. APN settings in phone are compatible with metropcs. Built for people who got big hands like me, ppi is incredible, quality is perfect, speakers facing forward !!!!!FINALLY!!!!! everything about it great. go here:<br/>http://www.wugfresh.com/nrt/videos/<br/>and download the root tool, you'll need to back up files, uninstall all current drivers on computer, install their drivers, unlock bootloader and then root it, and you'll access all the phone WITHOUT BRICKING IT. starting up and shutting down the phone is much much faster. if you do brick your phone, the software itself will allow you to flash rom with stock rom and go back to the way it was right out the box. The LED light notifications are behind the top speaker, red blue and green lights, you must root phone and download "light flow". you don't need to buy it, google it and download the apk file. you can get rid of the annoying search bar on home screen. you can disable all annoying bloatware and google apps you don't need and never use. This phone becomes your phone once you do all this. I made the mistake of loosening my grip with the galaxy mega 6.3 and dropped it while i was sitting down, I cracked the screen in the corner, so I am being extra careful this time with a better case and always holding my nexus 6 phone tight. Highly recommend this phone to anyone with big hands and big demands for quality.
Fast delivery. Item as described.
Great phone.  Came from note 3 and this one is even bigger.  Pretty much has to be a 2 handed phone.  I'm ok with that though. If it had a microsd slot it would have been 5 stars for me.  With 6.0 update battery is great. Works great with Project FI.
Absolutely the best Android phone available! After years of having under-performing(HTC), under-supported (HTC and Sony), and just generally cheap (Samsung) phones, I finally have the phone that gets all the updates ahead if everyone. I absolutely adore the fact that I have an unlocked and untouched phone that doesn't have all the sprint, T-Mobile and att&t; junk that comes with their contract phones. This phone is fast and sexy. I work in a shop where myself and one other guy are the only two of 9 people that have Android phones. Those other 7 are diehard Apple fans and they have definitely taken notice of my phones sleekness and features. I have to say Motorola is back! I had the moto x 2nd gen before this and loved everything but the size. It was simply to small for me to text on. Before that I had the Sony Xperia Z1s which was an amazing phone and was so awesome that I didn't want to part with it but not being on 5.0 was killing me and T-Mobile and Sony took entirely to long to update (not sure if they ever did). If youbare on the fence with this phone, in my honest opinion, then you should only be looking at the moto x (because you need a smaller phone) or the newish Sony Xperia Z3 and now Z4 due to the micro SD card option. The only other phone that may be better than this is the LG G3/4. I almost bought the G3 because of the screen, but now that my wife has it, the camera us only subpar to the Nexus 6. What an amazing phone!
Note 3 damaged and still grandfathered with unlimited data with Verizon so was on the hunt for a new phone.Was looking for a note 4 ran across the nexus 6 and could not be happier. Performance is awesome and screen is the of the best. Very pleased
Owned a Samsung Glaxay S4 on prepaid for a while until I smashed the screen, didn't like it enough to buy another one. I bought the Nexus 6 and I love it!!! Way better then the Glaxay!! Quite frankly it's the best phone I've owned to this day!!!
OH What a nice wonderful phone!!! It is was easy to add to my existing phone service too!  The camera is extreme!  Love it! Price really great too!<br/>I wanted to get an iphone and I am glad I didn't get one and bought the Nexus 6 instead!
Really it's one of the best android phone that i have used i like it so much, and I'm very happy to buy it.<br/>it's not very big as they said, at least for me i fill it's very comfortable but sure you can't use it by one hand conveniently.
Really like the phone.<br/><br/>One thing to mention, if you run it in China with China Net 4G carrier, there could be some issues on mobile data connection. At least in my circumstance, I still need to find a way to make it run smoothly.
Great phone at a great price!<br/><br/>Don't be scared away by the size, but this phone is a BEAST in every positive sense of the word!<br/><br/>Great specs and great performance at an even better price!<br/><br/>Highly recommended!!!
Good phone smooth and fast.  Battery life is okay hopefully better once Marshmallow arrives.  A little wide for the hand but screen real estate is sweet.  Front facing speakers nice for multimedia.  Not perfect but stock Android is nice.
The reason why I bought this Nexus 6 is unlocked for prepaid plan in US.<br/>H20's 3 in 1 sim card is very good except LTE setting.<br/>Call to H20 service and ask them how to set LTE. Not that difficult but you cannot get by yourself.
This phone is amazing. I love the lack of carrier bloat wear. It works like a champ with Verizon.<br/>The only down side to this phone is the lack of an LED to notify of different alerts (texts, emails, Facebook notifications, etc.).
Activated on MetroPCS in 5 minutes over the phone. Received 5.1.1 OTA, and 3 security patches within 3 days. All over Wi-Fi and no problems. Registered for warranty with Motorola and its for 14 months. Very happy with this purchase.
Battery life has sucked, hard, and the screen's color production is not good. I love AMOLed, but this panel is just not high quality. I love the size, and stock Android, but unfortunately I can't recommend this phone to most people.
So far so great. It is taking time to get used to lollipop 5.1. Easy setup and nice looking. I was worried because many comments were made that you need two hands to use the phone. Nope, that is not true. Love it and love the price.
My nexus 6 has a sound distortion problem when I'm talking to someone.  The static sounding noise prevents me from hearing clearly.  Hopefully the OS update fixe the problem.
Excellent Black Friday deal, fast shipping, excellent service, and awesome device. I switched from an iPhone 5 and the camera megapixel difference is astounding! Still learning this phone and android set up, but absolutely love it!
Well, my first nexus phone, enjoy the "Pure" Andriod, Google Software, Andriod Update, also the big warm screen. No complain on the plastic Motorola. All in all, very good for me, hope it could serve me more than two years.
The phone is great it really met my expectations from all direction. Here are some points of the phone after one month of usage: (I'll start with the bad stuff then go to the good things about the phone)<br/><br/>Ugly stuff:<br/>- if you choose to lock your phone with a pass code an someone called you the screen does not activate. You have to do it manually in able to be able to answer the call.<br/>- the phone is all screen. Sometimes it feels like its gonna fall an crack<br/><br/>Bad stuff:<br/>- the phone is too huge to handle. If you don't like big phones this one is too big<br/>- in some online reviews and unboxing of the phone, it says that it comes with another charger that you can put the phone on it an it'll charge, but I am not really sure about that, mine didn't have that.<br/>- data usage is too high, you should really pay attention to the data usage.<br/>- high price. Although I really think its worth it comparing to other devices.<br/>- you can't place the phone on a flat surface. It'll keep rotating due to the curve.<br/>Good stuff:<br/>- Battery life ( guaranteed full day) sometimes more repentant on usage.<br/>- screen is great for videos and other media.<br/>- high quality pics although I don't take pictures a lot.<br/>- the sound is a beast.<br/>- no lag at all, due to its processor.
I have always been an IPhone person, but this phone is great. The screen is super bright,  fast and easy to use.  The battery last me all day.<br/>So far I have been able to use all the apps I needed and found some great new one.
No idea how well this product works because I did not even get to turn the device on.  There are some SERIOUS design flaws when it comes out of the box with the back cover popped open.  Apparently Motorola has not addressed the swelling battery issues with this model. Have I mentioned that it was not even turned on?  Steer clear of this POS.<br/><br/>(Please forgive the cruddy picture, it was taken on my old flip phone...go figure.)
So far so good. I'm running stock lollypop 5.1.1. This phone is butter smooth. Screen is bright and clear. Battery lasts all day, charges from 15 to 60 percent in 20 min. I'm running on T-Mobile and have WiFi calling capability.
Best phone I have had yet. Last phone was a note 2 and a droid maxx before that. With the case on it is just as big as the iphone 6plus so if you are concerned about size don't let that keep you from getting this great phone.
I've always loved the Nexus line of products, but after almost a month of ownership I'm still on the fence about whether or not it's too big for me. But otherwise it's a fantastic device, aside from some camera firmware bugs.
This is a great phone and it's a little too big.  When I'm on the phone I noticed my hand starts cramping because I have to over extend my hand to keep it from slipping.  Also the camera is not that great for taking pictures.
Upgraded from a Nexus 4, which I loved. I'm still fond of that phone, and have kept it as a backup...but this one is such an order of magnitude better.<br/><br/>LTE capable, an amazing display, and a much faster processor.
Battery life was really disappoint. I have a nexus 5 (which I use for international trips) and an iPhone 6 Plus (used on AT&T;). Both are far superior IMHO.<br/><br/>Amazon, as always, provided outstanding customer service.
Great phone for the price. Works perfectly on AT&T.; Just be aware that you will probably have to manually flash to Marshmallow since AT&T; gets<br/>in the way of the update. Kind of a bummer since this is an unlocked phone.
Pros:<br/>Great screen, long lasting battery, bloatware free, gets OS updates before non-Google devices, awesome speakers.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Camera software is garbage, video recording limited to 30fps even at 1080p.
Great phone for the price. The new one is out now, but I will be sticking with this one. It does everything I need and I don't see any reason to upgrade quite yet unless you need the latest and greatest every year.
Shipped quicker that I expected.  The phone updated to 5.1.1 Lollipop right away.  Now waiting for Marshmallow to install.  The phone meets all my expectations!  Unfortunately it will be my daughter's phone.  :-(
Awesome device. Very fast and responsive. I keep picking it up and admiring it. The pictures don't do it justice. You gotta hold this bad boy in your hand to start really feeling the love. Not a toy like iPhone.<br/><br/>P.S. Camera stinks.
This thing rocks my socks. It's awesome. Screen a is little big, but it's more pocketable than you'd expect. If you like android and staying up with updates this is the phone for you. Well designed. Great price
Huge phone. Worked great and looked cooler. Issues I had were with the OS which is on Google not the phone itself. Worth getting big time now that it has Android Marshmallow which is a God of smooth running.
Nice Phone! Very easy to operate, nice display and above all worth the money. The only problem is my phone produces a weird sound for a sec when I unlock the phone, that's the reason why I am giving 4stars.
What a phone! The size I want to view, read and play games with stunning clarity. Plus the latest Android Marshmallow operating system and all for a great price now it has just been superseded. I love it.
CRAZY MONSTER<br/>I love it, screen is beautiful took it out of the box put my at card, registered the IMEI With AT&T; and that's it. Its perfect. Thank god I picked this one over the gs6 or the iPhone 6
Or whatever was left of it after an unsuccessful attempt at removing it from what I guess. Other than that small annoyance, it is great! Especially after using the same smartphone for more than 3 years
Fast, nice screen, charges quickly, battery last a lot at least more than my nexus 5, sometimes I feels is so big but so far this is a good piece of hardware. Google please you should lower the price.
Coming off a Samsung Galaxy note edge and all I can say is wow. This phone is super fast and free of all bloatware best of all you get the latest Android software updates as soon as they come out.
This is the best phone I have ever had. Its rooted with custom ROM and its awesome, the reception is great batt life is great and screen is great. I would highly recommend this phone to everyone.
I got the 64gb model .... for 400 it represents exceptional value and performance. And unlike other phones ( One Plus) i didnt have to be on some exclusive list to buy it. Great deal great phone.
Easy to use and I like the option of adding my own apps. Much less junk to clutter up the memory & opporation of the phone. Nice size too. 2 of my coworkers asked about the phone & also liked it.
Best value for the money at $350.  It is a huge phone, excellent screen and audio quality.  Camera takes great picture.  Connectivity is great, connects to WIFI and cell data always at LTE speed.
I purchased this for my father, who had previously been using a Galaxy S-something. The larger screen is better for his failing eyesight, and, unlike the Samsung, is not chalk-full of bloatware.
What an amazing phone. I had the nexus 4 for two and a half years before it slowed down at all. Google products are the way to go! My phone is easy to use, beautiful display, good call quality.
This is a really solid phone. I've been making the move away from iPhones recently and this phone is making it very easy to never look back. Nice job Motorola. Nice job Google. Thanks very much
Got this to give my old eyes some relief. It'll take some getting used too as it's bigger than any phone I've ever had. Coming from a Windows phone, android is alien, but I'll get used to it.
Don't used any other brand Android phone beside Nexus!!! Other Android phone such as Samsung, LG, and so forth got a lot of junk software that degraded the phone performance and battery life.
I'm very happy with this phone. After a week of use I must say that it is a highly recommend phone for someone in the market for big screen phones. Fantastic big screen and good battery life.
Great phone - amazing screen. Super fast. Pure Android. Love everything BUT its just a little too big. It does not fit well in my pocket where I usually carry my phone. No other complaints.
Amazing phone, i have IPhone 6, bought this for my Mom and its lightning fast with awesome camera. Great phone, total value for phone. Very impressed with Motorola, this is comeback phone.
Best phone ever purchase
Great smartphone, no bloatware from Verizon and I can now control all the settings on my phone there by greatly increasing my phones run time. I can easily go 3 days running Chroma rom.
Unlocked, so no bloat-ware. Got all updates....FAST. Registered online with Verizon without issue. It's about time V caught on. Now if they can get rid of that old CDMA architecture...
Pros: It's superfast and doesn't lag anytime. Speakers are awesome.<br/><br/>Cons: Autofocus on camera is not that great. Part of the silver print on the back came off within a week.
Amazing phone.  Better than Apple brand any day.  Rugged and reliable.  A large screen with a respectable camera.  Kudos to Nexus.<br/>Product arrived on time and it was as expected.
Everything that I've used it for so far is as expected. The few downers are how quickly it heats up when running multimedia apps and not being able to connect with some wifi hotspots.
Best mobile I've ever owned - and I've been through a few.  It IS a little big, and takes some getting used to, but after a week or so, one-handed operation is still easily achieved.
This sale was a big hassle due to lacking info in description. This is the XT1103 phone and it will work with Project Fi. I just side loaded the Fi image and scrapped the T-Mo build.
Just bought one locally brand new in the box unlocked midnight blue and 32 GB, paid $600<br/>Great phone you won't be disappointed.
Love it! Using it on the project fi Google network. Phone fits me perfect. Its ergonomic shape fits my hand like a glove. Resolution and camera on par or better than apple iPhone 6.
Awesome phone. Got it on sale, so quite worth the price.  Very reliable, smooth and performant.  Only downside for me was having to switch from a micro sim card to a nano sim card.
Works perfectly fine, it's my first nexus and I'm loving it! The only thing I could complaint about is the fact that it didn't come with earphones, besides that, it's a great buy.
Great phone. Arrived a week late. But the phone is awesome. I used to have a Samsung Galaxy Mega, the nexus is a little smaller, but the quality is excellent. Just a better phone.
OK, here is an honest review of the Nexus 6. I had a Note 3 prior and decided to update my phone since AT&T; would not push Lollipop 5.0 to my Note 3. So, I found a Nexus 6 on eBay. I had a 2 week trial period before I could send it back so I committed to try it for 2 weeks under various situations and see what I thought. First, I was very leery of getting the Nexus 6 after reading online that some people were experiencing the device getting very hot, too hot to use. They would complain that the device got very hot while running multiple apps and the same time and while charging. I read some cases where the battery would get so hot the battery expanded and the back cover burst off. Anyways, I figured with a 2 week return policy and no restock fee what the heck I would try it. Here's the skinny. The size was no big deal to me after the Note's 5.7" screen. The device did get a little warm once but I was in a place where there was no A/C and it was very hot/humid and I was using it a lo... Read more
Excellent phone, definitely a great time to buy it, 64gb is more than enough for me. Screen has some yellow tints when it should be plain white, but I think that's a known issue.
Love it! My nexus 5 was dropped into water so I have to buy a new one.I still choose nexus cell phone. The camera is much better than 5 and the screen is much bigger. Good deal!
Great reception, signal strength is a lot more stronger than my last phone. Powerful hardware, haven't had any lagging issue so far. Large memory capacity comes in pretty handy.
What is there to say.......one heck of phone/mini tab!!!!<br/>It works flawless.....I immediately upgraded to 5.1 and again couldn't be more impressed and jumping for joy !!!!
Great product, delivery took shorter time Than expected. A bit dissapointed with the phone heating up quickly when using it, and the fact That it gets really hot when charging.
Using this on Google Fi. Love the phone. For a year old phone it is blazing fast. I have not encountered any stutter at all. It browses the web faster than my dual core laptop!
Great customer service, respond very quickly. At first I thought the phone was not working but I get it to work now and it is amazing. It was a gift for my Dad and he loves it.
Best battery life of any phone I've owned.  I can leave the brightness on full, use WiFi and Bluetooth all day long, and still have some battery left at the end of a long day.
This phone is enormous. It hurts my thumb to try to reach across it. Bought it to use with Google Fi. Getting used to it. Great to use sideways for movies or other videos.
I love my Nexus 6, best phone by far especially for a big person (I'm 6' 5'' 240 lbs). I can never go back to a smaller screen now, the 6 inch QHD screen is just too nice.
This is a really good device, the only downside for me was the fact of not coming with Android 6.0 and I'm still waiting for the OTA update. Besides that, I recommend it.
the best phone i ever owned..pure Android, big screen, battery last all day with medium use,udated to andriod 6.0, loud stereo front speakers, beautiful omled screen....
The phone came in great shape. No wear or tear, no issues with the phone at all either. ☺ The phone came earlier than I had expected and the owner was very corporative.
Fantastic PHONE!  Love it and can't wait to switch to Google Service as soon as it is available in my town!  Love this SO much more and my iphone and my Samsung Galaxy!
Love it, I came from the Samsung Line of phones (loved the Note line), which are still great, but with no bloatware this was perfect and many great features built in.
Awesome. Fast and very well crafted.<br/>Get some time to get used to not handle with one hand like my old nexus 5. The screen is gorgeous. I would prefer if hás 5.5
Amazing phone. Big size but you get used to it in a week's time and then can't get back to smaller screen size. Battery gets drained a bit too early but not too bad.
Great, not near as hot as other reviews said. Great speakers. Plenty of memory. Great sound quality. Great price while on sale!  No disappointments.<br/>T.Holloway
Love my new phone. Super fast and nice big screen. Better then my S4 and my BLU Studio 6.0 HD by far. Still in the learning stages of this phone but so far so good.
Amazing device, and price. Works flawlessly on ATT network. The missing star is for the lack of micro SD card slot, my kid's moto g 3rd gen has one, so no excuse.
If you like big phones this is the one. Awesome screen definition, great stereo sound with two front speakers, great performance even when updated to marshmallow.
love this phone, but the camera on it is not as good as what I've had with the LG3 or the Note3 & 5<br/><br/>hopefully the Nexus 6P will have a better cam
Everything I could ask for. New Nexus 6 at a great price. The phone is amazing. I ordered it for the Fi project and it rocks. I would recommend to anyone.
By far the best phone I ever used.  It has sold me on large phones.  I don't think id ever buy a phone smaller than 5.5" or one without stock android.
I love it, i' m fan of the nexus devices, since the galaxy nexus. This for me is the best phone in the market made for one is the best brands as Motorola.
I won't go into a bunch of detail about this phone since there are so many reviews already out there, both here on Amazon and all over the web, but I will say that this is an excellent phone.<br/><br/>I'm coming from having used nothing but Windows Phone and iOS devices and vanilla Android is great. I did briefly have a Moto G so I got a feel for Android from that phone, but it was just too slow (I think the lack of RAM was that phone's main problem) so I upgraded to this and it's great.<br/><br/>It's fast, takes good photos, doesn't have a bunch of carrier bloatware on it and is a very usable size (though I also think the Lumia 1520 is a usable size so take from that what you will). Really haven't had any complaints about it and the quick charge feature is just flat out awesome.<br/><br/>I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this phone to anyone.<br/><br/>Edit: Of all the phones I've owned over the years (from stuff like the Nokia N73 and N95 to the first iPhones, to various Windows Phones and now a handful of Android devices) this is the first one I've ever had a screen crack on. I'm not going to fault the phone for it, but I would just recommend being sure you get a case that offers great protection. My hand and arm twitched (due to a neurological disease I have) and the phone fell on the floor from a height of maybe three feet and the screen is just shattered and is now starting to come apart in tiny, very sharp pieces. So now I'm at a crossroads of whether I get another of these, upgrade to the 5X or 6P or get one of the new Lumias, but either way I'll be dropping some serious money to get any of them.
The ultimate balance between software optimization and hardware. Lag free and powerful with no bloatware. Unlocked and ready for use on any gsm carrier.
I've had it on the ATT network for about 4 days now. No issues with activation at my local ATT store.<br/><br/>She did say, " Oh we dont sell those, they are complicated ".  Yeah I know I said.  Thinking to myself,  our culture is conditioned to buy things designed for old people and 2 year olds that dont need much brain power to use. AKA IPHONES. ( Bleh! )<br/><br/>Anyway, my only complaint about the phone OS is that it wont let me change the volume of TXT msg independent of the ringer volume. Hopefully this will be updated sometime.<br/><br/>My screen boot up only says ANDROID.  I know some people were complaining about ATT or something splashing on their screens, but this one did not.  However I turned it on and completed the setup prior to going to the ATT store.  Maybe this is the trick to preventing the ATT logo.
it will suddely crash, especially when you're using camera. i don't know why. fortunately, it works better recently. tips: i use it in china mainland.
Its huge has a great screen with bright colors! Its fast and lollipop is by far the best mobile os so far
Really a great phone, and thank you amazon for shipping to China. (to google: you still need lots of work to do on camera, big gap with Apple iSight)
Perfect for my husband with huge hands. Converted my iphone addicted husband to android. THANK YOU! Oh yeah, and it gave me a little phone envy too.
I Love the 6 inch HD screen & stereo front facing speakers! Nexus is the best! I love getting the newest version of Android right when it comes out!
Extremely happy with my purchase. I upgraded from a Galaxy 3. I'm connected through project fi. This is a monster phone, especially at this price.
The system of this cellphone is a little lag and the battery is very hot. Basically, you should in-charge the phone twice or even more every day.
Phone is great.  Quite a bit bigger than what I was used to with the Samsung Galaxy S5.  I thought it was a great deal and phone arrived quickly.
Love my Nexus 6! My husband bought one in August and then I had to have one. Glad I waited a couple months because I purchase mine for $150 less!
Contrary to the description the phone does work on Verizon. Removed the SIM card from my Moto X and installed in the Nexus 6. Works like a champ.
Everything was ok. The seller send the phone very quickly. It's a very good phone and everything run ok. I recommend the product and the seller.
Super display. Easy to use, and works with Verizon (US model). Just had to put my SIM card from old phone in and good to go. This thing is huge!
I received the phone and the forward facing camera does not work but I don't feel like going with our a phone for two weeks so I'll deal with it
Awesome looking phone, fast, beautiful screen, with all the power from Motorola and Google. Beware because for some people it could be too big.
I bought this phone for my husband. He loves it! The phone is well made, and the handwriting inputs of foreign languages are fast and accurate.
Another quality product futon Motorola paired with the Google pure Android experience.<br/>The only drawback I've good is limited accessories.
I LOVE THIS PHONE.
works like a dream
True luxury, these phones may spoil you for anything else.<br/><br/>My second Nexus 6 because I'm stocking up to keep these for years. Expansive, glorious display, fast, responsive CPU and gorgeous, liquid GPU. This is the finest phone I have ever owned and truly replaces my PC/Mac in every way - and travels in my pocket! Don't need glasses to read the status bar and entire web pages display and if not, the lightning-fast CPU zooms in and out with nary a stutter. Fits comfortably in my hand and can do 0ne-handed scrolling with little effort. The wireless Qi charging spoils me for anything else, but in the rare times (once in 6 months) when I'm caught short on power, the Motorola Turbo Charger tops off the battery FAST.<br/><br/>Carries the full Motorola US warranty, but not the Google Drive or Play Music bonuses. At this price, I was okay that:)
Excellent phone. Overall satisfied with it. Ultimately decided it wasn't the phone for me because it was too difficult to hold with one hand.
Best no contract unlocked phone out there.  Stock Android, durable, plenty of space for what you need.  For the prices on here it's a steal.
Love this phone, Finally a phone you can root and get early OS updates on Verizon.<br/><br/>Fast, Great screen, ok camera, ok battery life
A BIG Phone!!! I love the clean Android without all the unwanted apps!!! Did I say this Phone is BIG!!! It will take some getting use to...
Decent phone but the battery life sucks.  I also wish thebpowe button was not on the side.  It's touchy and right where i grab the phone
I really thought this cell phone would be too big for me, but after a few weeks it feels completely normal.  Very snappy, no complaints.
Everything i want
Amazing phone for the price does everything you wanted to do the screen resolution is amazing photos look great this phone is a beast!!
Comes with a developer preview build. Won't update to the latest firmware unless flash it back to stock. Once that done, pure android !
Every thing about it is good, I was Lumia user and was very much comfortable with Win8.1 phone... Few hiccups @ first.. Now comfortable
Worst battery life. It's not surviving even for a day. I don't watch videos or do video chat.
I am enjoying this phone immensely. So much better than my old Apple 4 Iphone. It's almost like having a mini-ipad within your reach.
Great phone!  It's 2015, but this late 2014 still runs strong.  Google has already pushed the Marshmallow 6.0 update to this device.
Absolutely love this phone. I have been a iPhone user for many years but this phone is so far above and beyond anything I expected.
Love the phone. I guess I got the version in line last for updates though but its still great. Much more manageable than expected
Great cellphone!
Very nice phone with BIG bright screen<br/>And a great value<br/>Very hard to find screen protection, so buy one with online.
Screen display clarity is amazing.  Phone is blazing fast and despite its bulk able to use with one hand thanks to curved back.
Great phone. Love the larger screen fits well in my hand. Highly recommended for those wanting a great phone at a great price.
Great Phone - bright screen.  First use - it seems oversized, but now all other phones look tiny.  No lockups or slow downs -
I've owned the Nexus 4, 5, 6 and 7. The Nexus 6 is definitely an outlier out of the bunch. The Nexus 4 and 5 both gave the feeling that I was using an inexpensive, but loaded device. The Nexus 6 does not feel like that at all. It feels like a premium phone.<br/>The Camera is substantially better than the Nexus 5 camera, though it doesn't hold a candle to some of the other flagship phones out there.<br/><br/>I can say that what it lacks in the camera department it amply makes up for with the strong processor, large screen and 3gb of ram.<br/><br/>If you can get used to the large screen size, you'll almost be disappointed to move back to a 5" screen like the Nexus 5.
This is a great phone, totally unlocked.  Works great and still fits in my shirt pocket.  Went from Nexus 5 to this Nexus 6.
This phone is excellent, no lags at all. I like it till now, The good thing about this phone is the screen size and clarity.
Nice phone, well worth the money.  Highly recommend.  Fast, clear resolution, strong battery.  What more could you ask for?
its a gift so i don't know how is it.<br/><br/>But my brother had it before and I loved it except the size.<br/>Too big.
took longer to arrive than what i expected but its the us version as they advertise and the price is the best in the market
This version can't be activated on Verizon. Sad, but Verizon only has the Midnight Blue version (for now).  Great phone!!!
Working with Verizon, just transfer your card, get reception, no Verizon or 3rd party apps, stock Google, Lollipop 5.1.1.
My first real smartphone, great quality, really large phone (slightly larger than a closed nintendo 3ds xl for reference)
Premium feel and hasty updates... I'll have a difficult time ever returning to a smaller display after using this device!
Great phone. It's a Nexus so you always have the latest from google. This phone has an amazing camera, if you are worried about bad low-light shots HDR+ and the dual-LED flash compensate for this. My recommended case would be a <br/> This phone has left me with 40-50% battery when going to bed. Definetely a good choice for this price after 2015's disappointing flagships.
I had a Samsung Note 2, a phone that was released 2 years before and it worked much better. I'm returning mine after having it for a month.<br/><br/>The low-light camera is basically non-existant, I don't even try to take pictures at night anymore.<br/><br/>Also, I had a problem where my phone decided to stop sending out text messages and receiving messages, I had no idea it was doing it. I was making people mad, and getting mad at people for unresponsiveness. I had to reset my phone and once I did, I received all the messages at once. I've only had this phone a month, in today's fast-paced, hyper-connected world that is just not acceptable haha.
so far so good.
Beautiful Phone
I love my new phone.  Having this phone enabled me to join the Google Fi network.  I also love how clear the screen is.
I always like to use a mobile phone with best specs and performance and, Google nexus 6 fullfils all that requirement.
Works just like the nexus 5 I replaced, except screen bigger and a few minor system improvements. I love this phone!!!
Awesome phone for the reduce price.  Glad i waited and it was a giant upgrade to my Nexus 5 (still an awesome phone!).
I love my nexus 6.. Love the size.. The picture is great.. And the phone is fast... Best of all its A GOOGLE phone :)
Nice screen, no bloats, little big for me, activated this unlocked phone on verizon without any issue and works great
HUGE screen, fast and nothing but pure Google! No junk/bloatware attached! I couldn't ask for a lot more in a phone.
Everything run smooth, great value in this price. I prefer select nexus 6 other than the new generation nexus model.
Arrived in good condition. Phone works well.
It was OK. The camera didn't meet my expectations. The rest of the phone is very fluid and the screen is brilliant.
Legit IMEI. Brand New U.S. carrier compatible. Put a T-Mobile sim card and it works like a charm. Fast shipping!!!!
This is a great phone!  Can not be beat for the price, and the support that goes along with this phone is awesome.
What a great phone. I'm normally a Samsung user, but the nexus 6 is super snappy and I really like the feel of it.
It takes time for starting up, some times suddenly needs restart and after restart takes up too 5 min to recover.
It is good phone - although did not realize how big it is till I got it.<br/>The camera could do with an upgrade
My husband has almost 1 month using it and he is very happy with it. The speed,  screen and sound are very good.
Shipped well on time, great phone and with the discount it was a great deal. $350 even in 2015 is a total steal.
Love this phone! Size is just right. Screen is perfect size. Pictures are brilliant. Best phone purchase ever!
a great phone and an insanely speedy delivery i got it 2 days after i ordered it i recommend it to everyone :)
I love very fast and responsive work with my attorney sim card I randomly switch between my note 4 and nexus 6
Hi the cell phone is greatttt!!!! But I need the Invoice for the cell phone can you send me please, Thank You.
I was using a Samsung sIII and compared to the power and how long the batteries lasts its better in every way.
I love Nexus devices and this one is no different. I was concerned about the 6in size when I ordered but that went away quickly. I even tried goinf back to my Moto X 2nd gen which is 5.2in. I could not do it.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Battery live could be better<br/><br/>Pros<br/>Beautiful Screen<br/>Dual front speakers are great for watching videos<br/>Stock Android is so much faster, consistent, user friendly than the OEM skins that Samsung, LG, HTC etc put on phones.<br/>Fast updates to next versions of Android<br/>Finally a camera that does not feel way behind other phones.
Great phone for the price. Big vibrant screen plus all the android bells and whistles. I would buy it again.
Check reviews on YouTube. Things to remember:  omelet screen , size of the phone, compatible with project fi
Great price for a Nexus phone. Finally I can enjoy monthly software updates without waiting for the carrier.
Excellent phone. Shipped fine, received fine. The nexus 6 is everything you wish an android phone could be.
Awesome phone!! Works great with MetroPCS ! A top of the line phone with Unlimited 4G LTE .. Can't beat it
Got mine and it was US version.  Was able to hook up with Project FI with no issues.  Works great so far.
Great phone!!
awesome phone, even when it has a really large screen it fits well in pant's pocket, so all good for me!
2 months into this phone, really loving it..especially the stick Android experience and the performance
Great Price, and pure Android experience. Would be better if OTA comes as fast as other Nexus devices.
Great phone! Very fast and has a really nice screen. Nexus for life! Has 4G LTE for T-Mobile and AT&T.;
This is a Christmas present for my son. He picked it out. He was so excited. It is a beautiful phone.
It is big and so I love it. The battery is also strong, which can last a full day under normal usage.
As a previous Nexus 5 owner this was a great upgrade!  The only thing I miss is a notification light.
cant find anything better than this. unbeatable price, i got 64GB model for only $399. Thanks Amazon!
While this Nexus 6 is advertised as unlocked, mine arrived locked! Since I know what to do about that, it was not a serious issue. If you don't have the skills, or software, to unlock the phone, double check everything when you first turn the phone on. Otherwise, this phone is an excellent product. I bought this one for my wife. I had paid full price for mine, so the reduced cost was a super plus. We are now both on Google's Project Fi. The Nexus 6 was required for that service. Because it's Motorola, it will last for a very long time.
There is a Google Nexus Help discussion, called "Nexus 6 Data Connection Failure - Cross carrier, location and OS Version", which details a huge problem with these phones.  Search for it on google - I don't think I can link to external sites here.<br/><br/>They cannot keep LTE data signals.  In fact, sometimes I go from LTE to no data at all in my own house - I just can't connect to my T-mobile network.<br/><br/>It's a huge known issue, and Google has done NOTHING to fix it - it's been known since May.<br/><br/>Avoid
Great phone, great price. This is my 5th Nexus product and I love it. Pure Android experience without the bloatware.
Big phone, with awesome response. Huge quality screen and great camera.<br/>All that I want it
Best deal on any phone out there. This phone is terrific! Amazing battery life on marshmallow!
These are beautiful phones.  Comes clean with no Carrier garbage apps preloaded.  Very nice.
Great phone at 500. A little big for my taste but the screen is amazing. Best android phone.
I love this phone. Big bright clear screen. Fast processor. Lollipop 5.0. Very happy so far.
Big and I love it. It has a BEAUTIFUL screen and so much space. I am playing so many games!
It came on time and no scratches or dents with the phone. A great buy. Loving pure Android!
New device right out of the box could not charge even though the lightning bolt indicator is there. Battery management shows "Not charging". Contacted tech support and they had no idea why this happened. Switched between different chargers/cables/PCs, and none helped. The USB connection looked fine, and I was able to transfer files between PC and phone using the USB cable. Battery drained to 10% while it was plugged... Then I finally gave up and initiated return request.
Bought 2 of these... US version DOES work on Verizon!! No problem what so ever activating.
Great Value
Great phone
Nice phone!
Buyer Beware!<br/><br/>1. It was not made clear that this phone is the International Version that will not work on T-Mobile LTE network in the US, although it does connect to HSPA. Since the Turbo-Charger is made in Europe, the package includes an adapter for US electrical outlets. It would have been nice to have all this sufficiently explained up front.<br/>2. Also,this phone seems to have a problem charging on the Qi wireless charger I have been using with other Nexus 6 phones.<br/>3. The back cover has tiny spots that cannot be washed off. This is annoying if you're expecting a brand new, pristine product.<br/>I am disappointed and I am returning this phone immediately.
The phone works like a dream. Very please and looking forward to getting one for my wife.
Great phone and amazing quality. Motorola makes a solid phone that will not let you down
Value. Good thing. Go longer and charge less with 3220 mash battery and turbo charging.
Greatest cellphone ever. All the Iphone hype is not worth the money having this choice.
Excellent choice for a great smartphone, cheap and useful, I'm happy with this purchase
Great phone takes beautiful photos, speaker in front instead of back, nice size screen.
The camera cannot work recently, and it reports mistakes when I open it. I dislike it.
I updated from the Nexus 5 to the Nexus 6 (not the Nexus 6P). No buyer's remorse here.
I have been a Nexus user for a while, but I have up my Nexus 4 at the end of last year for an HTC One M8. After a few months I really missed the Nexus experience, so I sold the HTC and got this Nexus 6. This is the best phone that I've ever had and would be real close to perfect if the battery just lasted longer. It usually makes it through the day, but I would like to see a couple of days of use with a battery as large as the one on this phone.
Make sure u purchased the US version model item 00632NARTL ... phone was unresponsive
great phone completely brand new, I have used it for a week and I am in love with it.
There isn't much on how to use the phone. You just have to use it and figure it out.
Super sweet phone. But, it is frigging huge. Does not fit well in any pants pocket.
Great phone, One minor problem is it become hotter when I use it for too long time.
Good solid phone, definitely priced just right a real bargain. Highly recommended.
Would have gave it 5 stars but I didn't receive any kind of manual for this phone.
Phone is awesome , the shipping was fast. I'm using the phone to write this review
Loving it!
It's BIG and full of power. Easy phone that doubles as a tablet. Awesome product!
Amazing phone. Very fast and I love the front speakers. Turbo charging kicked ass
I like it! It's high-resolution display comes with the latest version of Android.
Got two of these on Black Friday on sale for $200, great phone for great prices!
Great phone! Not recommended for hobbits or any type of person with small hands.
Great price for a great alphabet. Fast and responsive. Battery could be better.
I got this phone only to find out that the camera was not working, each time i try to use it, it keep showing ''Can't Connect To Camera''.., I have since returned it about 2 weeks ago, and Amazon have not contacted me about my refund, I was very disappointed,...., i lost money and i lost phone, my dream phone ended up being my worst nightmare.., i just hope i still get back my refund anytime soon....
Nice phone ,so I update to Android newest version, so it maks good experence.
It is really tight on the phone but I suppose it has to be to protect it.
This phone with Android 6.0 is marvellous experience. Highly recommended.
Amazing phone and really fast performance, i just hate the curved design.
Excelent phone. The price doesn't reflect what this phone is capable of.
very good phone but shipping to Nigeria cost more than 12 thousand naira
Absolutely fabulous. Now has the Marshmallow update. Great hardware too!
I was a bit weary, but couldn't pass up the $399 price. One word, BEAST!
From nexus 5 to nexus 6. I love this thing. Huge but you get used to it.
Wonderful, reliable, easy to use, and the best phone I have ever used!
The product is too good, but problem is weight. its too much weighted.
Excellent phone<br/>This is my second phone. I have gifted to my son.
Big, Fast & good battery life. As with any Nexus it has no SD slot :-(
Yes... It is the phone which is worth to be got.. I like it very much.
Shipped quickly and exactly as described. Worked on Verizon Wireless.
Overall outstanding phone!  Great replacement phone at a great price.
fantastic phone, excellent condition, very much recommended!!! *****
Best phone ever. Huge screen, great weight, perfect for my big hands
Customer service attitude is very good, is the logistics slow point.
Phone is good but i have a problem with speakers and headphones Port
Great deal for a great phone... with Great Service from Amazon.com!!
Feels very big at first but you will get use to it. LOVE THIS PHONE.
Great phone. Love the size and speed. Delivered promptly and safely.
Nice smart phone and great OS<br/>But the voice recognition is weak
Awesome phone. Quick change over with At&t.; Uses the micro SD card.
item come in with surface NOT clean<br/>pricing kept dropping ....
Very easy to root! simply unlock the bootloader in the menu, install windows drivers, run CF autoroot, done!<br/><br/>I love not having all the bloatware from the cell provider. The stereo speakers sound great. Battery life is comparable to my old note 3. The camera app is lacking. Would be nice to have 60fps camcorder like my old note 3.
The phone is great but my front camera does not work, already try with Motorola support service but the problem persist. Return the phone it's really complicated for me because I am not from USA, so this sucks :/
i liked the phone except fast battery drain and it freeze sometime
Awesome phone, easy to use, great versatility for everyday needs.
I am so disappointed with all the audio issue it comes along, and it was performing way slower than i was expected.
A steal for $350. Still up to par with the 2 newer Nexus devices.
The phone is great, but the battery does not last even half a day
A little bigger for me,and battery can't support more than 1 day~
Arrived before estimated date & everything is working as promised
love it so far. was an iphone user. can't beat the current price.
Nice super fast phone... It is an extremely good deal at $350...
Wow, what a difference than my last phone. This thing is great!
Thought it would be too large at first, but its just right size
Pros:<br/>This phone is pretty superb in terms of build quality<br/>Clean unskinned Android OS is competitive with iOS on almost every level<br/>Excellent battery life<br/>Amazing sound with stereo speakers<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>A bit too large for my everyday use<br/>Display color saturation honestly hurt my eyes.<br/>Camera doesn't shoot RAW out of the box<br/>OS sometimes made it difficult to find settings<br/>no Micro-SD slot<br/>no fingerprint sensor<br/><br/>Android fans will find this phablet well equipped and comfortable, didn't turn out to be my cup of tea coming from an iPhone 6, I returned it.
if you are in korea remember that it can`t support lte-advance
very good. hope the battery will be keep good after some time.
The phone is great and I had no problem with the transaction.
Picked it up for my grandson and he is happy with his choice.
Once you get used to the size, the phone is wonderful to use.
12 days, i achieved the phone. it is so beautiful. thank you!
It's good phone, but poor design. Too heavy and isn't elegant
This phone has not been the best I've ever had but it is the one that works on Google Fi. The battery life is lacking and that is my main complaint. The rapid charger is a great thing, I highly recommend investing in the car rapid charger. Other than that, it's a normal phone. Good investment, could be better.
I love it. It is an excellent phone. Beyond my expectations.
I just got the nexus 6 and I LOVE IT! Every aspect! MetroPCS users don't be afraid, works perfect with this carrier. I Replaced my micro Sim with a nano Sim in a profesional MetroPCS store only with trained technicians. Everybody there was in love with my phone! An SD card slot would have been perfect.
I bought this phone on sale. The speaker of the first phone I got would make a clicking/popping noise when the vibrator spun. The noise was not a system noise, and would happen with the volume turned down/muted. The noise would occur mostly when texting/typing, however it could be heard when pressing the back button (or doing anything that made the phone vibrate) The only way to stop the noise was to turn off the phone vibrations.<br/><br/>I called amazon and they sent me a replacement. The replacement makes the same noise. I'm on my second replacement, and it's still making the noise. When I call Motorola, they tell me they've never heard of the issue, but I can send it in, and if they hear the noise, they'll replace it. Or I can pay $25 to have it replaced without testing. This is unacceptable. I will never buy another Motorola product again. This is supposed to be a flagship phone. It's a pile of crap. Don't waste your money.
Great phone! Love the camera quality and the battery life..
love it
The phone is beautiful, blazing fast and stunning overall.
you know what brought you to this phone... buy it already.
When i use wechat or qianniu,volume so low.whatsapp same?
Bought from google would be perfect with a larger battery
Fast, speedy phone. Great upgrade of my my galaxy note 2.
Though onbtge bigger side it does serve all my purposes.
Simple to use and pure google experience is much better!
Although the performance is OK, the camera is not good.
Works like a charm and sometimes lasts couple days.
Too big for one hand operation otherwise nice phone
Only downside: it's a little too big.  Great value.
This is a really nice phone.  I'm glad I bought it.
Great great phone to use... Met all my expectations
Great!
Love this phone!!!!!!!! The size is just pleasing.
Best phone for the price. It really can't be beat.
This phone is big, however it is an amazing phone.
Great hardware, battery life not so great though.
It's gorgeous and the best phone I've got so far.
Fantastic phone, I'd never go back to another one
Good phone. Exactly as described. I recommend it
love the phone great condition, buy if you can.
My first Nexus phone. And I like it. Thank you.
It's great for the price. Definitely recommend.
Extremely good phone and delivered well on time
Yes,its xt1103.it can work on China-telecom 4G.
works just fine on Verizon.  why pay $300 more?
I am very happy with this item. This phone replaces my Nexus 5 that 'died'. The Nexus 6 is larger, has a better camera and front facing speakers for better sound. Very happy to buy it now at $350 rather than the $650 intro price.
Great  phone for the money. Screen is awesome.
Great phone, delivered on time and as expected
I don't like a big case, this case is perfect.
Best deal every. ..awesome  very happy with it
very great phone for stock android enthusiasts
Product seems very good. I would like to try.
Had the previous 2 generations of Nexus Devices, by far this is the best one i have ever owned, if you love the pure android experience, timely software updates, and an amazing screen, this is the phone you want to have.
So much better than my Samsung Galaxy Note 3
Looks great and is real metal. Great price!
Best case for this phone, great purchase!!!
At the price of $349, Nexus 6 is marvelous.
The quality seems good. It can be trusted.
I need charge it everyday, but I like moto
My wife is very happy with this new phone.
I love it but haven't got my update to 6.0
Very good, but power consumption too fast.
Love it...so much better than my iPhone!!!
I love it! Could ask for a better phone .
best since samsung Galaxy S  111 went out
I broke the screen :( it says us warranty so does that mean I can return it and get a new one?
Great product. Exactly what was announced
Love this phone!! It is big but love it!!
I like nexus 6. Good price. Good quality.
great powerful mobile with a great value
The best phone I've ever used.I like it!
Couldn't ask for a better Android phone.
Best deal in Town awesome phone period.
I love the premium feel of this phone.
Shipping as expected. Correct product.
look good I'm thinking buying one soon
Best Phone ever. Google does it right!
Bought it for Google FI. Works great.
great phone, it's better than Sony Z3
Wonderful screen and smooth operation
The best android smart phone till now
Excellent wish it had direct connect.
This phone is amazing.  I returned the LG nexus 5x to opt to last years google flagship and I am not disappointed.  I truly believe this is the best smartphone out for the price.
Great product , cant wait to have it
best cell phone ever, great seller !
Great phone, just buy it if you can!
I can't recommend this phone enough!
It's very good and I'm happy with it
Battery backup is not up to the mark
Great media phone. Fast and reliable
item as described; recommend to all.
I love everything about this phone!
It's working as per my expectations
I like the phone .its working good.
Excelent,  everything OK, very fast
Phone was great while it lasted. I bought this phone on 10/24/2015 and took my about a week getting it set up because of SIM card issues (my fault). then on 09/30/2015 the battery was depleted and the phone died and would not charge anymore. I tried everything the support people told me to do and nothing worked. upon further review this happens pretty often when the battery is depleted. What kind of terrible design makes it so that your battery powered electronic device will STOP WORKING FOREVER because it runs out of battery? I have spent hours with tech support and they took up hours of my time because they would not forward me to who i needed to speak to. yeah so, TL:DR THIS PHONE WILL TRY TO KILL ITSELF PERMANENTLY EVERY TIME IT RUNS OUT OF BATTERY. EVERY DAY IS RUSSIAN ROULETTE FOR THIS PHONE.
Super great phone for this money!!
Very good phone and fast delivery.
I purchased this cellphone and it was defected, I contacted Motorola, and they asked me to send it back. Now they are refusing to pay the customs and receive it.
motorola nexus 6 was a good deal.
Packed nicely and reached safely.
Nearly perfect, just kind of huge
Great phone, worth the investment
I looove this phone, huge screen, very fast system and great shape to fit in hands. The system does seem to freeze or crash when I have gmail and chrome open.
love it, best mobile i ever used
This is a very good pphone!phone
I am very happy with my phone.
Isn't expensive and works fine
Works great delivered on time.
The good:<br/>-Excellent battery life<br/>-Nice, big, excellent quality screen<br/>-Very fast<br/><br/>The bad:<br/>-Reboots by itself. This seems to be a very common problem with these devices - they tend to reboot for many different reasons and you will find many different solutions which may or may not work for you.<br/>-It's just too big. Real awkward to have in your pocket. I'd return it if it weren't for it being the only phone supported by project fi<br/><br/>Mine has a hardware problem where it reboots by itself whenever it goes to sleep/triggers some sort of sleep mode when it is unplugged. Others have reboot problems too, but not to this degree. Doesn't happen 100% consistently, but once it starts, it doesn't stop until it is plugged into a power source. I was trying to troubleshoot the problem by recording its logs using aLogRec from google play to see what is logged prior to a reboot; however, the simple act of having it running saving logs to the sdcard results in this full sleep mode never being activated, and therefore the bug+reboot does not occur. Leaving aLogrec running does not adversely affect battery life, perhaps 10% per day. Try that if you're having issues and none of the existing solutions seem to work.
I had used Nexus 5 for a year. It was a great phone. The on/off button started giving me problems, so, since I already had the phone for a year, I "upgraded" to Nexus 6 a month ago. NOT A GOOD THING.<br/><br/>Two days ago it started heating up, I turned it off. Then, it just cannot be turned off without having to hard reset the thing to be able to use it again.<br/><br/>DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE! On top of it, Motorola's customer service is horrible! Basically, if you have a problem, they're nice to you, but cannot help you. You have to send the phone for repairs, to see if they fix it, or give you a new one. And there you go: 1 month with no phone!
Huge screen and it's durable.
fits nicely in my bear hands.
Great phone for the price....
As Described, Fast shipping .
Great phone at Good price....
Great phone with great price.
the price is very reasonable!
Quality build, prompt delivery and well packaged.  large phones are not for everyone, but I had a Sprint Samsung Galaxy Note 3 so the switch-over has been pretty easy.  I bought a Ringke case because it has a small loop to connect a lanyard . I added a Pleson screen protector for added security (I hope.)  I bought it to use with Google's Project Fi.  The Nexus 6 Motorola is one of three phones that will work with Project Fi.  With newer versions out, this discounted phone was within my budget.  It seems to be well built  I only had it for a day when Google updated to Android 6.  Samsung took a leisurely 5 months to update to Android 5.  Customer support is WITHOUT PEER!  Imagine talking to a human being within minutes of contacting them (they will call you back, too.)  FYI, Project Fi has the same great customer service.  The camera works well, and with Camera FV-5, takes RAW images- a big selling feature for me.  Why not 5 stars?  I haven't had it long enough to see how it well it handles being out in the world, i suspect it will be fine but who knows?  I will update my rating as it is warranted.  So far, very happy camper.
Excellent phone, no problems
Best phone ever, so far.  :)
Great phone as you'd expect.
Excellent phone great sound
It's a powerful Smartphone.
What a great deal!  A very good price for a phone that still holds it's own spec-wise in comparison with new flagship devices.
Good case. Thin and light.
Great phone,  Great price!
Love it, love it, love it.
Thanks Amazon!! I am happy
Great phone for the price!
This is the 64GB version of CloudWhite nexus 6. No doubt about it.
Love it!<br/>Really fast
Really good and worth it.
I really love this brand.
Great Phone all around...
The best phone I ever had
i love it. work very well
Awesome phone all around.
What... the. What even. I don't. Sentences grammar can't I even now.<br/><br/>You can't expand storage with a MicroSD card. I have a 128GB MicroSD card sitting here with my entire music collection, a million great pictures, and... I can't use it. I didn't even think to check this before ordering the phone. What phone in 2015 would not have a MicroSD slot capability?!<br/><br/>I guess I'll stick with the phone, since Samsung's gear broke after only 2.5 weeks of use (so I'm giving up on Samsung), but I'm really disappointed in this.
very nice bought at $349
Good value for money now
Overall a decent phone on it's own. If you're migrating from the Galaxy Note series prepare to be underwhelmed.
For the past 2 months works perfectly. There are a lot of bugs with ringing and dtmf which is part of android.
The black siding on the case is starting to fall off.  I've had the product 5 weeks and it is falling apart.
My son is happy with it
Excellent cell phone. The presentation, software, hardware are perfect. I recommended this cell phone.
I highly recommend it.
good phone. Works well
everything is perfect
I became tired of being frustrated with the Samsung Note 2 and decided I needed to update. I didn't know much about the Nexus but the quality of the camera and the fact that it was on sale for $0.00 with a plan made it an easy decision to buy. I have had it for about a month now and love it. The only criticism is that it takes forever to boot up. Otherwise it is worth six stars.<br/>It has been two months and alas as in all love affairs there have been some bumps on the way. One feature that drives me nuts is the placement of the on/off button. If you hold the phone in your right hand there is no problem. However, if I hold it in my left hand for texting the middle finger or the index finger inevitably keeps hitting the on/off button.<br/>But as in all relationships one must accept the flaws in the other. Still love the phone.
Very pleased indeed!
Excellent smartphone
Excelent product !!!
very good I like it.
Everything perfect!!
I like the phone, but just like anything else a new release is on the way after purchase.
Excellent device!!!
I loved this phone.
Fit my expectations
I ordered the Nexus 6 when Amazon offered it at half price.  There is no way I could afford the original price of $600!  But at $360 I jumped at it.  I was looking for a large 6" phone and this fits the bill.  It is a pretty nice phone.  I do miss a notification light, vibration as it turns on and it is slippery in the hand, minor things that I can do without.  The screen is beautiful, bright and clear, the sound is fantastic, loud and not tinny as most phones are.  It is pure Google Android which I like.  Very easy to operate.  The battery life could be a bit better, but I do get a full day of heavy use.  All in all a nice phone.  Nothing extraordinary but a nice phone.  Glad I bought it for the much lower cost.  Thank you Amazon!
Got this phone after my previous phone was stolen, was going to go for an iPhone (haven't owned an iPhone for 2 years) but came upon this one and being last years model the price was so low I couldn't pass on it. I'm happy I chose this phone, the pure Android experience is completely superior to what Samsung offers (I was tired of touchwiz, that's why I was going back to iphones).<br/><br/>At this price it's hard to beat. All apps work great and fast, camera is good, and battery lasts longer than my previous phone (Samsung note 3). One thing to consider is if you set up a pop account to the gmail app it will drain your battery twice as fast, sometimes faster. So I set gmail to inbox and set the pop account to cloudmagic.
I like this phone.
Very very pleased.
Totally satisfied.
Love my new Nexus!
Yes, this phone is overpriced at this time, but that does not make it a bad phone!  The Nexus 6 has all of the things I wanted in a cell phone and more.  Going to wait until the price goes down a bit and upgrade all of the phones on my plan to this great phone!
Before I ordered the device I checked the review on this phone. It was recommended by google for Proj Fi and ca do calling thru wifi. Now I have this device and use it on the Tmobile, which also have wifi calling as one of the partners of google on Proj Fi. It does not work on WiFi calling at all.<br/><br/>I called motorola since they sold the device and Tmobile since they are the carrier to resolve my problem. I picked this device for the  WiFi calling and what a waste of money if I can not have this capability on the phone.<br/><br/>It drains the battery so quick that I need to keep it plug while in the office.<br/> if I can have Wifi calling I can give a higher rating.
I love this phone! I got it a few weeks ago and it is so much better than my Galaxy S4. It runs Android very smoothly and the screen size is amazing. I had to get used to it but having a 6 inch screen makes it so much easier to type emails and see apps. I am very glad I got this phone and would recommend it to anyone who is looking and trying to figure out what kind of phone they want. Also love how fast the charging is with the charger it comes with. It can be very low on battery and charge up to full in less than 2 hours. I have not yet tried wireless charging with it but the charger it comes with is so great, I do not know if I will need it. So far, it is an amazing phone!
excellent product
Really good deal!
PERFECT CELLPHONE
Fast, i loved it!
My perfect phone.
Really nice phone
Really good value
Works great!! Had no issue getting Verizon to get the Sim issue resolved.
Excelent phone !
love this phone,
nice cell phone!
I'm not an overly tech savvy guy, so I can't write a decent review. But I can tell you that I wanted this phone for a while and that I couldn't be happier with what I got. There are probably phones with better specs at a slightly higher price point, but I think that the fact that this is Google's phone just makes it too good for it's competition. The reliability of updates and the optimization just make it amazing. It might be too large for some people, but the huge screen makes it excel when viewing videos, photos or even reading a book. I am just too happy with it to write anything bad.
Very good phone
Love the phone.
Excellent deal!
Good, Very Good

Very nice phone
Love the large screen, the  build quality, the reception, the durability and almost everything about the phone.  If I could just get rid of the lag it would be amazing.  I moved to the Nexus 6 from a Nexus 5 and was very disappointed to get this kind of lag.  I have had all the Nexus devices since the Nexus one and this is the first time I have had this kind of experience. One of the main reasons for getting a Nexus device is that the software is clean and you get crisp response.  Unfortunately that doesn't happen on this device even with the latest software updates.
Amazing screen and pure google experience is worth every penny!
As advertised.
Working Great!
I love this!!!
Simply amazing
Awesome phone!
Solid phone choice since switching over from IPhone. There was a bit of discomfort of adjusting to Android versus IOS, but I'm adaptable. The experience with phone has been phenomenal. It's fast, screen looks brilliant, and it just feels like a grown man's phone!
Awesome price

This is a beast of a phone.  For $400 for the 64 gig you won't find a better value.  The screen is rather large but you adjust fast to it.  The voice controls are some of the best I've seen at a phone.  I put a cricket SIM card in it and am very happy with the speeds I am getting ( $60 for 10 gig of LTE makes my wallet happy also).  This phone has all the top of the line specs you would expect with the exception of the fingerprint scanner.  This is still an amazing phone and is worth way more than $400
I love it battery life is good I love the larger screen. I was concerned before I got it was going to be too big to fit in my pocket but it fits find the tapered edges on the phone make it seem not nearly as big as it is in your pocket. The only problem I had was the stock charger that came with the phone  this is super fast boost charger and overheated the phone while charging. so I have stopped using the stock charger and use  my old charger haven't had any problems since.
Battery life could be better, everything else I like.
Great phone!
I love Nexus
Good enough.
Great Phone!
Is Great!!!!
Working good
Great phone.
I love my new phone.  But I am not a picky person with phones.  It makes phone calls, great.  It does texting to multiple people.  I like that.  Had really hard time with my old phone because it did not.  The camera seem good - another plus.  It is quite large - a minus in my book.  I liked the size of nexus 5.  The battery lasts all day and then some.  My old phone, with extra long battery, was gone by end of day - another plus.  Overall, I like it a lot.
love the phone but its a bit big. but i knew that.
Great phone, fast and with all the google updates.
Good build quality; like the screen resolution... though not a Motorola fan, had a pretty bad experience with MotoRazor long long time back (around 12 - 13 years back) since then never used Motorola again, but this as my backup phone has helped to improve Motorola's image for me at least... there are friends who are big time fans of Motorola but somehow it failed to catch any fancy for me... hope using this for a long time will be good...
Great phone
Good price.

Unable too connect to At&t; LTE network.  It seems that this is more likely a manufacturer issue; particularly, the international version of the phone.  Too many At&T; users have issues connecting to the LTE band.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend this phone for heavy internet users because the phone only connects to the H+ band and that is pretty slow. The One +one is a better option.  Tried it and will be reverting to it.
Thank you so much for the brand new phone. And thanks for the quick delivery.<br/>Update: Two weeks later I'm happy I bought the phone. It is large for one hand, but I'm still happy I purchased it.
We ended up returning this phone, but not because of the phone itself, but because for whatever reason it was terrible on Verizon's network. And it's not a SIM card issue or anything.  We had no issues with our other phone, but put the SIM card in the Nexus 6 and the signal just was not as good. No clue why. We did all the usual updates, just didn't want to work well.  The phone itself was really nice.
Perfect except the back is already coming up
Good phone
I love it!

Yes it did

Fantastic!
It is good
Extremely nice phone. I thought it would take me a long time to get used to the size but I adjusted really quickly. Battery is pretty good but not as good as advertised. Its really dependent on your use. I am a relatively heavy user so it normally would last majorirty of the day for me. It has lasted the entire day for me in the past but its not the norm based on my usage
It is a Good product, but it is not having WIFI Calling. So i am disappointed. I do not know, why this version does not have WiFI calling. Other than that it is Goood.
Bought this phone a few days back for my wife,price was reasonable and i am posting a review after a day so as mentioned in the specification that the phone is big hence may take some time to get used to but apart from that its fast and camera is also good.battery lasted for almost a day once fully charged.<br/><br/>Amazon delivered it on time as usual.
Yes, for the week I used it. Ibarely tapped the corner of the phone and now it has a crack down the front of it. Very upset with how easy it was to crack the screen.
The phone is super cheap and super worth it.  I think the reason it's cheap is because the newer Nexus is coming out soon, but this phone is super responsive.  I also have a Galaxy S6, but I like this phone way better.  The S6 lags a little but this phone has no lag and updates are always coming to improve it.  It won't get outdated any time soon.

Seriously, what do you say, It's a work horse, Its a Nexus and made by Motorola. If you like your MotoX or MotoG,E you will like this phone. BIG screen, I often use this and my BLU Studio6 as mobile Tablet replacements. They are phones with built in data with screens that are large enought to use as tablets in a pinch. GREAT taveling device.
Well first off I was stupid and bought this when I have Verizon wireless and they don't support this phone unless you buy it from the store but I returned it and got it at the store and it's an amazing phone don't be intimated by the big screen you get used to it pretty quickly and it's fast! If you don't have Verizon get this phone!
I'm iffy about this phone. My phone is my office, and truthfully, its not like I work that much. So far, I'm not completely satisfied with the handling of the phone.<br/>First off, the phone gets super hot when in high usage. I have a cover and still it gets uncomfortably hot when gaming or streaming video. This is especially annoying when the phone rings and I have to put it to my ear and its blazing hot. I thought my device was defected, but then saw many other customers complain about the same thing so now I think it's just what this phone does.<br/>Second, I've had this phone a week now and its turned off 3 times on its own. I have to long press the power button to get it back, but then it takes forever to load up.<br/>Third, and this may be more of an Android issue, this "roller dex" window....does it have an end? It's like it doesn't have a limit of windows that can be open. I find myself having 30+ windows open at a time sometimes and the phone starts bugging out. It starts freezing, giving me error messages when loading a web pages, etc....so I have to continuously be on top of clearing and cleaning clutter in the phone. This is not too difficult in theory with all the amps.<br/><br/>Anyway, the point is, I thought I was getting a really great product at a bargain. Instead, I think either this phone is defective, or its not as powerful as I thought it'd be.<br/><br/>After a month, the feelings I reserve for this phone have not gotten any better.... This phone crashes constantly! Sometimes it works as advertised, other times I want to smash it against the wall.
This is one of two Nexus 6 phones I ordered.  It turns out the display is damaged on this phone (due to heat) and will need warranty coverage.  While the previous phones were covered under the cell phone company's universal coverage, warranty coverage here is a little more uncertain making this a cautionary buy.
Excelent
I love the OS of naked android and the screen is large and very vibrant. The speakers are loud and clear. This phone is a easy 5/5 but the camera crashing constatnly makes the camera unusable. Theu camera takes nice clear pictures but the crashing issue keeps it from being a perfect phone for me
NICE 6 inch screen. I wish the hardware was the same size as the Samsung Galaxy Mega though. It also needs an external MicroSD card slot. Enclosed battery (not sure how to change it out when it goes bad one day.) Other than that its a really nice phone. Its a "google iphone" basically.
Very beautiful phone, I love it!
I love my Nexus 6. I love the white back it just stands out way way more then the standard blue that everyone else gets from their carrier. Super fast, amazing screen (not so great in sunlight sadly), two day battery life for me (a medium user), and all the apps I need for both work and play.
Defective battery. I don't dare use the camera as using it would drain battery percent rapidly.<br/>Other than the battery being the reason as to why I want a refund or replacement.<br/>The phone itself is good looking but I was just an unlucky buyer that received a Nexus with defects.
The phone was ok, but after having premium smartphones, it lacked some of the niche features I was looking for, such as a fingerprint reader. And, the screen wasn't as good as my Note 4. I did enjoy the pure Android experience, but that even left some things to be desired.
A fully capable phone.  I like the idea of prompt Android updates.  The phone is bigger than I thought it would be... that's not terrible but I probably would have been happier with a screen that was just a bit smaller so it would be easier to get it into my pocket.
Awesome

my unit arrived  in great shape after charging it right away out of the box the temperature of the phone was too hot.  I turned it off  2 hours later while still off it was still hot a would not  turn on or if it did you receive a message  your device has malfunction with some Google error code and would turn off.<br/>returned the same day hassle free... I am sure maybe it was just mine. but I'll save that money till the new nexus phones come out in the coming months.
Great phone. My only complaint is that it's enormous. I think that 6" is too big for a phone, but I didn't pay close enough attention and missed that part of the description. My bad, so I can't dock a star.<br/><br/>Other than that, the phone is great.
Nexus 6 is the best Android cell phone I've ever used. "Pure Google" as they say. It's powerful, Lollipop 5.x, no bloat ware, and feels svelte in your hand. I like it. My only complaint is the cases available for it are very plastic-y.
Camera terrible......pink yello hue when dimmed...cant see phone well in sunlight...too pricey for too many minor problems...otherwise 6 inches is nice but really heavy awkward phone and since its curved it rotates on table will not lay flat
I receive the new nexus today. It looks good, but once I click the screen for action, the upper speaker generate a cracking. This noise is quite easy to notice, I can clearly hear it in the quite room. I am thinking return it.
Great!
Great.
I got this phone on Prime Day for $100 off! I only mention it because I probably would not have purchased it at the regular price. But I've loved Nexus devices for as long as they've been around and this one is no exception.
Really nice phone, fast processor, crystal clear screen. It is large to hold as a phone, but I'm ok with it. I found it useful to hang it on my belt when I'm working or sitting, and slip it into my pocket when I'm walking.
This is a great phone, though many of my friends and family tease me about its large size. Using the phone function can be unwieldily due to the size. However, it performs like a dream in all functionality. Love it!
First Nexus I bought that I didn't love. Didn't feel good in the hand. Didn't like the material. Not really white. More like a dull grey. Returned it. Good think Google coming out with 2 new phones later this year.
For all those who complain that the size is too big, for me it fits comfortable in my hands. Love the keyboard and how fast it is. It takes a little time to get used to the size. But believe me, it's just right.
I'm having issues with the nexus. I transferred all my data from my Samsung.<br/>The screen freeze and the front speakers are not clear or loud when i place calls on speaker.<br/>Overall its a ok phone.
Overall review. $199.99 and BATTERY life made the deal for me on this phone. PLUS Big 6inch screen that I try to use with one hand, my thumb is getting exercise & getting longer each day. AMAZING PHONE.
Have had the phone since July 2015 and my fully charged battery does not even last 3 hours now.  A hairline crack on the screen has appeared although the phone is protected and I have not had a drop.
I helped a friend buy
I have had this phone for 6 months and it has been a let down from the start. The battery life is awful. At one point Google had fixed this issue with a 5.1.1 update, but the next round of updates undid the good work. I have to charge this phone twice daily if I want to have a working phone all day.  The camera is very much sub par. The phone runs hot. The screen is just ok for a qhd screen. It isn't anything spectacular.<br/><br/>I have never owned and iPhone, and probably never will, so don't think of me as some iPhan-boi. I just do not like this phone. Too many issues to over come.<br/><br/>I would not buy this phone again. Get a LG G3 or G4. Just not this fail of a device. 2 stars instead of 1 because it has gotten my through 6 months...
Most excellent phone
good.
good!
Oh my goodness I love it sooooo much! I am an avid Android lover, and actually came from my nexus 5, it is such a great phone, big, but I love it!!!! Don't regret this purchase at all!
I love this phone. It is replacing my LG Optimus Pro and I wanted a phablet that is reasonably priced. Only miss is the lack of a silent feature but vibration is not a big deal for me
Phone stopped receiving and sending data. No fix. I've tried everything. I basically spent $350 to own this phone for 2 weeks. If the data worked I would give this phone 5 stars.
Spins and spins. Doesn't lay flat, so don't expect to do any gesture typing while it sits on your desk. Otherwise, this is a great phone. I'm using it with Google Fi service.
This is a good phone, costs way less than an iPhone 6 Plus and worth the price because it has a 20% larger display and 2x more storage than the iPhone 6 Plus. Comes in good shipping and handling. Processor is twice as fast as iPhone 6 Plus, which is 1.4GHz, and the Nexus 6 is 2.7GHz. Has 3GB RAM, which is good for multitasking, and is 3x faster at multitasking than the iPhone 6 Plus, which is 1GB RAM. Nexus 6 has a 13MP rear camera and 2MP front camera, but the iPhone 6 Plus has an 8MP back camera and a 1.2MP front camera. Nexus 6  rear camera also features OIS, optical image stabilization, for focused and steady videos. Also, rear camera features 4K videos.
I loved the Nexus 5 except for one problem, its battery life was crappy. The Nexus 6 completely solves this problem! I intend to keep it until I am forced to upgrade.
After Nexus One, Nexus S and Droid Maxx (also known as Motorola XT1080M), I chose Nexus 6 as my 4th android smart phone, of course it didn't make me disappointed.
Good phone. HUGE!
Love this phone. I wasn't sure about the size at first. It seemed very big. But i got use to it.. The shipping was fast and phone was in very good condition.
Phone is very Good . if you are ok with its huge size . Also I observed its get warmed up during charging and also in normal use like watching you tube etc
Build quality is poor. Battery cover separates from the body. I returned for a replacement and have same problem with the other right out of the box.

This is fantastic! I am so happy with my purchase. Not only the price is almost unbeatable, the product itself is really AWESOME! Nexus 6 rocks!!
i have an N6 and bought this was a backup.<br/>i'd like it to be bigger.<br/>would prefer if i was a third wider, say 4" x 6".
so far so good, It is a bit large, used to the nexus 5, I do miss the smaller size at times, but I'm sure I will get used to it.
Thus far, I'm very satisfied with the nexus 6, sorry I did not know of the newest release before hand, I would have waited.
Great phone. I've had it now for about 8 months. I like the features and the size.<br/><br/>Here are the issues:<br/>1. Up close pictures/selfies in darker lights turn out green most of the time.<br/>2. The keyboard randomly stops working and I can suddenly not type.<br/>3. When the phone gets the slightest warmth to it, it stops working.<br/>4. The charge doesn't last very long.<br/>5. I feel it might give out before my contract is up, or right after.
Great deal on this.<br/>Dumped lousy Sprint and got on Project Fi.<br/>Saving a lot of money, better service.
While there is no way I would pay double retail to buy a phone from the original manufacturer, I've had this phone for about three weeks now and love it.<br/><br/>My only complaint is the lack of customization on battery saver features. The fact that it gives you no choice on disabling background data makes the feature and all or nothing kind of thing. I do miss the flexibility battery saver gave me in TouchWiz.
Yes
Works better then my old note 3, and doesn't have all of Samsung/Verizon bloatware that you can't turn off.
Good phone but just 3 stars. The start button quite sensitive. And sometimes it crashes and gets restarted
Excelent, is a huge phone but very confortable, nice screen and fast. Recomendations use with protector!!
Super good Black Friday deal for $199.99
Exactly what I expect. Great cell phone.
At 349$ for the 32 gb, its a steal. Early Android updates and the always on feature from the moto X!
I loved my Nexus 5 and this phone is just a bigger and better version of that. Very happy with it.
Best phone
I returned the product. It came in bad condition. Phone was dirty and had a couple of scratches.
I received the product without problems. The cell is excellent, works better than I expected .
Moved from an iPhone 4S which I used for almost 4 years. Hopefully this lasts just as long.
Still under testing.Though the phone charger is not working....disappointed from amazon.
Received an opened box, not sure if this was a refurbished item, but the description does specify new.<br/>The plastic cover did not stick very well and was dirty.  The SIM tool was loose in the box.<br/>The phone works well, I was surprised to see that the notification led is not working, most likely an Android 6 issue.
This phone feels great in the hand, looks great, and has a productive operating system.
It is the international version XT1100, great device from a good seller.<br/>Thank you
Keeps offering an update but never updates when accepted.  Otherwise pretty cool.
Amazing phone but why dosent it download to new 6.0 marshmallow. It's November 27
Excelent
Very good product, very satisfied, is the price of other places is much lower
A Google phone (or phablet) of 2014. The only pity is a missing aarch64 cpu.
a phone that is beautiful, good, cheap, and with the quality of Motorola.
Great phone, you get used to the size and the screen real estate is nice.
Awesome phone, battery life definitely lacking. Dead by 5-7pm every day.
A+
OK
Great phone but the phones speaker for talk stopped working so one star
This is the best phone I've ever owned.  I was worried about the huge size but quickly have gotten used to it and now anything smaller is unacceptable.  Battery life started out lasting a day, but just barely.  Now, several weeks into owning it, I get almost 2 days use with it!  Lollipop is a great OS and having vanilla Android is the best.
Great flagship nexus from Google in 2014. And amazing price by Amazon!
Terrible quality..plastic is chipping off and fallig all over my house
awesome
not bad
One package was already opened.One was fine.Not satisfied with all
Big screen and fast, but camera is not as good. IP6, SSG is better
A great product, it's the same that appears in the image.
Big phone, no one-hand operation available. Great screen.
I ask for 2 phones, everything was OK ,but one of them has now a broken pixel (in the 2nd week) and it does not cast video through my Chrome-cast I don't know why, my other phones does that just OK...
Love this phone. The best Phablet out there hands down.
Went to Verizon and 5 minutes later had it all set up.
Its a great phone i love it, the service was great :)
Nice phone, pretty fast compared to my earlier phone
A review for the system and not the stupid scalpers
Great Phone!!!<br/>Ineed the North America version of nexus 6,will this phone be shipped to India? And will this device work in the North America and in other countries as well??
Great
Late to the game here but couldn't pass up the sale price even with the announcement of the new Nexus 6 and Nexus 5s around the corner. Coming from a Nexus 4 experience, I was happy with that device and comfortable with Android 5.1.1 so transition is a breeze. I love the fact that I could transfer all my apps and many settings, etc immediatley via NFC.<br/><br/>The phone itself is elegant. I'd heard much about the sheer girth of the device but I guess as a person who can palm a basketball, the in-hand feel here isn't off putting.<br/><br/>Performance has been snappy. I guess the biggest difference I can see between this and the 4 is how quickly downloads, updates and switching between apps is handled. On the 4 I could have several apps running but eventually I'd run into some super slow speed. I've not reached that threshold yet on the 6.<br/><br/>Why 4 stars rather than 5? As much as I like this camera, especially in comparison to the 4's very basic camera, it is slow. Slow focus, slow everything. If I have to take a quick shot I can imagine missing the opportunity.<br/><br/>Space. Listen, for years I said that my hard drive space isn't important because I always store to the cloud. 8 gigs was enough. But in the end it became limiting when unwanted to play around with new apps or listen to podcasts that aren't offered on my preferred streaming options like Stitcher and SoundCloud. Since frabbing this 32 gig model, Ive since added about 20 very useful apps that I just didn't have space for on the 4.<br/><br/>Why did I skip the 5? Honestly? I was happy with the 4. A new phone would've been cool, novel. But I honestly wasn't interested. So what prompted me to move other than the steal of a price point at $349 here on Amazon? Again, the 4 is starting to experience some weird events and timing out on specific apps. It isnt constant but the intermittent issues are annoying. That plus the ability to use Google's Project Fi made making a change attractive. I still use the 4, BTW. Since Project Fi is new and I want to test drive it for a while I'm keeping both.<br/><br/>This is a great buy though. I'm only a week in but I'm in love with it.
PROS:<br/><br/>1. Android 5.1.1<br/>2. Awesome screen and photos (if the camera app works)<br/>3. Good sound quality.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>1. Phone getting really really warm/ hot even with normal use. Yes, I am talking about no video streaming, no GPS navigation and any such heavy CPU/GPU/memory intensive applications.<br/><br/>2. Battery life : The battery drains really fast. I have switched from an iPhone and is used to long battery life. This phone, I have to charge multiple times a day to get it going.<br/><br/>3. Camera lag : The background photo processing takes for ever. Sometimes, it takes up to 5 to 10 seconds for the camera app to come up.
very very nice.  We love the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6.
There few problems with touch screen being buggy
I thought I would get this phone because it looks premium and has good hardware specs, but the execution is flawed. Do a google search and you'll see hundreds to thousands of posts about the top speaker problems and call quality issues on this phone. My phone started showing these symptoms just 30 days after I bought it.. should have bought an iPhone 5s (last phone was nexus 4- this one is plagued with issues).<br/><br/>And if anyone says I was sent a defective unit... then apparently I paid full price for a defective unit and the situation has not been rectified.
Like it,but the hotspot makes the heat so high
Just an awesome Stock Android phone, love it.
Absolutely loving this phone. Great device!!
Using it with Google Project Fi.  Very, very happy!
it is A good Phone for 399.99 even though new nexus 6P is released.I think motorola is better than Huawei.
Great phone. Highly recommend.
The  phone is ok. I love it ;)
Charge port is slightly off of center.  Makes plugging in charger slightly harder than it should be.
This is phone is  Really good
Great machine. Better price.
Excellent and honest sellers
Fast shipping, great phone
Actually a great tablet...
Best phone I've ever had.
An amazing device overall. Although the price is a bit high compared to past Nexus devices, it is worth every cent. If you are able to, don't wait! Buy this phone now!
Nice and goooood
Very solid phone
I did not purchase from Amazon but I bought one from T-Mobile..<br/>The pros:<br/>Fast & smooth (just like all new flagship phones)<br/>Beautiful screen<br/>Great camera<br/>Good battery life and charges fast.<br/>Makes watching YouTube and playing games a pleasurable experience compared to using something smaller<br/><br/>Con's: this phone is way too damn big! I ended up returning it.<br/>Pressing the "back" button was too hard to do with one hand which is the main reason I didn't keep the phone. Maybe if it was a little cheaper I could of delt with it but probably not..<br/>The other con I think was I didn't get the fast LTE speeds in San Jose, CA that I did with the Nexus 5 but that's probably a carrier problem. Idk... Anyways I went with the droid turbo from Verizon and put it on my T-Mobile account. (Similar size to the N5) but..... I can't root it and think I wasted money and sometimes the LTE connection sucks. I should if waited for the LG G4 to be released or something.<br/>Anyways, if you already have a flagship from this year or late 2013, I'd say you'd not be losing anything by waiting for something else..but if your phone broke or just want to stay with the latest tech this is a great phone. As long as you have a hand that fits in size L or XL gloves.....
Fantastic phone
Nice cellphone!
it's very good.
wonderfullllll
I have tried it twice and yet both times it failed my expectations. The manufacturing QC is poor for this device. The first one I had had a faulty touch screen and the second I had, the sim tray didn't sit flush in the device.<br/><br/>Stock android is great, the front facing speakers are great, and so is everything else but the front facing camera. Size is big yes but it's a phablet. Motorola needs to invest more into the build quality of each device.
I purchased the white 32 G from Motorola site. I don't really like the blue one.  Initially felt really big in hand but after 2-3 days it felt really comfortable.  It fits better in my back pocket since the large size keep the phone up and won't be crushed when sitting down.  I just ordered a 64G white one from Amazon at a good price but it won't be delivered till Feb.
Phone is awesome, but the reason for the 4 stars is that there is no wi-fi calling... which is a feature that is available if purchased thru TMobile. Where we live it's almost essential, so not having that feature meant a lot to us. If that's not important, it's a wonderful phone. Screen is crystal clear and the calls are a lot crisper than the Nexus 5. Great phone, just missing one key feature for us.
Size too big
Jellybean!!!
Great phone!
works great!
Great phone.
After having several Android devices (Nexus 4-5, HTC M7, Oneplus One, Motorola X 2013), I found the Nexus 6 to be quiet boring and it stutters a lot with Lollipop running at 5.1.1 version. Even with the beast guts it feels laggy compared to other devices.<br/><br/>I would go back to my Oneplus one or get a Sony Z3 or Moto X2014 and save up the difference.
Product advertised as usable on Verizon network.<br/><br/>Nope. I did a 2 hour run around ending without access.<br/><br/>Since I bought this on black friday ($200 = GREAT DEAL), I can return the product... But I can't get the SAME EXACT PHONE from BEST BUY --- Which is locked --- But would be active on the Verizon network....<br/>Derp.
I just bought this one 28 days ago. Today i realized that i have dead pixels. That pixel is always red and never changes its color. Its so small but im afraid that it may increase and capture the entire screen or getting bigger dy bay day. Im so sad about it. I really really liked this phone and i almost got used. Im sending it back today...
I like it
very good
I like it
This review is about the Nexus 6 phone but as a side comment, you would be crazy to pay more than retail price for it - seriously, $999?!<br/><br/>The good - large display, amazingly fast processor, good dual front facing speakers and Lollipop is a huge improvement, looks beautiful and is so much more productive, intuitive and nice to look at.<br/><br/>The bad - large and clunky (which may be a positive for you, but it was too large for my hands and not comfortable even two-handed), the OS is not optimized to use the larger screen so no dual pane email or other tablet like features that would come in handy on such a large screen. For such a high pixel density screen, I was underwhelmed. The color temperature is very, very yellowish and screen brightness lags almost every other flagship phone, whether Android or iPhone. The colors were oddly saturated as well, even beyond what you would normally see in an AMOLED screen.<br/><br/>I'm not an iPhone fanboy, having owned and loved, the Nexus 4, Nexus 3, and even Windows Phones, but the iPhone 6, 6+ for me, is a far better device since the screen brightness is miles above the N6 and the color temperature is crisp and white. Compare the two side by side using the web browsers and you'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>The iPhone fit and finish is much better and the aluminum body feels much higher quality although the N6 isn't bad, it just isn't worth the price. If the N6 were still priced as competitively as the N5 was, I probably would have kept it, but paying premium prices, I expect an all around premium phone and for me, this wasn't it so I returned mine yesterday.
Initially, I could not be happier!<br/>I've had this phone for 1 week now. I came from Samsung GS-III. Sooo nice to have this Upgraded, unlocked and and soon to be Project Fi phone.<br/>And, thanks Amazon for the Solid you did for me.<br/>Very Happy Amazon Prime Customer
Awasome!
Amazing.
I got a faulty phone that did not work. As I first turned it on, it kept freezing, couldn't find activate the Wifi or anything. Once I got past that, it just kept rebooting indefinitely until it ran out of battery. What a waste. Seemed like a fine phone.
<br/><br/>
Device received is defective out of the box.  Device keep crashing with message, "Unfortunately Google App has stopped." even I hit OK over 20 times message with continue to pop up. I am Very disappointed with this item.
awesome
All ok!
awesome
Perfect
It's good but it has one issue<br/><br/> - It's too sensitive,in my case, it dropped down from my bed on a carpet, the screen backlight just turned off even if the falling distance was very small!
It's just perfect
Value for money!
Terrible phone. Returned same day I got it.  It had a corrupted file and wouldn't update to 5.1.1. It also would randomly reboot, but only while texting. I'm going back to LG.
Google Fi - Caution!  If you're buying this phone to use with Google Fi, it won't work with Fi.  It has the "wrong build number", according to the Google helpdesk.  I just spent an hour with them.  They've sent me instructions for how to flash the phone to try to get it to work, but simultaneously don't recommend doing so.  I'm going to attempt it, but there are no guarantees.  There's nothing wrong with the phone I received, per se--it just doesn't work for the reason I bought it.
I am a heavy phone user. I had to charge this phone 3 times a day.  It was also big and heavy. I'm using a note edge now, which feels much lighter and holds a charge all day
I've owned several of this model.  It's a good phone, good camera, but the screen breaks way too easily.  I've owned a few and I've never had a screen crack from drops so easily.  My best friend and I have both owned several.  I hope the newer models are more durable because this might be the least durable phone I've ever owned.  Only reason I kept going back to it was because it's one of the only phones on the Verizon network that is easy to unlock and root.
super
was not the correct phone for usa, as advertised.<br/>HOWEVER<br/>they return without much fighting, when i explained it was open box to begin with!
Buggy software, random rebooting, constantly dropping signal. Going back to Amazon.
good
I am having the same problem my nexus 6 back cover is peeling off under the power, volume buttons.<br/>That is really bad.
DON'T BUY IF YOUR PURPOSE IS TO GET UPDATES AS SOON AS GOOGLE RELEASES THEM. This phone gets locked to AT&T; as soon as you slide an AT&T; sim. This means you won't get android updates from Google but from AT&T;, which will arrive 6 months later . I bought it because I didn't want to wait for OS updates, but this defeats the whole purpose.
I had the Nexus 5 for over a year and it was the best smartphone I've ever had. Fast, pure Android-driven and my only complain was the camera that didn't work too well at night. I was anxious to get my hands on the following Nexus 6, but couldn't find anywhere other Amazon or Google Play Store itself. When it finally arrived, I was surprised by it's huge size and the fact that is actually a phablet, not a phone. Too big to carry on your pocket and too big to type with one hand only. Despite all the upgrades from Nexus 5 (which are really good), it's size really bothers me and after 1 month using it I still regret it. Specially if you consider that it's price is comparable to other fantastic Android phones out there that still fit in your hands and pockets. If you are looking for a Nexus 6, I highly recommend you go to the nearest store and see it for yourself first.
Nice phone
main camera did not work out of the box. random restarts. first time on amazon i am reviewing an item negatively.
It does not have a good reception. I used with it straighttalk on ATT, it was barely usable. I had to return it.
The phone came defective with a broken speaker. Many others are having this issue, and motorola will not even acknowledge it, to avoid profit loss I'm getting. The speaker starts at high volume and decreases within 3 seconds to about 40%, everytime, and after hours and hours of searching for solutions online, the only thing I found was people saying they had to send their phone back and get a new one. I can't not have a phone for a few days, due to my work. Definitely the last motorola phone I'll ever buy. DO NOT BUY.
The phone is exactly the same I`ve waited for. And it`s an international version, model XT1100.
Ecxelent
Update 4:  WiFi, Email (Gmail) bugs<br/>This may have to do with the recent update, but the phone now occasionally "forgets" my home WiFi network, requiring it to re-acquire the WiFi network and for me to re-enter the password.  Also, it will occasionally change my email Outgoing Server Settings, causing my inboxes not to sync and for emails from the phone to not be sent.  This on a business phone?  Garbage.  Again, never had this happen on BB's or even the Galaxy's I had.<br/><br/>Reception has improved thankfully.<br/><br/>Update 3:  Do not crack this screen<br/>Apparently, it is fairly common (according to the phone repair shop I've had to bring my Nexus 6 to) for the screen to stop working entirely if the glass cracks.  Unlike previous phones I've seen with cracked screen (various co-workers' iPhones and Galaxy S4/S5's, wife's S3) where a cracked screen still functions as normal, cracking the screen on a Nexus 6 will often result in the screen not functioning at all even though the phone itself still works.<br/><br/>Also according to the phone repair shop, there are apparently at least two different models of this phone circulating and depending on which you have, the cost of the replacement screen differs dramatically.  The lower cost one is about $170, the more expensive is a ridiculous $400 (neither include labor).<br/><br/>Update 2:  reprogrammed antennas.  So awesome that I have FULL 3G BARS now in downtown Arlington Heights!  (See uploaded photo).  Who needs 4G LTE right?<br/><br/>60 Day Updated Review: 6/13<br/>TL;DR - Noticeable lag, Increasingly Hit/Miss "Ok Google" Performance, Reception still absolutely horrendous<br/><br/>"Unacceptable" would be the key word I'd use to describe the Nexus 6 at this point.  Some performance issues that I've experienced in the 30 days since initial review have made me realize that this phone isn't as good as I originally had thought, so I've dropped the rating.  If the issues I experienced were in some auxiliary/non-critical aspects of the phone, I may have just made some remarks and kept the original rating.  However, the issues are relating to the absolute core functions of the phone - performance and reception - and IMO have rendered the phone a very poor tool for my use.  One star is harsh and I think it is rare that honest, level-headed reviewers give a product a one-star review ("Why'd you buy it in the first place?") but this is one of those cases where the luster has worn off and the product underneath is clearly not worth the price tag.<br/><br/>Those performance issues as follows:<br/>1.  Lag:  The only apps I've downloaded since the initial review (and the initial purchase of the phone) have been Line, Skype, FB and Messenger, LinkedIn, Chase Mobile, TuneIn Radio and UPS Mobile.  So I'm not sure if its something about one or more of these apps, or just me getting used to the phone's performance speed, but I feel like things have slowed down.  Some examples:<br/>  a.  Responsiveness to touch and swipe motions:  noticeable lag here, sometimes half a second or so.  This includes swiping between<br/>  home screens, registering a click on the menu button, and swiping "away" apps to close them.<br/>  b.  Lag in closing or switching windows:  the swipe registers, but the screen "hangs" for a split second before closing or moving,<br/>  regardless of what app is being worked.  Good example is swiping back to the main home screen from the "Google Now" page, as it<br/>  will move a little bit, freeze for a split second, then go back to the home screen.<br/>  c.  Phone Dialer:  I have maybe 300 contacts stored.  Any action related to the phone or address book is unacceptably slow.  This<br/>  includes opening the phone dialer, swiping between sub-menus in the phone dialer screen, scrolling through call history, speed<br/>  dialing contacts, etc - it literally feels like I'm doing it on my old Moto Atrix, that is how slow everything here is.  I almost believe that<br/>  this is a defect in the phone software as that is how glaring the issue is.  The phone dialer opens so slowly that sometimes I don't<br/>  think that the click registered, so I click again on the phone icon, but the phone ends up speed dialing a number - What is<br/>  happening?  The click actually does register, but the screen response is so laggy that the next screen (the Speed Dial screen) does<br/>  not show up until well after I've clicked again, so my second click actually registers on whatever name is in that location on the<br/>  screen when the Speed Dial screen does pop up.  HUGELY annoying/frustrating, and frankly unacceptable on a $600 phone.<br/><br/>2.  Hit or Miss "Ok Google" performance:  the feature that sold me on this phone over the Galaxy S6 is getting pretty spotty now.  Not sure what's changed.  Although I did learn that intonation plays a role in how the phone registers the "Ok Google" command.  Not sure how to explain the intonation in writing, but (on my phone at least) you have to say it more as a command than as a request.  So it sounds like "OH-KAY, goo-GLE" instead of "oh-KAY~, GOO-gle~".  But even when I say it "correctly", there are times when the command simply doesn't work, or it works but the confirmation tone (which sounds letting you know  that Google is awaiting your command) doesn't ring.  And MANY times now, even if it registers "Ok, Google", the following command takes a very long time to get recognized.  All this makes the function pretty much useless the way I need it - driving in the car, and having the phone take down a note or make a phone call without me every touching the phone.<br/><br/>3.  Reception:  No OTA firmware update as of  yet, so I'll say it's official:  all reception (WiFi, voice, LTE) on this phone is absolute dogsh*t.  No way around it, at least not in Chicago.  And since having the phone, I've traveled as far north as Racine, WI, as far south as Peoria, IL, as far east as Lafayette, IN and west as Rockford, IL.  In all these cities and all points between, voice and LTE/data consistently hovered between half and no signal.  It became such an issue that I take particular note of where and when the bars are anywhere near close, or above  half.  This happens RARELY.  As I look at my phone now, sitting at my desk in Northwest Suburbs where Verizon should be King of Service, I'm at half-bars on voice and 3/4 Wifi (I'm about 20ft from my wireless router).<br/><br/>Relating to my original review:<br/>1.  Stability - the phone has yet to crash, explode or melt down but calling it "stable" might be pushing it.  The lag I'm experience on this Nexus 6 is precisely what drove me away from the Galaxy line-up.  For it to be present 60 days in is alarming to say the least.  So if my original impression of the phone's stability was a 9, I'd say its a 5 at this point.<br/>2.  Ease of Use - The lag and "Ok, Google" issues sink the phone here.  I don't ask for much of my phones, as you can tell by the very few apps I download and the limited ways in which I use my phone.  But for the few core functions that I need, it better handle them well.  I will mention here that GMail as your combined email management system is a bad, bad idea.  The interface on 5.0 is not as user friendly as previous Android OS's, and sometimes downright frustrating especially when you have a longish email thread going (displaying the original email at the top and forcing you to scroll to the bottom for the most recent, using big colored circles with letters and numbers in them to signify... who knows what?  Serious headscratcher here for the Android folks).<br/>3.  Battery:  still micro-managing my power usage, performance still so-so.<br/>4.  Call Quality:  Still too low, no way around it.<br/>5.  Reception:  As noted above, unacceptably bad.<br/><br/>So yeah - a phone that cannot receive and place calls reliably is.  Get the S6.  Get a Droid X.  Get an Xperia.  Heck, get a flip phone.  Do not get the Nexus 6.<br/><br/>ORIGINAL REVIEW:  5/14<br/>I've been using my Nexus 6 on Verizon (NW Suburbs of Chicago) for about a month now, enough time to have really dug into it and get past the novelty phase.  To put my review and impressions in perspective, some background on what phones I've used and my main purpose with the phones other than making phone calls.<br/><br/>1.  Prior to the Nexus 6, I had a Galaxy S6 (very briefly), Galaxy S4 for 2 years, S3 for 2 years, and Atrix for 2 years.  Prior to those, Blackberries.<br/><br/>2.  Other than phone calls, these are the key things I used my phone for in descending order of importance:<br/>a. Accessing, reading and replying to Emails remotely.  This includes corporate emails via Outlook (up until recently, yay), Hotmail, Gmail and webmail portals.<br/>b.  Organizer for events (reminders, calendars, notes), and contacts.<br/>c.  Google Maps and Navigation on the road.<br/>d.  Listening to stored and streaming music<br/><br/>3.  Given the above requirements, these were the things I looked for:<br/>a.  System stability has always been my number one prerequisite for my phones. Blackberries spoiled me.  The jump to Samsungs opened my eyes to how easily and quickly smartphones can become unstable.  As long as I knew that I could depend on an app or file could be opened whenever I needed it, I could deal with pretty much anything else.<br/>b.  It had to be easy for me to quickly access whatever apps it was that I used frequently.  Easy integration with Outlook Exchange servers, easy to read calendar, easy to enter contacts, easy to share files between the phone and other devices (home PC, bluetooth headset/head unit), familiar MS Office-like apps.<br/>c.  Very good battery life, and ways to easily extend usage times.<br/><br/>**Note** Here are things that I frankly could not care less about on a phone:<br/>1.  Camera quality<br/>2.  Facebook/Twitter/Google+ integration<br/>3.  Streaming Netflix<br/>4.  Screen quality<br/>5.  Size<br/><br/>With the above, I decided on the Nexus 6 after shopping the Galaxy Note 4, Galaxy S6, and Droid Turbo.  Against, my target criteria, here is how I made my decisions and how the Nexus 6 has fared so far:<br/><br/>1.  System Stability (Good):  Pure Android implies a higher degree of stability throughout the life of the device so the Nexus 6 had a headstart here.  I keep all my devices very "light" and make a conscious decision to minimize the number of apps that are running or even downloaded on the phone.  Obviously Touchwiz adds someweight to the Note and S6, but I only spent hands-on time with the S6 and it was a nightmare.  I won't go into detail here, but I had the phone for a total of about 24 hours and without downloading anything, here are the things that went wrong in 1 day:<br/>a.  Found out that Samsung (likely) removed the ability for "Ok, Google" to be used from any screen other than the home screen, unlocked.<br/>b.  At some point during the night, "Ok, Google' functionality completely disappeared from my home screen.  I am tech savvy, and know my way around Reddit and XDA developer forums, and tried all trouble-shooting short of a hard factory reset.  No go, still a mystery to me to this day.<br/>c.  Battery life was HORRENDOUS.  I keep BT off except in the car, and had WiFi on at honme.  Again no apps downloaded, so straight out of the box the battery drained from about full  when I activated the phone at around 4:30pm to the 5 minute warning before I went to bed.<br/>d.  Perceived Speed:  this is subjective, but I found the S6 no faster or slower than my wife's S5 or my recently traded in S4 or  for that matter.  I fiddled with Google Earth zooming in and out and scanning around, I perceived no difference in how quickly my wife's S5 and the S6 rendered maps.  It made me concerned about how Touchwiz and the S6 would hold up over 2 years, and based on my experience with the other three Galaxies I decided not to take the risk.<br/><br/>2.  Ease of Use (Great):  Its taken me some time to get used to stock Lollipop interface but its fairly easy to use.  Touchwiz was always relatively easy for me to use also though.<br/>a.  Emails were a breeze to set up on the Nexus 6, but also easy to set up on the Galaxies.<br/>b.  I think the biggest difference in the Ease of Use category is the huge Google Voice issue I had with the S6.  This was the main deal-breaker for me.  With the Nexus 6, I can say "Ok, Google", then "Take a Note" or "Set a Reminder".  I cannot count how many times a day I use this, and with the Google Keeper app (that you can also get with the S6), this thing is a scheduler/reminder/organizer God-send for me.  If the S6 could have resolved its Google Voice issue, I might not be with the Nexus 6.  Unsure of whether or not the Droid Turbo was afflicted with the same issue, but I'm 99% sure based on my reading that any Samsung with Lollipop would get global Google Voice recognition stripped so the Note 4 was out too.<br/>c.  The non-removable/upgradable storage is an issue for and I highly dislike this in both the Nexus 6 and the S6.  Transferring files via the USB link is slower than being able to plug in a micro-SD directly into the PC.<br/>d.  Bluetooth seemed to have been much improved with the Nexus6 and S6 over my old S4.  The Nexus 6 pairs quickly and easily with my car's head unit, no complaints here.<br/><br/>3.  Battery life (So-So): has been OK, but not great.  Already said my bit on the S6.  Quickcharge is a nice feature and definitely works on both phones though.  Best battery life I've experienced so far on any of my phones was the S4, and that had the ability obviously to swap out batteries if needed.  The Nexus 6 is pretty picky with the Qi wireless charging, I don't see it as any more than a gimmick.  If battery life had been a top priority, I'd be using the Droid Turbo right now.<br/><br/>4.  Call Quality (Terrible):  Surprised other reviewers have left this out of their reviews but I have seen this issue called out elsewhere.  The volume is terrible on this phone, specifically how high it can go.  Here is a good example to demonstrate:  To hear a colleague of mine while I sat in my living room with no other ambient noise, I had to not only put him on speakerphone with the volume at the loudest setting but I had to hold the phone a few inches from my ear.  I am not hard of hearing, I don't blast music through headphones and I don't do anything else that might have damaged my hearing.  The phone simply has an extremely low max volume through the speakers and even through the headset.  This is nearly a deal-breaker for me and with this I can't give the phone any more than 3 stars.  The issue is so severe that it is almost enough to offset the productivity uplift of "Ok Google".  Its a phone for crying out loud - at least handle calls well.  Never had issues like this with loudness on any other phone.  I'm certain that literally ANY other phone I might have gotten would have better loudness control than this thing.<br/><br/>5.  Reception (Bad):  In the Chicago-land area, Verizon is widely regarded as the carrier with the best coverage.  Indeed, never had many issues getting reception with any other phone except if you really go into the sticks.  With the Nexus 6, data speeds drop off badly a lot of times.  This appears to be a known issue with these phones though and I hope it gets resolved through an OTA update soon.  The S6 had no such issues, and neither did any of the other Galaxies I had.<br/><br/>For all the things I need my phone to do and all the other things that I don't really care about, the Nexus 6 appears to be the best choice for me.  So far, its held up well, performs consistently day in and day out, and the large screen size has come in handy quite a few times.  I've never found the camera lacking in any way the few times I've had to use it, the native Google apps are useful and unlike any other phones I've gotten, I didn't have to delete ANY bloatware from the phone - I just started using it.  "OK Google" really is the killer app for me though, because I often use it in the textbook scenario where I'm driving, phone is in my bag, and I realize that I need to do something important so I say "Ok Google", and if its quiet enough I can rattle off a reminder or schedule something without ever taking my eyes off the road.
The phone is excellent. Huge screen. Great battery life. Pure Android experience.
Actually it was greet<br/>But until now I face problem with battery it's so week
As a reviewer I want to say that this device is really very cool and impressive. A 6 inch display is really good. Great built quality. Nexus series is not so good in their cameras but this device solve this problem. Camera quality is really very impressive but not so good in low light as I expected. One thing is also noticeable that the battery I'd not so good. It only start with you for a day than you have to charge it to use further. According to me don't go for this device because at this price range you can get more impressive devices.<br/>Thank you!!!
I received phone not brand new,There are a lot of fingerprints on the back
POSITIVE:<br/>* Works well on Verizon.  The nano SIM from my Verizon iPhone 6 works perfectly with this Nexus 6.  I have the XT1103 version purchased from Amazon.  The product description incorrectly states that it doesn't work on Verizon.<br/>* GPS navigation works well using Nokia HERE maps while offline (on airplane mode while location services is on).<br/>* Quick charger works well and is fast.<br/>* Vanilla Android.<br/><br/>NEGATIVE:<br/>* Curved back is comfortable for holding with one hand, but it makes it less stable in car phone carriers.<br/>* Battery life is short.  Good thing the quick charger works well.  You should also get a good vehicle quick charger (e.g., Anker PowerDrive+ 1).<br/>* Android is still not as smooth functioning as iOS. This is not Nexus 6 specific, but it's still worth noting.
Excellent mobile but it's little big, accepted
Got the phone on sale, couldn't be happier.
Too bad the price is a bit expensive.
The Nexus 6 is the new successor to Google's very own Nexus 5 from last year. This phone aims to be bigger and better than the already awesome Nexus 5. This time Motorola has decided to give it a shot to make this pure android experience so let's see if this year they nailed Google's new flagship phone.<br/>________<br/><br/>Design: The Nexus 6 is BIG. When I say big, I mean really big. The only phone that comes close to being the size of this phone is the iphone 6 plus. This phone is almost the borderline of what determines the difference between a phone and a tablet. Motorola is really stretching the size with this phone. The phone is a lot more rounded and curvaceous from last years model but I feel like it was made this way to make gripping such a big phone a lot easier. I do like the design of the device especially the metal bezels which give it a premium feel. The keys are not mushy and give a good tactile feedback.<br/>________<br/><br/>Sound: The phone utilizes stereo front facing speakers which ma... Read more
This phone is a huge disappointment. While I do love the build of this phone, stock lollipop, storage size, and speakers, the screen and the camera on this phone is just terrible. Viewing angles are terrible, changing colors and rainbowing out with little movement, and the camera is grainy and terrible even in good lighting. Battery life is also not that great...<br/><br/>It's an average phone, one that I am not too happy with.
Overheating is the main drawback
Just an fyi to all potential buyers, there is a known reboot issue that has not been addressed by Google w.r.t this product. And its not isolated to a carrier; in fact thousands of people are facing the issue. Here are two of the forums where you can explore this further:<br/><br/>  - http://forums.androidcentral.com/google-nexus-6/466230-google-nexus-6-random-reboots.html<br/>  - https://productforums.google.com/forum/m/#!topic/nexus/9aVUBrwdUZU<br/><br/>And it is unrelated to apps as many might suggest. The OS should be able to handle stray memory leaks/process anrs automatically and should **never** reboot. Its really quite inexcusable.
The phone should have been my favorite phone of the year if it does not have some problems from the top speaker.<br/><br/>I have done like 4 replacements, either it is on google store or amazon, all of them have the same issue. The top speaker makes some crackling/popping sound every time i touch the screen (i already disable the touching sound). Then i realize that all the phone was defective and many people have the same problem like me, it is just that you guys dont really care about it or havent noticed it yet.<br/><br/>2 stars since i still like it, but the problem annoys me more than that.
Nice price nice phone
What is not to love.
Excelent porduct!
Very weak battery
Don't know how it compares to other phablets, but compared to the Note 4,it sucks! I have very big hands and this thing is still a little too wide,the big screen is nice otherwise, but it might as well be a tablet, where as the Note 4 is a lot more easily handable and in my opinion a true phablet.<br/><br/>Not having a led notification without root is just unacceptable.  So far I can't say anything good about this phone other than the large screen.
Incredible phone
Love this phone.
Excellent phone
Ugh, this is a tough review for me. I LOVE this phone. Love, love, love it. I love the screen and the over size. Motorola makes some really nice stuff. Now the bad. I bought this to work on Tmobile. While it does work, you aren't going to get LTE. You also aren't going to get wifi calling. You're better off buying the phone from Tmobile sadly.
When I opened undamaged sealed Nexus 6 box, item would not power on and back cover blown out of frame. Was waiting to receive from UPS at home so could join Project Fi. Live in desert Southwest. Check on net for "Nexus 6 back cover." Apparently is a problem this phone and an expanding battery.
This $400 phone was great until it barely tapped the ground and shattered. Like, it LITERALLY... tapped the ground and the whole screen shattered. I would understand if it was a bad fall, but it wasn't. Seems like an expensive phone would have better glass. Should have got a Galaxy. Highly disappointed. :(
Too bulky.
I figured everyone crying about the size of this thing was just wining. That their hands were small, and that being able to use one hand was a luxury I wouldn't miss... I was wrong. No, I didn't really miss the ability to use my phone one handed, what I missed was being able to reach every corner of the screen with my thumb. Using the phone with one hand isn't the problem, it's using it efficiently. To use the entire phone you have to re-position your hand if you have any hope of reaching the top left hand corner of the screen with your right thumb. And holding the phone is uncomfortable if you go about it as you're used to, you have to hold it like you've never held a phone before. I'm better off sticking with my Nexus 5 and getting a tablet if I want something this big. The Nexus 6 is just unnecessary and inconvenient.<br/><br/>Software also left much to be desired. I would click the "Hangouts" application and the Contacts application would be the one to open. Once or twice would have been okay but it happened over half a dozen times in about the two hours I experimented with the device.<br/>My Nexus 5 might have started to lose some battery life, but at least the phone itself still worked.
Perfect

Amazing
Do not purchase this phone from amazon. It ships with version lnx07m, the original build of androind 5.0. Because it ships with a build that is so old, you can not update it over a conventional over the air update, meaning you won't be able to update this phone past 5.0. That means its not compatible with google Fi. Google Fi won't work with phones less than 5.1.  Just FYI. Super dissatisfied.
Coming from an iPhone, I'm not a fan of this phone. I bought it for the "pure" Android experience and the positive experience I've had with other Motorola phones. However, this is not just bulky, it doesn't fit right in the hand. It's awkward to press the button and still use one-handed. Basically, just doesn't feel right... Adding a case to this makes it even more awkward.
Screen cracked for no reason now touch does not work and its $175 to repair. 2nd nexus to break for no reason.
This was a mistake, i didnt write that review was a friend of me. im sorry, the prodcut is perfect amazon is the best
good
I love it *.*
I bought this phone through AT&T; 3 months ago. The charging port on the actual phone is broken, no matter what cord I use the phone will not charge. I tried to use my warranty to fix this defect, but apparently the warrant does not cover "physical damage". I would never buy a Motorola again.
Worst phone I've ever owned. It lasted about one day before the Bluetooth cut out. Great solutions like "Turn it off turn it back on" or "It's probably your apps cant be the phone" resulted in 6 hours of tech supporting it before getting so disgusted after the third system restore that it's now being returned. The phone has a long history of bugs and defects posted online, I will not be buying another one of these, I see now why Tmobile no longer carries them.
I'm unsure if I missed something in the description. But this nexus speakers are blown. And it has a European charger with it. Also I can't get lte on T-Mobile. I hope amazon corrects this.
Ok
Item arrived obviously previously opened. It has a defective screen that flickers constantly. After doing the system updates. Now it will not work at all. Motorola makes junk. Amazon will only offer refund and not replacement. Was on a great sale at the time. I am sure I will never buy another thing from Amazon again. It is clear they have no intention of helping a customer out. And just so I can keep this on point. I was not that impressed with the phone. It got very hot while doing updates. The camera is not that great and it was hard to do anything with it sitting on a table because it would rock back and forth.
So, If you are thinking of buying this phone to use on Verizon's towers, think again.<br/>I bought this and a nano-sim cutter. After all of my excitment, it turns out that once you put the SIM card in, because this is sold by motorola, not google play, the IMEI is not recognized by Verizon, and it will only get 3G signal. It came up LTE but said all circuits are busy when I tried to dial. Then I had the brilliant idea of dialing *228, which permanently tied me to 3G only on it. Went to the VZ store and, of course, they told me they couldn't help me because it wasn't a verizon-sold phone.<br/>I bought this phone because I wanted to be able to unlock the bootloader and root without having to rely on Verizon.<br/>**<br/>EDIT: I can only attest to the motorola-bought (Amazon) phone. Not the one from Google Play store. I haven't tested that one yet, but I did read that you wouldn't have issues with that one.<br/>http://www.androidpolice.com/2014/11/22/psa-cdma-carriers-probably-wont-activate-your-nexus-6-unless-it-was-purchased-from-google-play-or-that-carrier-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/<br/>check out the chart in that link.
Sending first unit back for a replacement. It will not keep a data signal. We're with T-Mobile but issues have been happening with every carrier, sprint & T-Mobile especially. After tweaking/changing APN settings, SIM card, and a ton of other stuff the only option left is phone replacement.
The unit I received has sound issues. Static all over the place. The volume during calls is also very low. Probably ok if you are alone at home, but I was in a grocery store and had issues understanding what I was told.<br/><br/>The screen is also bad. The resolution is ok. But the colors are just awful. Yellow is the new white! I had heard about AMOLED screen being overly warm, but this is just wrong... I really hope the next phone (hopefully la nexus 5 2015 later this year) will have an IPS screen.<br/><br/>The screen is also too big to my taste but still usable.<br/><br/>Let's say I'm not impressed. And it's clearly not worth the 580 I paid for. But I need a new phone and other flagships are just way more expensive so...<br/>I ordered a replacement because of the sound issue anyway. I hope the screen will be better.
I really tried to like this phone. It has some very solid things going for it -- that huge screen, the lightning quick processor, and a relatively big cache of memory. But the negatives are just too much to ignore.<br/><br/>First off, this phone might be the closest thing Android has to an iPhone. If you like that idea, more power to you. I miss being able to add my own ringtones. There's more to it than that, but that's the most glaring example. The days of tweaking and configuring are over, at least with the Nexus 6.<br/><br/>The curved back of the phone is elegant, but it also makes it impossible set the phone down and use it, unless you're using it to play spin the bottle, because it's GREAT at that. The ergonomics are just terrible. That slick back makes the phone practically suicidal -- it almost leaps out of your hand every chance it gets.<br/><br/>Unless my phone is defective, anyone that says the battery life is adequate is a casual user, and anyone that says it's good is an outright liar. I can kill the battery, from full to 10% (which triggers a shutdown) in just over four hours. FOUR HOURS. Seriously.<br/><br/>And speaking of batteries, why is everyone going to those horrible non-removable jobs? It makes the phone a lot less useful when it shuts down and you can't just swap in a new one.<br/><br/>Also, no memory card slot. For the love of God, why? Even 64gb, which is pretty good, starts to feel small when that's all you'll ever get.<br/><br/>I miss my Note 3.
I do not believe this is a new phone. Although it came sealed, it appears to be refurbished:<br/><br/>*The outside of the box (not the shipping box but the small box containing just the phone) has what appears to be a water stain with some sticky material covering most of the top.<br/><br/>*The screen protector is in place but has a thick layer of lint, as if someone had wiped it with toilet paper and the tissue rubbed off on it.<br/><br/>*There are dried green and brown blades of grass (!?) inside the box, some pieces about a centimeter long, but mostly finely broken up and stuck to the phone. This is a first for me .<br/><br/>*There are small nicks and dings on the back of the phone.<br/><br/>*Suspiciously, there were white labels covering the factory stickers on the outside of the box and obscuring information about the particular model inside.<br/><br/>I suppose it is new but that the Motorola factory doubles as a barn. Even if it were refurbished, it was not cleaned very well.<br/><br/>On the bright side, it doesn't smell and seems to work okay.
The big screen is hot
I bought it and it was alright.  I don't know if it's everything being encrypted or what but buttery smooth is not what I would call this phone.  I would call it 5000 grit sandpaper. Useful for some applications but for the most part pretty useless.  The stupid phone won't charge anymore, it uses battery like no other, and it is turtle slow more than it is 2 legged bunny fast.  I would NOT recommend this phone.  If you are reading this do yourself a solid and just get the 6P
I tried two units. Both had the same spots on the back. I think there is a problem with the shipping of these phone. There is no protective plastic on the back for shipping and it seems that the back is rubbing on the box during shipping causing the spots.  For 649.00 I think it needs to come to the consumer defect free.
I purchased this Nexus 6 to use in Google Project Fi, it was a bargain. It is yet to be activated, I have had weeks of aggravation waiting for Google to activate the phone, but good news!  Google has found out that this new unlocked Nexus 6 is attached to Tracfone, not unlocked and now I'm wondering if it's actually new. I'm shocked that this has happened, Google and I have wasted lots of time on this Nexus 6. What's going on Amazon?
Not recommended.
I purchased this phone for 650.00 two weeks ago.<br/><br/>Pros. The phone is big. Boots up very fast and runs apps and games with no lag .No extra apps preinstalled. 32GB of memory.Charges very fast and last 12 Hrs for me. The sound is amazing as well as the HD.<br/><br/>Cons. Not user friendly. Adding contacts is a task and sometimes messaging because it isnt easy to navigate. The phone has an enternal batter and no SD card. Also I recommend buying a more powerful phone charger for your car because my other chargers are not strong enough.The battery will last all day if your not gaming and watching videos constantly.  Im also having problems with the GPS not tracking and I have dropped calls. Finding photos is a chore.<br/><br/>Update : buy case immediately i  dropped my phone face down on and shattered front glass . The screen still works if I want to fix it ill have to pay my deductable of $175.00
For those haters who gave bad comments to the phone you all ignorants. If i have the money to buy it now for whatever price is my problem just dont give bad review to it because you cant aford the price. The phone is amazing, fastest phone in earth period. Extremely powerful, I highly recommend it.
the nexus 6 is really amazing but i'm really disappointed that there's no earpiece comes with the phone and i think that amazon must mention that in the description of the box continent
Overall performance is very good..Only screen resolution is below my expectation compared to Samsung S6..
Its OK
It's a great phone for what it is. But it's too big for me. I was worried it would be too big and those fears were realized
It updates everyday and i don't understand why, it is too big and not as fast as I expected. I'm not happy with this phone. I'm selling it and switching to something less bulky.
Until now its working very good, one problem is the screen size is really big!
I had the nexus 5 and it was a treat was eager to try the N6 wow where do I begin? Motorola failed me miserably on this. Too heavy impossible to operate with one hand battery life is a joke even if it charges in 15 minutes I don't care for that turbo charger I care about it lasting. Image quality is a step down from N5 am still unclear what the hype is about? OK great Google voice recognition much better than 5 but still am at loss with this one? Did they sit down and wonder " OK how can we come up with a phone twice as bad as competition "? Returning today!<br/>Don't know how could Motorola get it so wrong? Huge fan but going Samsung today!<br/>Shuss!
They should put IR sensors on these.
I'm a little bit in satisfy,
Is not unlocked, be careful
I miss earphone ...

The first phone I got kept rebooting so I had to factory reset it. Then there was a problem of the screen blacking out when I am on the phone and I cannot use it until the call ended. So I got a replacement. The replacement phone speaker had a lot of static. These are all within a week of using each phone. I ended up returning. This is way more problems than I want to deal with especially on a new phone.
Best phone they've ever used they say.
great phone if you only plan to use for 1 year. but the battery life will go down pretty bad after that. I feel like the signal is not as good as other phone too. I don't know why company like google are making such short life phone. As a phone, you should have best signal and best battery life. TO be honest, i don't really care if it is HHHH - HD screen or just HD screen. they are all good and most of us won't even care as it doens't bother us that much.
its big
Sadly, this phone would not activate on Verizon Wireless. I even went to a certified Verizon Wireless store, not a reseller. Of course, Verizon being the ego-maniacal company that they are, did not have my phone's IMEI number in their database nor would they add it. The rep tried using an active nano-sim card but that did not work either. I ended up having to get the Nexus 6 directly from Verizon. I even tried to use the sim card from my Verizon-branded Nexus 6 into this unlocked Nexus 6 and it STILL would not recognize it. Who knows, maybe there is something wrong with the phone. I hate having to use yet another cellular-branded phone but my hands were tied.
As my display name suggests...I love this phone.  It's amazing.  The only thing that had originally upset me about the phone is the mammoth size of it...and even that I've grown to love.
The product is awesome. But the packaging and handling was awful. I am very sad because of that. The appearance was compromised. It has dents in the back.
Way too big. Also I need a 64bit processor just like the nvidia x1.
this phone is not unblocked, disappointed
the battery runs out very quick
PROS:<br/>-Giant screen<br/>-Well made<br/>-Great front-facing stereo speakers<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>-Awkward to hold – it's huge<br/>-Slow camera focusing<br/>-No longer competitively priced<br/><br/>If you want a phone with a large screen, I’d recommend this one: http://bit.ly/1xOFmH1<br/>That’s not to say the Nexus 6 is a bad phone – far from it.
Bought the phone for my son it was $580. We had to send it back after a week because it overheated while charging (with the turbo charger). Apparently, Motorola is fully aware of problem and indicated it was a flaw with the phone. Needless to say, don't buy as it has some safety concerns/manufacturer defect.
Super disappointing after a great experience with the last nexus. Freezes constantly, keyboard types when I am not typing, and phone volume is extremely low. Bummed about this purchase in a big way.
refund!!!
I am not impressed with the performance of this phone. I have been using it for 6 months and cannot wait to get rid of it. It is very sluggish.
This cell phone is crap. I have issues with it losing signal. I am so annoyed with this phone and cant wait to get rid of it.
This device has multiple issues.  Following are the issues I have experienced with my original purchase and the replacement I have received. You can google every single issue that I have experienced. There are hundreds of people complaining about every single issue. I liked the phone, so I wanted to keep it, but new issues keep on appearing and I was unable to troubleshoot most of them.  This phone is only good for texting or web browsing. It is not made for making phone calls.  I love Amazon for their customer service and support. They helped me a lot in replacement and return process.<br/><br/>1. Static noise / hissing sound - You can hear static noise when making phone calls. These noises are gone if you use Bluetooth to make calls. I ended up requesting a replacement and the replacement had the same issue. Most of us won’t pay attention to the call quality, but this phone is supposed to make HD sound quality phone calls. No one on the amazon reviews has mentioned this issue.<br/><br/>2. No ringing when you make a phone call to some numbers - This is a very strange issue. You will not hear any ring if you call or you hear only one ring then phone goes silent until someone answers on the other end. You are not sure if the call is going through or no, but in reality the phone is ringing on the other end.  It does not happen with all the numbers. This is very annoying.<br/><br/>3. No notification numbers - You will not see how many emails you have or how many messages you have received because Apps do not show Notification Numbers.<br/><br/>4. Cannot block numbers - You cannot send a number into BLOCK LIST on this phone unless you add the number into contacts and then send the calls from the number to voice mail.<br/><br/>5. Pink hue  -  This is not a big issue, but it is there. Screen turns pink under minimal light setting. Only visible in dark.<br/><br/>6. Takes long / stuck on factory reset - this phone takes long if you do factory reset. Some of the people complaining about phone never turning on after factory reset. Mine took 30 mins. I had to do reset prior to sending it back.<br/><br/>If you have used brand names like - Samsung or Apple, this phone is not for you.
Not a good quality product, crashes all the time
I am 100% disappointed with this phone. I had high expectations given that both Google and Motorola are usually reliable. However I found out the hard way that this phone comes with a defect: it re-starts itself randomly several times a day for no reason. I looked it up online and found several complaints about the same problem. I tried deleting all third party apps and running the phone for a while and the reboots kept happening. I even noticed that the phone would reboot itself most of the times I tried to use an app that came with the phone. You would think maybe I downloaded some kind of virus, but the reboots started on day 1, even before I downloaded anything to it.<br/><br/>And then one day the flash button on the camera disappeared. I dont know what happened to it, I cant turn it on, so when I need to take pictures with no light I have to use Snapchat. This is really annoying.<br/><br/>Lesson learned: dont buy a smartphone for less than $600 (like the Samsung Galaxy and the IPhone). Unfortunately the cheaper options don't work apparently.
BEWARE - this phone DID NOT have Android OS Lollipop (5.0.1) installed on it - even though the product details / description on Amazon says it comes with Lollipop. Lollipop is REQUIRED to run Google Project Fi mobile service. This device had KitKat (4.4.4) on it - so I can NOT connect to Google Fi, without downloading several SYSTEM updates - which is taking forever, and not successful at this point. While I am in love with the Nexus 6 in theory - I am extremely upset with that this was shipped with KitKat, as I can not use it with Google Project Fi cellular service - yet.<br/>UPDATE: This phone eventually worked on Google Fi Network - but required 3 system download updates (5.0; 5.01 and 5.1.1), and then installation of "Project Fi" from the Google Play Store, before it would connect to Google Fi. So: it DOES work on Google Fi BUT you will have to spend about and hour updating the OS and installing Project Fi App.
Ego-central 'chic' mentality of Google turns a fine device into trash. If you have "old-folks"<br/>fingers - do not buy this. The keyboard is badly crafted - results in many spurious<br/>characters. If you try to use imap e-mail -- Google deliberately makes it hard.<br/>And where is the e-mail address book..? Google does not want us to know.<br/>Terrible non-documentation. Google tries to be so clever they ignore common<br/>function - software written by 'savants' - or should say 'idiot savants' - at once<br/>clever and stupid.<br/><br/>The display is superb. Audio is superb. Keyboard & mail are wretched.
:)
All I can figure is this is the AT&T; version of the phone, which was released early to AT&T; alone.  Do your research before you buy this phone.  Mine had the problem that many have had, in that it would not connect to mobile data.  I spent two hours on the phone with tech support, to no avail.  I understand if you use Sprint they may be able to fix the problem for you.
Google doesn't provide updates for nexus devices that are not sold by Google store. This is intolerable, I bought nexus phone for timely updated. And I don't want to flash my phone with pain of reconfigure.<br/><br/>This is not true nexus phone. Still waiting for update.<br/><br/>However no clue on who provides update for my phone.<br/><br/>Bad experience Google not a great support.
I do not know of it's the real nexus 6 , hard to find out but I am having issues , not downloading applications , screen touching is sometimes not working .<br/>Till now I am disappointed , i will try to go to a Tmobile store and see of they can solve what I can't .
very good item
Had to charge it daily (even with limited use) and it got very hot at nearly every charge & when the phone was used for more than 20 minutes. Not worth the price.
Edit: Now that I have my real Nexus 6 from google I can say that what I got from this order was actually nothing like it at all.  The basic shape and form are different - the buttons are not the same, it takes a different sized SD card.  Maybe there was just some mix up in shipping?<br/>------<br/>This is not a normal, unlocked Nexus 6 - it is not even branded as a nexus at all.  It comes with a LOT of apps and app folders that cannot be removed from the desktop and I'm not even sure if it will work with my t-mobile sim card.  Frankly I didn't try too hard given how ugly and inflexible the interface was - and who knows how much spyware might be on it.  I only bought through amazon instead of google directly because I wanted prime shipping, well now I have to send it back and then order from google, so, fail.
i have network connectivity issue.
Lots of issues on this.<br/><br/>I have bought this and 1st terrible experience was. No way you can keep this into silent mode. Even though it says silent, it vibrates like anything.<br/>To control that you have to install different app (Power Toggles).<br/><br/>Screen goes blank if you install screen cover to protect the screen from scratches. https://productforums.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm;_source=footer#!msg/nexus/mIRwBP4Hx_Y/quCNIga8ob8J<br/><br/>No fix for this so far.<br/><br/>Google says, it is Motorola issue. Motorola says google software issue. Whoever, no one takes responsibility to fix this. This is the only place where apple beating Android which is called customer service. I have used it 1 month. It was terrible experience with nexus 6.
This phone is amazing. Best phone on the market right now.
Horrible experience!!!! I ordered this phone for myself as an early birthday present was so exited to get it it took the prime 2 day shipping. I opened the box and there it was the huge nexus 6 box along with a tempered glass protector and a clear spigen case. Got the protector on the phone no problem and the case was a perfect fit. Setting up my simcard was easy I power up the phone the screen is beautiful i go thru the google set up update all the apps set up my 7 email accounts everything was going perfect. Then the device reboots..... i used to fix phones so 1 reboot wasnt the end of the world i thought. REBOOT,REBOOT,REBOOT,REBOOT,REBOOT THE REBOOTS WONT STOP!!!! What a letdown. I contacted Amazon for a replacement but since i did not purchase this with a credit card they couldnt process the replacement. They suggested I return the device wait for my refund 7-10 days after they receive the device then reorder it again. For a flagship device the software problems are unacceptable and so was the solution by amazon you have lost a customer after more than 10 years of shopping here.
I've had this phone for almost a week. I just can't get the battery to last me for even 2/3 of a day. The first day I had it, I left my house for work at 7a.m. with 100%. By noon, the battery was at 57%. How sad! This is the most beautiful, fastest, biggest phone I've ever owned. The pictures come out so crisp and clear, and I can't even begin to talk about how wonderful android 5.0 lollipop is. The whole problem is the battery. The power saving mode doesn't help much at all. Then, most of the battery save apps on Google play aren't compatible with android lollipop... If you're a moderate heavy phone user, as in, you check emails and Facebook throughout the day and like to use the gps while driving, then your doomed, like me. The phone takes about two hours to charge!<br/><br/>One update to this review, I finally found out how to turn off mobile data in the settings menu. If you keep data off at all times, except when you need to use data, then your battery will last longer. Of course, this means no notifications will be received until you turn the data back on and you'll have to turn on your data if you want to send or receive a picture MMS text message. Turning off data basically means you will only be able to use basic text messaging and make/receive phone calls. I looked up battery tests and it turns out that large phones, called "phablets" take lots of battery power. In battery testing I researched online, the Samsung Galaxy note 4 only had about one hour more worth of power compared to the nexus 6 when being used continuously nonstop.
The first Nexus 6 I got had a cracked display.  The replacement I have had for two weeks and a couple rows in the display are "dead".  Very distracting... doesn't got away with reboot.<br/><br/>Has this fabrication issue been fixed?  Not sure if I should return or replace...
I bought this on Black Friday for a low price, so I'm not complaining. BUT I thought it was identical to the stock Nexus 6P -- the same exact thing but with a Motorola badge and perhaps some added Motorola apps and stuff.<br/><br/>It's not. It's a step down in many ways. The Nexus 6P has a Snapdragon 810, Adreno 430 GPU, and 3450 mAh battery -- all better than this version.
My second Nexus, my 8th Android phone. Unequivocally the worst phone ever made this side of the galaxy III. For how big it is, the battery life is Terrible. I've taken this thing off of the charger at 4pm and I'm getting the low battery warning by 10pm. It lags, something with the memory or the processor happens where the thing chugs along like a coal locomotive in a world of high speed trains. Lollipop up to this point has felt unfinished and unintuitive, the overall feel is clunky. Then there's the android issue... Yes you get the latest iteration of android, but major apps (such as banking) do not have anything ready until Samsung comes to market with updates for their galaxy devices. This experience may have soured me on Android altogether, its too fragmented. Unless you code apps and need this thing, this phone is a monstrosity! You would do well to avoid it.
i just got today 9/21/2015, but camera not working, how can i do?
I'm a Nexus user since Nexus 4, now i have Nexus 5 and the Nexus 6 is the best upgrade for me. Better camera, better screen, better phone!<br/><br/>Regards!
I am disappointed in the purchase
Been using Samsung's for years thought I would try native android on Motorola's flagship device.  Everything requires an app.  Battery percentage, unread SMS followup reminders.  In addition to the phone not ringing at times and not giving notifications at times and at other times the speakers sounded blown.  The GPS was inaccurate at times.  My spouse and I have an app that can locate the others phone.  When he was shown to be in the middle of a quarry's private land but was really 7 miles away that was the final straw.  The vendor was great to work with, the problem is with the phone hardware and native software.  Returned them both and got Samsung Note 4's.  I hope your experience is better than ours.
It is quite disappointing when I found out that my Nexus 6 is unstable and it will auto reboot intermittently. Plus, I've only used it for less than a week and the return shipping fees is cost me A$112, which is horrible expensive! I think I made a wrong decision on buying this phone. It's utterly disappointed.
I have a lot of problems with my nexus 6. I lost conectivity frequently and i have to restart it. Often I try to call somebody and the phone tilt while dialing, again i have to restart it. y dont know if it is the phone or the android.
I purchased a Nexus 6 from my carrier, T-Mobile, in December 2014. At this point, I've had the Nexus 6 for 9 months and, while I like the screen and battery life, there are so many little things that bug me about it and features missing that I'm scratching my head wondering what Motorola/Google were doing in making some design decisions and what I was doing buying it.<br/>It's missing an LED to indicate it's powering up and allowing apps to notify me of such things as new messages while enabling a truly silent mode. Silent mode is a do-not-disturb mode that is quite kludgey, IMHO. When set to do-not-disturb mode I have to switch on the screen to find out if I have a new message. Otherwise I get vibrations and little pings and knocks through the day from all sorts of apps that want or need my attention. It'd be so nice to - like I did with my last phone - see a new message has arrived through Whatsapp (green), new email through K9 (red) or Yahoo (purpley-blue), etc. But no, I need to open up the screen to see if there are new notices. It gets old.<br/>The power button should be on the top of the phone. I can't tell you how many times I've hit the power button instead of volume or accidentally shut down the phone while walking with it in hand.<br/>It took more than 9 months for Google and Motorola to introduce Wi-Fi calling even though it was advertised as supported when I bought my phone. They strung me and others along until August before delivering.<br/>I dislike the pure Android experience and am embarrassed to admit I miss TouchWiz. I really can't get over the the limited home screen and organization, so much so that I had to install Yahoo's Aviate and am tempted to install another ROM such as cyanogenmod.<br/>All that said, the Nexus 6 isn't entirely bad. The screen and sound are awesome, the phone generally keeps its connection better than other phones I've had, and the battery life is phenomenal so far. It also gets security patches faster than other phone manufacturers, which is nice. But I should have bought the competing product with a built in stylus.
Just got it around 1 week, it droped from my car (around 40cm), and got broken screen/glass. It's so fragile. My HTC and iphone 6+ which also have big screen, they came aross simliar situations, but no problem at all. Will never recommond nexus series to anyone else.
Good phone... Bad service
I didn't know this when I bought it but there is no notification light that alerts you to any SMS, MMS, email or phone call. You cannot re-arrange the apps in the order you like.  They are automatically arranged in alphabetical order.  You cannot remove the Google search bar from the home screen. Supposedly this phone has a TURBO charge capability that is faster when plugged into AC. I used the OEM charger that came in the box to charge my phone when it was at about 30%. It took a little over an hour to charge the phone to 100%. I think I read somewhere that this phone stated took about 16 minutes to bring it to a 75% capacity. One of the comments that I saw said that it was difficult to hold and use with one hand. Not that my hands are huge but I can use just one hand to do anything on this phone. I do like the 6" display.  It is a little bulkier than most phones and heavier.
Hello!They wanted to know if solved the problem of the battery swells.<br/> I want to buy this phone but I fear that swells battery
There are proximity sensor problem which causes screen to go blank while making a call, if using screen protectors. This is actually an android issue which google does not want to fix and instead is asking users to take off the screen protector.<br/>That is stupid considering nexus has one of the most fragile screens.<br/><br/>Have been waiting for 5 months for a fix and still no sign of it.<br/><br/>Never had problems like this with my iphone...
own it, love it
s***
Third replacement and still came scratched out of the box. Packaging was awful.
Current list price is a lie.
I only giving them three stars because I need to keep checking it, is too early to know how good it is.
Overall good phone. I bought 2 though and in one of them flash/flashlight does not work.<br/>What's worse is that it seems like someone tampered with it. Did I get refubrished phone ?
Good phone, but it needs more features like TV remote.
Good one
Still waiting for this phone to be available. This is a great device.. Worth waiting for.
I hate it. It's poorly made. It was dropped less than 2 feet from the ground and the screen shattered and it isn't covered by the warranty. The phone is not popular anywhere except in VERY urban areas and there is NO PLACE that sells protection for it nearby, including the At &t; Store, and they have everything. (That's within 30 miles, and I'm 90 minutes away from Chicago). I truly regret not buying a more popular Samsung or Apple device when I was shopping. At least you can buy protection for them pretty much any where. Now I'm out hundreds of dollars that took me forever to save for this purpose and still need a phone. I will NEVER buy another Motorola product again and definitely will not try to purchase it online. Overall it has been an awful and expensive learning experience.
But a bit expensive
Not bad
The wireless charger is not worked in Starbucks.
Bad news - this phone is discontinued, a newer better model is about to be released, so its not actually on sale, they are trying to unload these.  I returned mine because it does not work with Metro PCS (a GSM carrier) owned by T-Mobile even tho the description says it works with T-mobile.  So don't buy this if you want to use Metro PCS, and Google never responded to my request for FI - poor service = I'd suggest not buying google products!
This device is seriously fragile. It slipped from my fingers into the grass, possibly finding the only rock, and cracked the screen. It is already so big that I hadn't put one of the cases around it as well, I did have a basic screen protector though.
Received defective.
Too big in size for cell phone.
0/10
I am a fan of the Nexus line, I have had the 4 and enjoyed it& showing it off against contemporary Iphone's, I am purchasing the 5 and was pleased with it as well. That being said, I was anticipating the 6 with great enthusiasm but was greatly let down. This is a Moto X on steroids and it might sound o.k but at its current price -point it denotes the theme the Nexus line has continuously championed; a fluid and competitive phone at a cheap price in comparison. Yet, this phone is outrageously priced for the specs it carries and the phone hardware it is structured in. If it wasnt for the 1+1 being invite only phone, it is a much better phone at $350.
the phone is alright nice battery life camera is alright also<br/><br/>Amazon selling this device is a little concerning due to the fact i bought this item less than 7 days ago for 339 32gb version and now today they are selling the same phone but 64gb version for 259.99 when taking with a rep they couldnt do anything for me in the case of giving me the difference or even offering to send me the 64gb version instead but nothing at all just saying sorry for your troubles amazon is always great and ready to help but in this case poor customer service this is unsatisfactory
Garbage phone freezes
No screen shot no wi fi calling the most dumdest f$#&ing; phone I ever used I cursed the day I cursed the day I brought this phone
This is by far the worse phone I ever have. The new Lollypop andorid is not ready. Lots of issues. I will not recomended at all. Stay away. It was so bad that for the first time ever in my life, I bought an Apple Iphone 6 plus. Android is by far more advance software but very unstable nd that is what I gained with the Iphone.
I will buy
You guys know what, this defective s*** can't even be turned on. Google published a guide telling us to press button 15 seconds and wait for turning on. Come on, it won't work no matter how long you do it. So disappointed by Google mobile device. Going for Apple.
One hour battery life. Eight hour charging time. Even after four hours of charging (and while it is still charging) it will not let you boot up.
I want it to be the arrival as soon as possible
Does this phone comes with a standard headset or not?
Pros<br/>-Large battery life 3200 mah. Will almost last a day on full charge<br/>- Quad HD screen. One of the best displays out there<br/>- Turbo Charge: With turbo charge one can charge the battery to a substantial amount within a few minutes<br/><br/>Cons<br/>- Screen size is a bit too large and can be cumbersome to fit in pockets<br/>-Camera quality is not very good<br/>-No power saving mode in android L
I've had a lot of problems with this phone and am not happy with it.  It won't save addresses correctly and I've sent products to wrong locations many times.
Way overpriced! Do not buy it!! All carriers will sell the Nexus 6 everywhere including on Amazon! In November!!!
Dude I bought my Moto X with Zgadget, now your price is ridiculous.

Someone is going to have to be pretty desperate to order this for $950.
Don't buy it for this price. Not worth it. Wait for a few more days and buy with carrier or order it from Google/Motorola websites!
bwahahahahah ahhhhhh bwahahahahaha
Scalping is not cool.
are you kidding?? ill go eat some flying monkeys if someone buys this phone
Don't feed greed.
Over priced
bad price
I am not going to pay for that $$$, people knows the SRP.
Overpriced
Wait and save 300$+
Are you really going to pay 649/699 over a phone that does the same things that a Samsung S3 or Moto G 2nd Generation? This phone is doomed in terms of sales. #NotWorthIt.
so bad its so Expensive
Phone is not worth the price
