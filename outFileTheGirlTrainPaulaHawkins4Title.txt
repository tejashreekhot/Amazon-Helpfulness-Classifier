Anyone riding the train to work

and certainly more difficult to enjoy. The anxiety level of this book surpassed what ...
Confusing!

This book was really good
This is a great book set in England
Now this was FUN!
Pagingplaces is the best place on Amazon!
I did figure out what was going on before the "Big Reveal" but I still enjoyed the storyline and how the characters paths crosse
disappointing
Beautifully done
Good read

Girl on the Train, Good not spectacular
Great page-turner
Both sad & fantastic. But...

Excellent
Moody and provocative.
Definitely a good "thriller"!
Amazing page turning thriller
I will never ride a train again without thinking of Rachel!!!!
Don't spend money on this book!
Cannot believe all the praise
depressing but kept me guessing
... was written was interesting but the overall plot was pretty predictable and by halfway in you totally know "who ...
Mediocre
What's all the fuss about this book????
Nosy Neighbor on the Train
Worth your time
A twist I didn't see coming
Don't plan on putting this book down.

ridiculous. not one likeable character.
Great mystery story that keeps you interested until the very end.
Tough ending
Dismal and dreary

utterly boring
Not bad for a women writer, I guess, but not my style.  Guess I'll stick with The Executioner series; more action & fewer pages!
Chick lit?
