[(u'H', (u'i wont go into the details of what the chromebook is as many reviewers already have done so i live my life in google drive so the lack of onboard applications is not an issue for me almost every application you used to have to install now has a web version  most are free even i purchased my chromebook as a home computer when my imac finally gave up the ghost i couldnt afford to do a full replacement and i needed a computer for home i have it connected to a 24 lcd monitor and my existing sound system via hdmi for the price this chromebook is amazing it does most basic browsing email streaming functions beautifully unfortunately where it chokes is graphics and images im not talking cad  im talking photo rendering graphics intensive websites and even google maps on imagery the poor little processor just isnt designed to handle that much imagery data it even stutters when using its own email inbox app if i could do it id buy a dedicated desktop as my home base and use the chromebook as my mobile computer what i like lightweight affordable compact fast for basic browsing streams videos flawlessly well built quiet comfortable keyboard great touchpad beautiful screen nicely integrated with google and its various applications plays well with peripherals external monitor keyboard trackball what i dont like chokes on graphic intensive processing google earthmaps chokes on google photos caveat  i have nearly 20000 photos in my google drive chokes on photo enhancement again  graphic intensive slow on its own email google inbox  this really irritates me has trouble streaming music and multitasking ive never been a fan of streaming music services anyway i have yet to find one that is consistent and stable it works fine for streaming music by itself but im usually working and doing other things while im listening at my computer and it frequently stutters as the processor overloads you have to be very aware of how many browser tabs you have open 5 or more and you start having issues i know youre saying but the chromebook isnt designed to be a rendering powerhouse i would totally agree with you  except when it comes to googles own applications inbox maps summary  i really think this chromebook is a well thought out welldesigned unit it does what it is designed for very well my concern is that as web pages become more information packed the processing power is going to have to be boosted', u'i love my chromebook   but', (4L, 1L, u'null', 0L, u'Unidentified', 2412, 26))), (u'H', (u'i am enjoying this computer couldnt have made a better

nearly half the cost upon receiving it build quality was very nice and for the most part the computer was very quick and responsivethanks to the ssd no doubt however i had problems the main problems were with the screen tracpad and wifi the screen the display had very lousy color accuracy and the whites were completely blown out im not an expert nor do i have the equipment to adjust the display properly so this was quite the dissapointment in addition to that the matt display had a haze over it that makes anything on the display just look worse than it should the wifi adapter the wifi would continuously cut out on both 24 and 5ghz networks tested in different locations with a variety of different routers all windows updates were installed the latest asus drivers were installed and i eventually went and got some third party drivers and nothing worked the trackpad the trackpad is very large and seemingly nice however when using it it is no where near sensitive enough and someone like myself and also my wife who have somewhat moist skin find the trackpad to be very sticky and hard to drag a finger on comfortably the acceleration profiles on the trackpad are horrible and trying to do anything both quickly and accurately is impossible also the trackpad clicker is both hard to press and extreemely loud not a pleasant experience at all minor complaints the speakers the speakers dont sound greatexpected however they are very quiet situate yourself in a very quiet room if you expect to use them sd card reader the sd card sticks way out and is not a great connection the battery the battery never performed as advertised in the first two weeks of use it never exceeded 6 hrs and this is with using ie instead of chrome and being careful not to do anything very power intensive using chrome will take another hour off your battery life things i like i love the price for what you get it is not beatable anywhere else the keyboard the keyboard is great better than that of my macbook i dare say lacks backlight however it is very nice to type on the processor the processor may be limited to 5w however it is quite a good performer exporting 35 raw photos from lightroom takes approximately one minute i did not try video editing however i was never in a situation that the processor slowed me down much which honestly is what suprized me most i really wanted to like this computer and by the specs i feel like i should however with all the problems that i had the computer was returned i may look at their next generation as i really want a computer in this form factor',

to use and very nonresponsive 2 the wifi antenna is very low quality and has alot of difficulty picking up signals that other devices have no problem connecting to i am returning this little laptop and instead buying the samsung chromebook mainly because it has the dual antenna wifi for the same price you can buy the asus cromebook with double the ram and probably a slightly better trackpad but

no issues as well as the keyboard the keyboard to me is identical to mac laptops somewhat only thing that this laptop is missing is the light under the keyboard so that you are able to see the letters at night but that is no big deal its very fast and responsive i did not notice any screen flickering as some reviews mentioned at least not yet will update my review after few months of use if i

it to work the touchpad is not the best to navigate it closes down unexpectedly and is very slow loading videos websites etc i feel like it is loaded with viruses without viruses also i have only used

decent build quality this is a win all around', u'an apple guy impressed by a nonapple product', (4L, 1L, u'null', 0L, u'Unidentified', 539, 44))), (u'H', (u'i like this toshiba a lot so much so that i may start using it instead of a year old 17 inch dell laptop with windows 81 since i am so pleased with the toshiba i couldnt understand the many one and two star ratings after reading many of those low ratings i realized that many of those lower ratings are for an earlier model of the toshiba one with windows 8 so for whatever reason this listing is a mix of reviews for essentially two different models maybe more my experience so far set up was a breeze i just plugged in the laptop and started using it first sharing some information with toshiba and registering the computer documentation is sparse on the computer is an extensive electronic owners manual which isnt much help if your computer isnt working that once happened to me on the dell but luckily i had another computer for accessing the needed information i like windows 10 quite a bit and theres even a little bit of help with windows 10 on the toshiba eventually i may have to get a windows 10 book or start watching some windows 10 help videos on youtube but ive been figuring things out so far and like the design of windows 10 quite a bit this is coming from someone who doesnt like change for whatever reasons this computer is very fast much faster than my dell whether im just using the internet or writing reviews pictures and sights load very fast when watching videos on netflix and youtube theres never any hesitation or spinning circles on the screen speaking of the screen i have no complaints about the picture quality of the screen whatsoever for viewing movies or editing photographs cortana is a great feature its fun to ask her silly questions and it is so convenient to ask her to find something for me on the computer and then open it for me if i want to got to the ebay site for example i tell cortana and ebay comes right up the 8 g of memory and the one terabyte hard drive are more than enough for me  with a hard drive massive enough to hold all of the photographs ive taken and will take with windows 10 theres a way to sync my phone and laptop and be able to easily share files between the two i started the process but then decided it was too convoluted for me and quit the set up halfway through maybe later ill give it another shot but at the moment i dont have a need for that feature some have complained about the keyboard but i like the feel and look of it especially having the number pad on the right as is found on 17 inch laptops not much bloatware on this laptop at all many of the computers ive had and have currently came with lots of unnecessary stuff that can be tedious to remove this toshiba has the bare necessities ive read that this is not a gaming machine something that doesnt affect me at all the simple games ive played on this computer have been flawless for a casual gamer  this computer is probably fine sound  its not amazing sound but good enough to enjoy listening to music or watching movies true audiophiles most likely will hook up bluetooth speakers anyway aesthetics and form  this model weighs 482 pounds so is easy to carry about or set on your lap the case is plastic and the two near corners are rough and should have been rounded for looks and convenience i like the looks of the brushed look on the black case but do have a problem with fingerprints even on the black if you are looking for a reasonably priced laptop with a huge hard drive then certainly consider this toshiba and dont be put off by the new windows 10 its actually a good upgrade', u'windows 10 toshiba', (5L, 0L, u'TOP 50 REVIEWER', 0L, u'Windows 10', 3527, 18))), (u'NH',

that he could use for schoolwork that was also powerful enough to run his favorite games the machine itself is sleek lightweight and nice to look at the body is slightly curved around the edges of the keyboard and the touchpad has a bit of a rough texture that i have not experienced on other machines the plastic corners of the machine could be smoother and i have found them to be fairly uncomfortable to touch the touchpad is not centered on the body so its a bit awkward to use depending on where my hands are positioned i find myself hitting the right mouse button too frequently also the numeric keypad is directly adjacent to the standard keys so its not uncommon to hit the wrong key when trying to press enter the initial setup of the machine was fairly easy even for a windows 10 novice like myself but i had to overcome three annoying problems in the first couple of days first it would not connect to my wireless network i use an apple airport extreme which works flawlessly with all of my various computers and devices but for some inexplicable reason this laptop would not obtain an ip address after connecting the network kept coming up as limited it took some searching before i landed on a blog post that explained how to solve the issue by entering a series of command line codes httpwwwthewindowsclubcomfixlimitedwificonnectionprobleminwindows81 miraculously this worked even though i have no idea what these commands do the second issue i had was that this machine had some default settings that disabled the touchpad when keys were entered on the keyboard i realize that this may be useful in some situations it makes many games impossible to play i had to spend a considerable amount of time looking through the system settings to figure out how to turn off this feature finally i experienced a problem where the sound would spontaneously stop working after certain programs were opened for example many games were silent until i restarted the machine this seems to be a known issue in windows 10 and specifically with these models and i was able to overcome this problem by updating the sound driver but it was an annoying thing to have to do these problems surprised me as i had expected that a machine preinstalled with the latest os would have fewer software issues i hope these are isolated problems but i suspect that there are probably more

so i am happy have not tried to use the laptop for heavy duty stuff such as gaming video conversion  so cant comment on that the touchpad driver needs to be updated for gestures to work properly dont know why asus did not have working driver installed after i updated the bios 210 the laptop could not find a boot drive to boot so it got stuck and bios screen eventually i found a youtube video asus zenbook ux32a boot fix and following the instruction to change three boot setting to get the laptop to boot this is totally inexcusable so the hardware is very good but the software is flawed but easily corrected', u'nice affordable ultraportable but watch out for bios update', (4L, 1L, u'null', 0L, u'Unidentified', 757, 59))), (u'H', (u'this is an amazing laptop as long as it is bought for the right person i am currently a full time student who really needs a laptop on the go on this laptop i have microsoft office 2013 not office365 adobe acrobat xi pro mcafee internet security suite and some other light applications the first time i did updates i was really scared because i saw that toward the end there was only 224mbs remaining however after the update was completed it shows approximately 226gb remaining in order to combat the low storage space remaining i went ahead and bought a sony 64gb sd card for only 25 on amazon that was a great buy as of now i only have my applications on the ssd all of my documents photos and videos are kept on the memory stick i have no complaints about the keyboard in fact i really like it the keys actually go in and is pretty responsive as far as the trackpad is concerned it definitely could use some improvements at first using it was a hassle after 34 days it became second nature the performance for this laptop is okay as long as youre not planning on using photoshop i use adobe acrobat pro xi which can be a very demanding software a lot on this machine so far i have not had any issues video playback seems to be very good one problem i did notice was when i was running chrome having 2 or 3 tabs along with iheart radio seemed to create a distortion for the audio the audio would just stop and then restart the battery on this laptop is pretty amazing the battery seems to be on for around 6 hours and 30 minutes at low brightness no audio and only mild surfing and word processing the laptop color scheme is a lot better person when you actually hold it rather than looking at it in front of a computer screen the 25 microsoftcom voucher and free office365 membership for 1 year is a total steal i think that this will help out a lot of students that are going off to college this year or someone with a tight budget the screen is usual you will not be able to see the pixels on the display unless you are staring at it close the laptop is fanless so there isnt noise being generated by the laptop also there isnt any heat i had a hp pavilion laptop before that generated so much heat that it became unbearable to use unless i had a pillow underneath it this laptop does produce some heat but hardly any you wont be able to feel it unless youre wearing short and it comes into direct contact with your skin as a student who uses this laptop daily i can gladly recommend this laptop to the majority update i have created two backups of the recovery partition and will be calling hp soon to ask if the recovery partition can be deleted as that will free up around 730gb update 21815 so i have been using this laptop for about 4 months now and have to say how amazed i continue to be with this laptop the keyboard is great and i have not been having any problems using it the trackpad also hasnt caused me any problems yet my only problem would be in regards to the ram and ssd i constantly get error messages notifying me that i am running out of space windows has also closed all of my running programs to increase ram this is quite frustrating also the ssd is a major problem as well before i had adobe acrobat xi and microsoft office 2013 installed but could not install any updates due to the lack of space i deleted acrobat xi and got back around 12gb but it eventually got reduced to 900mb due to more updates the recovery partition is approximately 72 gb and cannot be deleted trying to delete it tampers with the security feature on board and it will disable you from accessing the windows operating system in order to bypass this i will try to install windows 7 ultimate on this laptop by disabling uefi secure boot and if it successful then i will try to delete the recovery partition the battery life is excellent however the laptop does get somewhat heated after 23 hours of use not unbearable by any means the display is average nothing to really admire about playing youtube videos can be a frustrating experience playing in 720p does not start any problems however if you decide to play in 1080p be prepared to see a lot of stuttering i have installed the magic actions for youtube and have seen all the issues that i was experiencing go away the following are my settings for this addon  enable auto hd it will be selected at 480p by default change this to hd720p or hd1080p if you do not have fast internet i would recommend that you keep it at 480p  hide ads enable this as it will prevents any ads from appearing if you are looking for an adfree experience in chrome i would highly recommend that you install adblock from httpswwwgetadblockcom  speed booster i also choose this option as it loaded 720p videos much faster i didnt see a significant difference with 1080p  use mp4avc video stream when available this is going to change the video file format using mp4avc will reduce the cpu usage which will aid in a stutter free video watching experience  i will update this video in another two months if you have any questions feel free to ask below i spend a lot of time writing reviews if this review has helped you make a decision

much enjoyed using since my old zenbook prime ux31a circa 2012 i was hesitant to buy it since i was dissatisfied with my zenbook ux303ln but i do not regret getting this i checked it out at my local microcenter before making the decision and the first thing that comes to mind is wow is this thing thin according to anandtech reviews it is about half a millimetre thinner than the new macbookthe one with a single port and on this one you get three fullsize usb ports i was additionally hesitant to buy it because of the core m processor but this thing holds itself really well in all day to day tasks additionally all the hardware seems to work out of the box with linux apart from the screen brightness keys but keymapping utilities and xautomation can be used to solve this problem the 256gb ssd is more than large enough to dual boot windows 8 and arch linux for me though arch is my primary system the only time i have noticed this laptop slowing down is during large file transfers from my home server since the core m cpus tend to handle themselves better in quick few operation tasks where they can turbo on tasks which take some time like file transfers the cpu limits itself to its base frequency while it gets hot when doing tasks such as installing an operating system during day to day use it does not get nearly hot enough to make it uncomfortable to use on your lap the display is superb from my experience and i have always liked the matte displays keyboard is as comfortable as you can expect from a device so thin touchpad works well and is supported by recent linux kernels so clearly asus ditched focaltech as a vendor but again i really must emphasize how thin and liight this machine is i am astonished that they can make a machine so thin which is perfectly powerful and still has such a wide selection of ports if youre on edge about buying this laptop because of the price i would go for it apart from the lack of keyboard backlighting which is not really a deal for me

is still relevant to this specific product first off i want to note that this is not a powerhouse computer  no computer at 700 and less is a powerhouse computer for the price you are getting some great specs and great hardware heck the 1300 macbook 12 has the same specs reletively the hard drive is fast the ram is adequate for most everyone the screen is bright and very pleasant to view and the battery life is great i really like the keyboard on this unit and am able to type just as quick as on larger laptops and desktop keyboards everything just feels very well done and feels more expensive than what you are paying this is a far cry different than the hp 17 i have been using i can carry this in a bag along with its power adapter an ipad and its power adapter for basically the same weight as just the bag that held my larger laptop without the laptop in it it is incredible how portable this laptop is and how well it works in my daily work in the courthouse and airplanes i use this machine for web research and surfing  some video watching spreadsheets emails word docs and some mapping it can handle most of this without a hickup the mapping part is not as easy as it is on larger more powerful units with dedicated graphics  but this machine was not designed to do this task i can deed plot just fine but it starts to lag when working in gis software not a deal breaker for me issues windows 8 enough said but it doesnt mean a star needs to be taken off the laptop and hey windows 10 is coming out in a couple months depending on when you are reading this the trackpad is pretty darn good compared to many other windows laptops i have tried during my shopping but it does not have the option to reverse the twofinger scrolling and its multi touch setting are a little finicky it is a little loud when clicking  doesnt bother me much at all sometimes it thinks i am three finger swiping and will minimize my current program rare or sometimes thinks i am trying to zoom inout less rare i purchased the signature edition of this machine from microsoft so it does not have any of the extra software that computer manufacturers throw on their machines that said it is probably a little faster than the normal ones from asus i really like using the machine and have suggested it to many of my coworkers  some of whom have gone off and purchased it after trying mine for the money i dont think there is anything out there as good or near as good there are more powerful machines like the xps 13 but its going to cost you some serious coin to get the 256gb ssd and the 8gb ram  about 1100 for that version of the xps 13 i personally will save the 400  i dont really need the core i5 processor that much for internet big spreadsheets some mapping it would be nice but not needed i also got my ux305 on sale for only 599 so the argument was that much bigger for the asus', u'great laptop for the price  excellent value', (5L, 0L, u'null', 0L, u'Unidentified', 2945, 43))), (u'NH', (u'dont purchase this laptop this laptop does not have the specs i hoped for but anyways ill get to that later i usually dont do reviews but this product  amazon support has put through a lot of frustration that i decided to write an honest review about this product had i paid more attention to the specs i wouldnt have purchased this product in the first place this laptop is the ux305fa model there is another one that costs 50 more on amazon that is the ux305la model for 50 more you get an intel processor that is much better than the core m the latest intel processors go from best to least best in the following chronological order intel i7 intel i5 this is what the ux305la has intel i3 and the m core what the ux305fa currently has so hopefully this will convince you to add 50 more to get a processor that is way better than that fa model ok so the proscons pros thin makes it very easy to carry around especially since i am a college student battery life works wonderful storage is of plenty display is amazing cons trackpad is noisy and sometimes clumsy i use a logitech remote bluetooth mouse to solve the issue usb port does not recognize devices connectsdisconnects

review from four stars to two stars and im returning this machine after using it for a couple of days the heating issue is just too much of a problem to ignore running a browser and a word processor it gets hot running windows updates in the background it gets hot uncomfortably hot to the point where its uncomfortable through clothes and impossible to place on a lap if youre wearing shorts another issue ive noticed after using it for a couple of days is that the battery life indicator is all over the place one moment it says theres ten hours of charge left and the next it goes down to three i ended up timing a full charge with a stopwatch running it on the balanced power option and it came out around 56 hours im leaving the rest of my review intact below for anyone who is still thinking of buying it but the heat issue makes this machine a no go for me original review below i bought this laptop and a macbook air in the same week to try them out and ultimately went with this machine over the air i use a lot of asus products and ive found that theyre either solid workhorses that go forever or they have a glaring production flaw that renders them useless pretty quick so far ive been impressed with this one and there are no obvious flaws though there are a few minor annoyances on to the good and the bad the good the size and the weight is excellent if youre looking for portability and dont need a lot of computing power im using it exclusively for document formatting and its perfect for that the keyboard feels much nicer than the macbook air theres some give to the keys which was absent on the air making the whole typing experience awkward theres none of that on the asus and it feels good even at cruising speeds over 100wpm the screen is pretty good and gives you full 1080p the bad this is not a performance machine i figured id put that under the good and the bad if youre looking for an allaround machine that allows for more intensive programs like gaming photoshop etc you should look elsewhere no backlight on the keyboard this is a wash for me i know where all the keys are so its more a minor annoyance than a dealbreaker for me but if you hunt and peck then that could definitely be a drawback in dark environments heat when i first set up windows the thing got hot up near the underside by the screen this seems to be isolated to when youre doing something thats resource intensive i dont have the problem when running a word processor for example but see above about this not being a performance machine resource intensive can be defined as setting up windows or installing a program its not terribly uncomfortable but it is an annoying design tradeoff to get rid of the fan the screen has a weird texture to it i checked my computer and a display model and that just seems to be a thing and its difficult to explain its really only noticeable on a white backdrop and appears to be a thing with this model but the odd texturing can be distracting when you notice it the sd card slot doesnt fit an sd card entirely part of the card is always going to be sticking out seems like a size limitation issue but it also makes it difficult to put a card in and forget about it which is possible with larger machines i read some other negative reviews of this before purchasing to see if there were any glaring issues and figured id address problems from other reviews here i picked up a minihdmi to hdmi cable along with my purchase and have no issue i connected it to a 1440p monitor little bigger than standard 1080p and there werent any major issues some people took issue with the way the trackpad works ive had no trouble with it touch gestures work fine i dont bump it with my wrists like on other republic of gamer asus laptops ive owned and its serviceable theres also an option to turn it off and use an external mouse which is nice overall this is a nice machine for the money if youre a pc person who likes the form factor of the macbook air id say this is a reasonable and far cheaper alternative just keep in mind that youre not going to be running anything intense like photoshop gaming etc on this bad boy', u'nice macbook

unusable i called microsoft support and they were ready to charge me 109 dollars for a fricken consutlation the guy was like is there a problem with the price how much do you want to pay i was like no

updated i thought theres gotta be something to that cause when i first bought this thing a few weeks ago it wasnt doing that atleast i then was forced to reset to the original state and try that out and wa fricken la it works again so apparently one of the features of a microsoft update is that your computer downloads the slip in and out wifi every 2 minutes app how friken awesome luckily i only had the thing for a few weeks so didnt lose very much files now when people ask me what type of computer i have i say i have a microsoft pos piece of s so if i must leave you i leave with this a

clean way looks almost unibody there is no extra pieces on the keyboard section except for the nicely layout keyboard and large trackpad the speakers are under the body and engineered into precisely cut matrix of small dots the hedge connecting the screen and the body is also metal and has the same champaigngold color as the outer body it feels tight in a good way the bezel around screen is normal not as thin as the xps has but it absolutely does not look thick one more thin the surface of the laptop does not have that zenbook circle look just a nice onepiece metal with light gold color i like it this way 5050 keyboard the keyboard is good enough for normal typing the key travel is decent it almost feels like a macbook the space between keys are good you dont have the chance to press two keys together or misclick any key however after using it for almost a month i do feel the necessity to have backlit i guess asus need to consider it in the future series another downside for the keyboard is the key feels a little loose thats why i said almost feels like macbook when you press the key you can feel the key shaking around a little and for keys you have to press with your little finger not as strong as your index or thumb you feel it shakes more and harder to press and the keys get oily very soon so you should clean it daily 3950 update after one month use the z key and left tab key feels more flimsy so i start worrying about the longevity of this keyboard trackpad one of the most important parameter for laptopultrabook its not a macbook so dont expect macbook trackpad experience however the trackpad is decent enough for 7001000 range laptop it is very responsive there is no cursor jumping around the scrolling is smooth with the asus gesture center you have access to quite good multigesture two finger for right click three fingers to activate cortana four fingers to call out action center of course zoom inoutrotate i havent used it long enough so i cant say how long it will stay in this way the cons about this trackpad of course is despite it tracks smoothly it is kind hard to precisely move your cursor to the point you want this is due to the lack of good move acceleration mechanism i guess asus didnt want that so it is easier to make the trackpad tracks well first you have to move to some place near your destination and then move to your destination with a slower speed like playing golf another downside with the trackpad is it gets activated easily usually when you are typing your finger can accidently touches the trackpad and your cursor just jumps to somewhere you never expects best thing to do connect a mouse and disable trackpad for long typing session 3850 ergonomics the laptop overall provide good ergonomics good for use on desk lap bed kitchen counter starbucks airport quiet and cool but there are few things that can get annoying sometime first the two plastic stands under the screen that are supposed to elevate the screen side a little and help provide a comfortable angle when you are using the laptop does not work well with the four big plastic feet under the bottom case the height is not adjusted well so one of the big front foot is lifted in air when laptop fully opened the result is your laptop will rotate around one front feet in my case the right one when you put a force on it reallyreally annoying when you are using the trackpad and always accidentally push the laptop forward i have had a replacement from amazon the problem is worse that i can actually feel the tilt when the laptop is opened up i returned the replacement so i think this is a design or quality control issue for this ux305 line not sure for ux303 etc a second problem is the trackpad positionsize i havent used trackpad before had a thinkpad so i am not sure if its a problem with all ultrabook trackpad but using this one i have to put my wrist in an angled position where my wrist is at the table and fingers lifted up to use the trackpad in this way my wrist gets tired within one hour and hurts for longer duration i guess its because the laptop is too small provide extra space under the trackpad so you can rest your wrist on

(u'this is an amazing product this is my second chromebook and an all around beast i am going to break down this review first for people that have already used chromebooks in the past and what makes this model special and then break down why chrome is so awesome to begin with this is the ideal model for me it is by far the cheapest that is out out there and also the best for what i am looking for i started using acer web books with the aspire 1 and absolutely loved having it to not have to lug around a large laptop for when i needed to get online or work on something that didnt need a lot processing power for it stayed my go to for school work or to lug around when i didnt want to carry something heavy then my go to macbook pro died the aspire would not pull the load of such an expensive piece of hardware and i needed a replacement but didnt have the money to get another one i had been reading about chrome and that it replaced programs with online apps i decided to take the plunge and quickly realized that it was an lifestyle to completely convert to google while i will admit that not everything on the google network is completely where it needs to be i will say that being an early adopter that it gets better all the time and is the most complete and the thriftiest of the other options but more on that in a moment in terms of what you are getting from chrome that doesnt really change from platform to platform what you are getting with this version of chrome at least compared to the the acer 710 the first iteration of acer chromebook is a much sturdier frame this is the biggest improvement overall to me and is even much better than the 720 version you are also getting a 216 ghz processor which is a decent size upgrade in processing power though you are still dealing with 2 gb in ram and 16 gb solid state drive i know this is getting a little bit ahead of myself but i have read a lot of reviews and comments about the lack of physical memory on this and how it prevents people from saving files if that is how you feel then you are doing it wrong the idea of chrome is to outsource most of the processes to google so that very little has to run from your unit you get 100 gb cloud drive for free with purchase that can be accessed anywhere i spilled water on my old 710 and thanks to the way that google works as soon as i signed into my new computer not are all my files there and intact but all of my preference and third party passwords saved on my google profile it was just like signing into my old computer only this one runs much faster and has a much better battery life it went from 2 hrs to between 6 and 8 depending on what it is that you are doing another big improvement is the speakers which are still located on the bottom of the computer but dont get as distorted when placed on your lap or cloth surface as the older models still not peak sound performance but much better than before now to the bad this first is a minor gripe that goes on preference but i dont like the keys as much my girlfriend has the same model and prefers them to the 710 but that was an immediate selling point for me they are still the individually placed keys similar to apple but they feel to me as though they are slightly more raised making me lift my fingers ever so slightly more slowing down my typing i wouldnt even really complain as they are much more springy and feel free to go to a store and try it out yourself now for the unforgivable the delete key has been replaced by a power button that is actually part of the keyboard i have no idea why this was important for google as it is a part of all their newer chromebooks but it really has no function as the notebook powers itself on when you open it automatically meaning that i have only used the power button maybe twice and a delete key is just handy for typing and such i guessing they were trying to immolate apple the mouse pad is much less responsive and while better than anything i have found for windows it just has the slightest of delays and feels like it just isnt as tight as the older models it isnt bad if you dont have the previous model which was better than my old apple mouse pad to compare it to the sd card slot no longer completely accepts the card leaving half the card sticking out i have caught cords on similar set ups and broken the sd card off accidentally in the past with my old mac so while this is a feature carried over from the 720 i really wish that they would go back also the 710 had an additional usb port and a monitor hook up i also enjoyed the fact that the old power cord had the option to change the plug out so that you could change for what country you were in this cord is longer though so it is minor if you intend to stay in the us the biggest annoyance for me was the fact that the ram could not be upgraded the acer 13 and 15 so named for the size of their screens both have the option for a 4 gb ram and 32 gb solid state drive one of the purposes for having a smaller laptop is that i dont have to carry bulky equipment and while i dont really feel the lag from the lack of ram now i also know that this model is not going to age as long which is really quite a shame considering how much effort you can tell they put into creating a sturdier frame for the computer that is the best of all the chromebooks it is most infuriating when you think that the older and slower 720 only had 4 gb of ram and it isnt even a choice here my last gripe is the lack of choice in color and i dont really like white though it grows on you now for chrome unlike windows and apple this is not made to run programs this means that if you have to download a program onto your pc this is not for you on the plus side this means that it does not have a heavy operating load and is lightning fast on the internet which is what it was made for now here is where people seem to be betting confused about how this product was intended to be used because i hear a lot of people advise that chromebooks are great for people who only want to check email and social networking on while this is true and if that is all that you do online then this is not only the cheapest and best option to do so there is really nothing that you can do on any computer that can not be done here that does not mean that it can run any program but that google has a work around to do any task if you want to write documents then you are going to have to work on google docs you can still read a word doc or just about any other kind of document the hands down best feature about chrome is that it can open and play just about any format for just about anything without the hassle of updates that you are responsible for but if you are going to write a document you will need to write it on google and have it convert to word or pdf an extra step but what i am quickly realizing is that google word is just all around better not to mention that it is sharable so that many people can be working on it in real time sure skype doesnt work but google hangouts does the same thing i work in media so one of the biggest things for me was video editing there are online editors that work in a cloud so while i have to pay a subscription it is actually much cheaper and i dont have to update models every time a company comes out with something new this is a lifestyle and you really have to realize that if you are going to convert completely to google that there are a couple of old ways of thinking about computers that you are just going to have to let go and come to terms with the fact that this is a faster cheaper and more updated way to use a computer the more people who get on board the better all of these work arounds and apps are going to be and the idea of paying hundreds of dollars every year or couple of years for software is a thing of the past trust me you wont be disappointed', u'this is an amazing product this is my second chromebook and an ',

beast and getting on in years and its constant lagging is a killer my ipad mini while portable and great to use for wasting time on the internet or reading isnt a feasible writing or editing tool and so began my foray into the world of chromebooks long story short taking the plunge with the acer cb3 was one of the best decisions ive made  pros  syncs with your google account which duh its a chromebook  this was perfect for me as i do all of my writingediting in google docs and gmail  though it isnt using the familiar interfaces of windows or osx it was very easy to adapt to the chrome os its a lot closer to windows 7 than anything albeit a very strippeddown version  super fast and strong wifi connection for reference my bedroom is the furthest point from my living room on the other side of the apartment where my router lives and my ipad minis wifi connection is spotty at best in my room it frequently cuts out altogether my chromebooks connection in my room is 100 all the time

tap a button expect the cursor to move dramatically and probably not do what you wanted at all all in all okay for price but invest in a separate mouse if you expect not to be frustrated by normal

it\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4s still about twice as powerful as my dell i3147 but what i was somewhat concerned with the complaints of a loud and below average trackpad and heat issues i\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4ll admit the trackpad is loud and is not incredibly sensitive tapping or twofinger scrolling on windows but after turning edge swipe features off it is easy to use and is not incredibly erratic like other trackpads i\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4ve encountered hopefully with a driver update we will be able to tweak it during the fresh install performed the computer did get warm but not hot on the bottom and top right of the case however based on the actual ability for heat dissipation compared to other core m machines httpwwwanandtechcomshow9117analyzingintelcoremperformance it should not be anything to worry about i think some complaints of the ux305 becoming \\u201a\\xe4\\xf2hot\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4 are caused by using it under heavy use on laps which would impair the heat dissipation from the bottom aluminum panel since there is no fan the bottom and top are the only places for this dissipation to occur there are settings in the advanced power settings menu to change the tdp to low nominal and high so changing it from high to nominal or low would reduce heat but i\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4m unsure the degree of impact it will have on performance the performance of this machine is absolutely fantastic for everyday tasks like writing multitasking between browsers and programs and videos the m5y10 performs perfectly for those a little more keen on numbers i ran peacekeeper benchmark it simulates more of my usage than any other benchmarking tool since i do no gaming or picturevideo editing and the ux305 scored a 2855 in windows and 3457 in ubuntu i ran it along my i3147 with an ssd and ulv pentium quadcore which got a 1303 in windows \\u201a\\xe4\\xec all fresh installs according to the article mentioned above the m5y10 in the ux305 scored much better in most benchmarks than its higher clocked sibling since the zenbook was able to keep cooler and a more consistent turbo than the dell with a 12ghz29ghz core m just for kicks i tested fallout 3 and fallout new vegas 2008  2010 and the gameplay on ultrahigh resolution never stuttered below 30fps and the soc and cpu temps never climbed above 150f while playing on a surface this was similar heat 136140f for watching videos but because of the fanless design i probably wouldnt play demanding games too much to avoid reducing the cpu lifespan  other laptops have fans that kick in and drop the temperature to 120f or so but this will just stay the same throughout intensive use the keyboard is absolutely the best i have ever owned or used there is less travel but the keys are spaced excellently and there is a lot of feedback also i am confident the letters will shows up when the button is pressed \\u201a\\xe4\\xec not something i can say of the last three machines i have used i discovered if the middle of the computer is

with googles ecosystem there are times when im annoyed with chromebooks and miss having windows or os x with the hp stream 11 thats no longer the case because it has a full version of windows 81 bing version and it should be plenty capable of running windows 10 when its released pros  under 200  full version of windows 81  good battery life  nice keyboard  less than 3 pounds  comes with some nice extras  stays pretty cool  fanless and whisper quiet cons  subpar screen quality  single band wifi adapter  cpu is constantly pegged and memory usage high  power adapter could be more compact performance the intel celeron n2840 is no speed demon by any stretch of the imagination and im actually surprised that windows 81 can run at all with 2gb of ram but wouldnt you know it the system is actually pretty peppy if you dont have more than one or two programs open at a time of course if youre running chrome with several tabs youll see things slow down but its totally usable otherwise i can run a browser and word at the same time and get some work done just dont expect miracles i didnt even bother trying to install anything like lightroom or photoshop besides you wont have room on the stream 11s tiny 32gb emmc drive the screen is 116inches with a native resolution of 1366 x 768 it has a matte antiglare coating and is easier to see in sunlight than the glossy screen of the hp chromebook 11 however the stream 11s panel is awful compared to the chromebook 11s ips display the stream 11s display looks washed out at most angles when you find the sweet spot though its decent the stream 11s wifi card by realtek rtl8723be is solid and i never experienced any connection drops im slightly disappointed that a device that relies so much on networked services doesnt support dual bands connectivity  battery the stream 11 comes with two usb ports one usb 20 and one usb 30 a headphone jack sd card reader and a fullsized hdmi port for the size the number of ports is generous it also has stereo speakers that sound about what youd expect from a tiny sub200 laptop it gets loud but theres like no bass plug in some headphones for best results or make use of its bluetooth connectivity and pair some bt speakers to it the battery is rated at 8 hours and 15 minutes its hard to measure exact times but battery life is noticeably better than the chromebook 11 which is rated at 6 hours the ac adapter is kind of big unfortunately i much prefer the chromebook 11s charger which charges over microusb keyboard  trackpad the stream 11s keyboard is 97 fullsized the chromebook 11s keyboard is fullsized yet i found the stream 11s keyboard much easier to type on maybe its the slight layout difference in chromebooks but i type nearly at full speed on the stream 11 while im constantly making mistakes on the chromebook i wrote 90 of this review on the stream 11 the trackpad is a decent size and glides smoothly button presses feel nice and have a suppressed sound to it rather than clicky like the chromebook 11 the best feature of the trackpad is that it doesnt pick up accidental motion when i type on the chromebook i had to turn off tapping because the trackpad was so poor at detecting my palm over my fingers software  miscellaneous the hp stream 11 didnt come with too much crapware in my opinion i did uninstall mcafee livesafe and bonjour but i kept 7zip 920 and office 365 i also got rid of a few desktop shortcuts like dropbox tripadvisor snapfishetc and hps connected services like drive music and photo the included extras are nice including the 25 windows store gift card and the free year of office 365 personal the lid on the stream 11 is hard to open even with two hands i was able to stream pandora and amazon prime movies without any buffering problems since its windows i can create a local user account on the stream 11 and use a shorter password to log in logging in to my chromebook is a pain because i use a very secure password for my google account since chromebooks require the same google password to log in im forced to type in that password every single time conclusion if you set your expectations right the hp stream 11 is an

those unfamiliar with google\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4s quirks i feel that using gmail on line and using google docs for the first few times is similar to upgrading microsoft windows i know what i want to do but doing it is just a little different than the last version i used i have had 6 tabs open in the browser and had no sense of the machine slowing down utube works well the sd slot does not swallow the entire card as a bigger laptop does so i understand how others do not like having the card sticking halfway out of the machine but then i do not roam around with the card in the machine the flash drive worked just like it would on windows i downloaded a pdf file and that was handled well pictures can now be inserted directly into an email instead of sent as an attachment i prefer inserting them directly into the message the initial device configuration hung up but it seemed to be an online glitch so i turned the machine off for 20 seconds and turned it back on and everything was completed right away i registered the chromebook on acer\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4s website and as soon as they accepted the serial number the screen changed and there was a link to download the full 40 page user manual which i highly recommend doing the manual is available on the acer site but i needed to look around for a while to find it before i registered the chromebook the keyboard is 105 inches across just shy of the 11 inch one on my 17\\u201a\\xe4\\xf9 acer laptop and it works well i was using the machine off and on for 2 days and leaving it on standby in between usage i monitored the battery status during that time and i think it did last through about 85 hours of use plus the standby it recharged from 5 to 100 in less than 1 and a half hours this machine has no fan but after hours of use it was still quite cool to touch the speakers are on the bottom but have more than enough volume when it is sitting on a table most people use headphones anyway as they are better than any laptop speakers because i have previously had google accounts when i signed in the first time all of my google bookmarks and everything else google started showing up so that saved a lot of grief with transferring files and such if i completely shut off the chromebook i need to log back into google otherwise from standby that is not necessary i can just use the chromebook as a guest and that does not require any login i have used this thing day and night for the last 5 days and have yet to find anything it will not do well one day i had the chromebook and my windows laptop side by side during an agonizing tech support session with my web hosting company the chromebook had been in use for about 4 hours prior and when i turned the windows laptop on it went through 100 battery in 25 hours but the chromebook was still running fine on its battery and lasted another hour plus one thing i learned from the acer chromebook manual was how to do a right click it is simple just tap the trackpad with two fingers for a quick half second the dialogue box will open with options as it does in windows machines if i hold that too long the chromebook thinks i want to move the screen up or down i cannot speak much for games beyond a card game i play my thinking is get a tablet for playing games they are better with a touch screen you never lose an email with google until you choose to dump it that can be years on just a free 15 gigabyte storage i opened google drive and using it with the chromebook it runs faster than with a windows machine i do not know why but i had quit using it with windows because it took so long to up or download my windows computer takes 2 minutes to come out of sleep mode and be ready to use it takes almost 4 minutes from a shut down this chromebook is ready to work in about 5 seconds that is big for me because i want to jump on line for just a few seconds at times i have been using this chromebook for 1 week now and i have not found anything it will not do i am sure i will at some point but not yet after 1 week i can understand why some people have said when they bought a chromebook as a secondary or backup unit they now use it as the primary computer if you have read this far and know of things windows will do that chromebook will not you apparently use windows for things i never have i think for 90 or more  of users this acer

and is very easy to use by way of some background before the details im a long time apple user as in from the original macintosh to current ive been accused of being an apple fanboy though i like to think im a bit more objective than that i have a great little macbook air as my work computer and my personal home computer is an ipad no complaints whatsoever the college i work for uses google apps ive used gmailgoogel docs personally for a long time and even the two foundations i serve on have google apps environments so when i decided i wanted a lowcost laptop for occasional personal use a chromebook seemed like it would be the perfect solution the first two i was able to use both current models and both more expensive than this acer were awful they felt inexplicably slow for a computer that was primarily running a web browser for an os painfully slow i didnt last a full week with either of them and was disappointed i wanted to like the chromebook solution but those first two experiences almost made me give up then i came across a review of this acer 11 saw all the mostly positive reviews and the very low price and decided to give it another shot this time around it worked beautifully the chromebook itself is nicely made it is plastic and certainly feels less significant than my macbook air the lip formed by the keyboardtrackpad plate where it overlaps the molded bottomsides shell has a tellingly plastic feel to it in particular but despite that first impression it is well made and fitted it doesnt feel flimsy and the screenlid is solid enough that i havent ever worried about it flexing and breaking the keyboard is perfect the keys have just the right amount of travel and sensitivity really they feel almost identical to the macbook air keys the track is also very good though a tad less smooth than the airs even so i havent had any issues using it or switching back and forth between the two laptops for a macbook user this keyboard and trackpad will feel very familiar and comfortable battery life is very solid and i routinely get more time out of it than is promised the screen is bright enough resolution is fine and the matte finish helps with glare it isnt anything as good as a retina caliber display but quite good enough for regular use i also like that the screen can be tipped back until almost parallel with the keyboard this really helps when finding just the right viewing angle especially when moving from sitting to standing the chrome os is the other half of the chromebook equation as others have noted it is an operating system built around googles chrome web browser and their suite of online cloudbased tools you need a googlegmail account to run it so if you dont already have one you will be prompted to create one when you first boot up simply log in with your gmail account and your google apps universe is there waiting for you there is almost nothing to configure and almost nothing to install google apps comes with a very good suite of office apps and they have continued to evolve to a point where they are fullfeatured and very compatible with ms office apps for those who have office 365 you can install word excel powerpoint and use them directly but given the compatibility between google apps and office google apps can now edit ms office files directly id suggest giving them a try before shelling out for office 365 check out the chrome store to see all of the apps extensions and utilities available anything that is webbased is of course just as functional on a chromebook as any other computer which means i can use the icloud beta site to run pages numbers and keynote as well for most folks and especially for personal use the chromebook is a very viable option i really have no complaints

mousepad off as an it guy thats really really annoying so fnfkey it is  the edges are sharp i dont know why bad if your desk is high enough that your wrists need to rest not such an issue if youre using this on your lap though  really sty wifi card works great in the same room horrible and drops frequently if there are any obsticles difficult to replae this as it is located on the top of the motherboard under the keyboard not accessible without taking the entire thing apart  windows 10 is really really bad if you have a lot of not name brand stuff you use with your computer a lot of my bluetooth peripherals dont work on this im not docking points from the product for this note you have downgrade rights all the way to windows 81 or 7  the screen is really mediocre it reproduces colors alright enough and the colors are rich and lovely however who the heck thought putting half1080p resolution into a 156 screen was a good idea everything is huge i set chrome to default 80 zoom so i could use the internet without needing to put the laptop 5 feet away this also makes many things a bit unsharp not supremely blurry but not sharp for example the spotify logos black lines are a bit blurry but the green circle is pretty crisp this just grates on me as i keep using it the contrast looking from different angles really shows the quality of the screen its just really not great for primarily dark scenes  the screen only goes back to about 110 degrees which is just below comfortable while it is propped up on your knees in bed watching netflix small 25 deadzones on bottom and side of the track pad makes me want to break something flimsy screen really freaks me out the good parts its a great deal for day to day light use feels a lot thinner than it looks in the pictures well balanced easy to replace the hard drive after you get through the 10 screws holding in the bottom plate just be very careful as the bottom snaps off so use a small flathead to gently pry  no hard drive activity light thank god who the hell needs that  all of the lights on the laptop are fairly dim or diffuse so they dont blind you at night  its relatively cheap im not afraid of getting it stolen like i would be with a 1200 notebook i did upgrade the license to windows 10 pro since i didnt know prior that was required for hyperv functionality putting an ssd 120gb 70 made this about 5 times better all of the little performance issues i was having went away immediately so much happier with it now bottom line put an ssd in it and you will be happy with this as a web surfing machine

update after traveling for two weeks with the ux305 it performed mainly as expected the trackpad buttons are somewhat clunky so i normally just tap the pad this usually works but i find myself developing a habit of hammering the pad or double tapping just to make sure the click works there were times when a backlit keyboard were missed but it was not a deal breaker video performance was consistent as were individual office applications if this is all you need it will provide acceptable performance the thin light form was a joy to travel with and the adapter worked fine on 120240v

before i wrote a small review for this laptop as i wanted to give the computer some time to break in what i have foundi love it i looked at computers for well over a year no joke to make sure i was buying something that could keep up with my lifestyle and job i am a chemist working on my phd and although i tend not to run any software that is too large on my laptop i use desktops in the lab for that i still needed something with a little power and portability i wanted to keep my price under 1000 so that immediately ruled out apple which is fine i have found that this computer with the same specs cost around 1300 for the mac air which it looks virtually identical too really it does almost 2x the cost dell lenovo hp all had individual issues i was not happy with dell 13 inch was floppy and expensive when looking at the 7000 series lenovo poor reviews for this and last years models and not impressed when handling hp overpriced if you ask me after waiting for sales running out of cash for unseen reasons and messing with every laptop available i finally decided upon asus as the company i was originally waiting for a 15 inch yearold model that was a little bigger but packed an i7 and larger ss hard drive the zenbook was always in the back of my mind but i thought i would need something bigger than a 13 inch screen i got impatient as it had been so long and amazon took a while to restock the 15 inch asus so i just went ahead and purchased this i could not have been happier with my choice a 13 inch laptop is more than big enough for me i dont squint when reading which i thought might be an issue partly due to the awesome screen and it is very portable i actually carry my laptop with me everyday now something i have never done i guess i will touch on each aspect quickly note i am not even close to being techsavy sizematerialweight this is really a perfect sized laptop the material is some sort of aluminum maybe but very scratch resistant and solid feeling a huge plus for me a plastic laptop at this price range was something i wasnt going to consider it is super light and in the sun almost gets a purplish tint very pretty power i have the i5 with 256 sshd and it is more than enough more me the computer boots up in a second and loads everything and completes all tasks quickly the biggest software i run on this laptop would probably be matlab and some chemistry data analysis software all work well i had my heart set on an i7 but after talking to some people who were actually computersavy it seemed that for a dualcore processor there wasnt really going to be a noticeable difference between an i5 and an i7 battery perfect i dont take my charger to lab anymore and just use it in battery saver mode with 50 screen brightness it lasts about 89 hours that way if you are actively running software or searching the web like mad and watching movies it will definitely be decreased but the charger is small and easy to tote screen the screen has a matte finish and at first i had no idea what that mean basically there is no glare the colors are beautiful and the screen is very crisp very hdish i love it negatives the only con to this laptop would be the lack of a backlit keypad i am willing to bet asus will add one to a model shortly down the road maybe they already have final notes you will not find a better laptop than this for the price i will always buy asus from now on and i can see myself coming back to this zenbook should they keep making it lastly pictures will not do this computer justice i looked at the google images as well as the ones

charge your cellphone or other usb connected devices and it works with the pc on or off beautiful almost black aluminum case gives the pc a professional appearance but i plan on not only carrying it in a laptop case but getting a neoprene sleeve for it to protect it from scratches i only say this because the casing has a brushed aluminum circles pattern and if you scratch it its going to be pretty obvious and ruin the aesthetics ive read some off site reviews that said the speakers were not loud enough but simply changing the enhancement settings in the speaker setting area to phantom speakers gave the sound a boost in loudness though i wouldnt call it quality sound the reviewers they may have been let down by the fact that the company lists the sound as having audio by icepower and bang  olufsen technology sounds like a big deal doesnt it  im not a big fan of speaker ports located on the bottom of a laptop but with less than a half of an inch to call a computer they must have had to make choices on what goes where personally i use bluetooth headphones for my listening pleasure the bad not much but the lack of a lighted keyboard may be an issue for those who find that

34 hrs it comes preinstalled with windows 8 which as mentioned boots very quickly i have found that one update seemed to freeze the machine on bootup after downloading the update bootup would show configuring windows features 100 complete and continue showing this for 30 minutes i used the link below to solve the problem which seemed to appear on a lot of asus windows 8 laptops the update that seemed to cause the problem was security update for windows 8 for x64based i solved the problem by doing multiple hard reboots of the laptop

the internet in order to get anything done boy was i wrong  this is a fantastic laptop make no mistake  this compares very favorably with my macbook air the keyboard is very good  nice amount of key

it will last a long time nice sturdy hinges  the screen doesnt wiggle around like i have seen on some of the cheaper laptops battery life is about 89 hours for me with full brightness and doing word processing watching youtube videos etc the other nice thing is that this laptop charges from empty to full in just over one hour  thats pretty amazing here are the apps i use  google docs  do all my writing in this works seamlessly offline and online  just keep typing and it syncs back up when it gets online again never need to save anything  it does it in real time as it goes along safe and

stream 13 first off im not a gamerim surfer and writer also listen to youtube music videos i use various writer softwarescrivener ywriter5 libre etc first thing i noticed with the stream 13 the display has a good colorsbut you need to tilt it just right or it washes out it is very touchy to angles ok up against the hp pavilion sound whats up with the beat audio  the stream kicks it to the curbyes the beat is basser but misses out with the highs and the stream is louder and has more highs which cut through display for a 200 dollar laptop the stream is greati would be embarrassed if i was the pavilion at 550 touch screen who cares who wants to be cleaning your screen all the time and those finger prints would drive me nutsim ok with no touch screen key boardwell i guess the pavilion feels more expensive but 350 dollars morenope lets talk about speed stream 13this thing boots in less then 10 sec and even less to shut down and moving around opening and shutting down programs the stream is faster if they would put a 128256gb sshd in this thing is would be the the best in its class for sure whats a matter hp scared this 229 laptop would out class your other stuff well too late now add a larger hd keep it under 300 and watch your stocks go up most likely the reason its fast is because of the small sshd but i would pay 299 for the stream 13 w256gb sshd ok next

maxed two thumbs down for display and this is the same for the other dell inspiron 11 3000 series audio it is louder then the stream and sounds good speedstill slower then the stream this is not worth 600 compared too the stream 13 dell inspiron 11 3000 series 255 plus tax scratch and dent looks new and says refurbished on back ok i talked about the displayes on these dells already speed is still slower then the stream 13 sound is louder and good but i will have to tell yousince it is only about 30 more then the stream 13 and it has the pent n3530 quad core 4gb ram and a 500 gb hd it is very tempting to take this over the stream 13 ive got a couple more weeks to try both morebefore sending something back the other are going back next week just not worth the 300350 difference over the

paying it is an incredibly good laptop so if you are used to a 156 toshiba satellite with a bigass speaker then you will notice that this bang and olufsen is not quite as loud but the sound was clear if you compare this zenbook to a macbook air you will notice that the zenbook is a relatively high and thickness as compared to the mac which tapers down sharply also if you are used to the sensitive keys of a mac keyboard you will not like the zenbooks keyboard as it misses keys that i know that i pressed i sit here typing on my macbook air so that tells you what i choose in the end overall the

one because of so much fuss about the crapware however as i played with mine i realized i was not having any issues with it i did eliminate the programs i did not need like bonjour and a few others to free up some space i upgraded to windows 10 put in all the updates and added flash player java and firefox i currently have 83 gb of free space and added a 32 gb sd card i want everyone to know you do not have to be techsavvy to have a good running machine so do not be put off by what you may have read in regards to eliminating everything i have all my hp software still on my pc and it works great furthermore i find the hp utility center to be very helpful maybe it does effect the speed but i certainly have not found that to be a problem the only issue i have is with the touch pad which many times requires another touch or two to select an item i can live with that i tried youtube and had no problems viewing the various clips as well as playing a movie from my usb drive bottom line i

i do i didnt want a chromebook since my daughter will want to take this with her places friends grandparents etc where wifi isnt a given so offline use was important then i had an inspiration what about the stream 13 from hp ive heard good things and at under 250 it beats the pants of the surface pro for value unless you need to photo shop or something demanding and its blue well i went ahead and got one and ive found that for what we need it for mostly web browsing netflix watching skype and the occasional flash game with offline capability the hp stream 13 is perfect its small light weight and ive found it to be plenty fast using internet explorer or chrome browser so far ive found the keyboard to have a comfortable enough feel keys arent too small and have enough throw and the trackpad is responsive its usable for productivity tasks if you want it for that the display size is great i think the extra couple of inches was worth it for me bottom line you cant remove the keyboard while doing backflips over a table which is apparently commonly done on microsoft surface devices per the commercials but for a device to do basic work this fits the bill really well and at great value as of dec 2014 you shouldnt pay more than 230 for this version so shop around i got mine from the ms windows store and bonus it came free of all the added bloatware very happy with the

either better than similar competitors or its a better value three means its what id expect no significant complaints but wouldnt go out of my way to use it again the hp stream 13 gets 5 stars from me

other laptops because of ongoing problems such as an unreliable internet connection flimsy and weak design poor screen quality etc the list goes on and on and after a few months of trying other brands like msi lenovo and two new toshiba satellite laptops i was at my wits end as far as what other brands to try out i am a member of several forums and asked for some suggestions as far as other brands to try one of the overwhelming repeated responses i read in the replies was that asus was a very good and solid brand i didnt have much experience in the past with asus but did my research and now i wound up with this laptop you will see that this review is not coming from a verified purchase stamp here on amazoncom that is because i wound up buying this laptop from the microsoft store in the seattle area it was on sale for 599 so i decided to snatch one up the speed battery life portability solid metal body and design and the colorful screen all get five stars the main reasons i returned a very recent toshiba satellite laptop was because you had to view the screen from a very specific angle in order to see a bright screen the moment you were too high or too low the brightness and colors on a toshiba satellite laptop look very faded and washed out for a 1600 laptop i didnt find this acceptable at all this asus zenbook does not have this problem the colors and brightness diminish a bit if you move from side to side but thats negligible compared to when you move your head up and down or if you find yourself slouching or sitting back up i found that to be an annoyance with the toshiba satellite i get nearly ten hours of internet browsing time without the laptop plugged in which is phenomenal i have never had such long batter life with other laptops in fact i never really relied or cared that a laptop could run on its battery alone i just like laptops for their portability but usually kept them plugged in because they typically wouldnt give me much unless connected to an outlet ive also never had a laptop before that had a metal body all the other ones were plastic even though the asus zenbook is made of metal it is incredibly light and its small size fits so easily in my backpack and i cant feel its weight while zipping around town either on foot or while riding my bicycle my prior laptops have been 17 in terms of screen size but downgrading to this 13 size doesnt feel like a compromise the screen really is a joy to look at and reading text is perfectly fine the overall speed is great and i love traveling with this laptop the only reason why i am taking off a star is because i have grown to resent the mouse pad it sometimes makes me jump all over the place while im typing which can really slow me down when im trying to type a bunch of text in fact it has jumped to different areas three times while writing this review im not sure why this is happening but the size of everything on the screen will sometimes shrink or enlarge when i had no intention of doing so i have to click and hold ctrl and  or  in order to fix the nuisance if anyone can provide me with instructions on how to desensitize the mouse pad in order to fix the problem i will happily change my review and give it a five star rating if i have to spend money to buy a wireless mouse i will leave my review with its current four star review spending more money is not a solution as far as im concerned this last part doesnt factor into my review i just wanted to mention it hoping that asus might be listening i think this little gizmo would be even more phenomenal if it had a backlit keyboard i wasnt all that used to the chiclet style keyboard as this model has but it is growing on me all of the prior laptops that i purchased within the last few months all had backlit which is wonderful when typing late at night having this feature eliminates the need for me to turn on any lights this is especially useful when using the laptop in bed other than the mouse pad annoyance i am very happy with my purchase now that i am familiar with the asus brand and what appears to be a solid quality product i look forward to buying more of their products

have stuck with hp', u'great chromebook', (5L, 0L, u'null', 1L, u'Laptop', 673, 16))), (u'H', (u'this is a wonderful example of designing a product for good value every component in this computer is pretty good but no component is the latest technology because the latest technology is generally quit a bit more expensive than the previous technology for only modest improvement in function let those who need the latest technology pay for it while those who do not need the latest will do well to get a product like this which provides earlier but still pretty damn good technology for a really good price the screen is really good although better resolution is available and this screen has noticeably limited viewing angle vertically the processor is i5 not i7 the battery life is adequate indicating that this does not have the latest components with the lowest power usage there are so many ways in which it could be better  but making it better would significantly increase the price and nothing here is shabby its all almost the latest technology this is the choice to make if you dont have a real need for the latest expensive technology', u'great laptop fits my needs', (5L, 0L, u'null', 0L, u'Laptop', 1048, 26))), (u'H', (u'always on a budget and my dell 300 laptop the cheapest i could find years ago loses races to snails on crutches found a one day deal for 125 even that is tight for me and i am thrilled with this chromebook 1 instant boot up 3 seconds most 2 does almost everything i need which is not much just the internet 3 light 4 the battery really last all day beats my dell laptop but anything would cons all quirky why did google do that 1 it really pushes apps like other apps i am tired of trying out 10 or more youtube apps just to find the browser chrome of course works just fine 2 there is a big empty desktop for your background pic but you cants put apps shortcuts or anything on the desktop just the bottom line 3 i prefer firefox in general over chrome  but small price to pay to make the effort to switch to chrome 4 only 1 usb port hmmmm 3 two i think hdmi ports  regular and i think a mini not micro by the power plug  but if you get chromecast for 29 you never need to deal with any hdmi cords at all 4 like the entire current state of clouds and info gathering everthing seemes to get loaded to various places  so if you wanna see racy pics of my dog sleeping on the bed  there are probably a dozen places you could find it i never tried to save any i have no life or info anyone would care about 5 the white looks great but come on  it will get grimy looking in a short while 6 would it be that difficult or costly to have a caps lock key really you can remember on of hundreds of key combos for countless keyboard shortcuts  i dont bother sum forget all my negatives if you are on a budget or for kids it is more than a steal so far  a month or two and btw this appllies to 99 of new electronics  but such a light notebook with a power cord and adapter that probably weighs as much as the laptop itself still  what you gonna do ', u'i had high hopes  and in the end  i was blown away with what such an inexpensive laptop can do love it', (5L, 0L, u'null', 0L, u'Unidentified', 1835, 102))), (u'H', (u'i was very hesitant about buying this laptop for 45000 all i was looking for was a computer that i could travel withemail browse and write at work i use two 27 inch screen computers that can handle anything i knew i didnt want to spend that kind of money so i researched i knew exactly what i was getting when i bought this however the reviews scared me and i had low expectations when the computer arrived infact i had already figured out that i was going to return in no need this computer is great for what i want to dosurf email and write i could not ask for a better computer at the cost i have only had it a few days but it has been wonderful i will download a few apps but other than that it is what it is i am so glad that i bought this i think this computer is for someone who does light computer work it is perfect if you are self employed this computer is perfect for doing your finances as long as you download excel and the programs you need if you are looking for something that is for the corporate world skip this is perfect for a person pleasure computer', u'great personal computer', (5L, 1L, u'null', 0L, u'Windows

saimaDataTuples (u'H', (u'i wont go into the details of what the chromebook is as many reviewers already have done so i live my life in google drive so the lack of onboard applications is not an issue for me almost every application you used to have to install now has a web version  most are free even i purchased my chromebook as a home computer when my imac finally gave up the ghost i couldnt afford to do a full replacement and i needed a computer for home i have it connected to a 24 lcd monitor and my existing sound system via hdmi for the price this chromebook is amazing it does most basic browsing email streaming functions beautifully unfortunately where it chokes is graphics and images im not talking cad  im talking photo rendering graphics intensive websites and even google maps on imagery the poor little processor just isnt designed to handle that much imagery data it even stutters when using its own email inbox app if i could do it id buy a dedicated desktop as my home base and use the chromebook as my mobile computer what i like lightweight affordable compact fast for basic browsing streams videos flawlessly well built quiet comfortable keyboard great touchpad beautiful screen nicely integrated with google and its various applications plays well with peripherals external monitor keyboard trackball what i dont like chokes on graphic intensive processing google earthmaps chokes on google photos caveat  i have nearly 20000 photos in my google drive chokes on photo enhancement again  graphic intensive slow on its own email google inbox  this really irritates me has trouble streaming music and multitasking ive never been a fan of streaming music services anyway i have yet to find one that is consistent and stable it works fine for streaming music by itself but im usually working and doing other things while im listening at my computer and it frequently stutters as the processor overloads you have to be very aware of how many browser tabs you have open 5 or more and you start having issues i know youre saying but the chromebook isnt designed to be a rendering powerhouse i would totally agree with you  except when it comes to googles own applications inbox maps summary  i really think this chromebook is a well thought out welldesigned unit it does what it is designed for very well my concern is that as web pages become more information packed the processing power is going to have to be boosted', u'i love my chromebook   but', (4L, 1L, u'null', 0L, u'Unidentified', 2412, 26)))\
