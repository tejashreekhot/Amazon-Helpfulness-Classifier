[(u'H', (u'i bought this phone because my previous phone would stop receiving text messages from time to time i looked on amazon for a gophone and this is the first that came up looked at the reviews and they said that it does what it is intended to do text call internet i came from an android phone so i am used to pretty much going on the app store and getting anything i wanted because the app store is huge on the android phone i would pretty much call text play minor games snapchat twitter and instagram and check email this phone has the ability to everything that i want it to but somethings are limited snapchat is a thirdparty software that in my opinion sucks compared to the actual but it gets the job done twitter and instagram are great email kinda sucks as well i mostly use gmail and there are apps on the app store but they are third party and i am not comfortable giving my email and password to someone that isnt google or name brand the windows email is not that great i get the email but there are no folders like gmail has such as primary advertisement or even a spam folder it is all just one big folder there is no organizing at all something that was nice on my android phone was that i would only get notification if it was a primary email but with windows i get a notification every time i get an email bottom line of the phone is that it gets the job done and it beats having to go buy a 300 phone from att for 600', u'great phone for the basics', (4L, 1L, u'null', 0L, u'Unidentified', 1432, 26))), (u'H', (u'there as an issue with the software on first

phones as possible and theyre sacrificing inspection and quality control measures otherwise for the average person who waste their money on these expensive phones and never full uses it to its full

pay the apple tax just for the bragging rights to owning an apple iphone however windows phone looked like something id like to use i wasnt wrong i ordered this nokia lumia 635 based on a combination of hardwaresoftware good reviews and price since this was my first outing with a smartphone i didnt want to spend too much and find i didnt really use it for anything else than making calls i was happily surprised when it got it first the nokia didnt feel cheap like some inexpensive phones setup was a breeze and within minutes i was all set up the phone is fast has great call quality and having wifi in addition to 4g lte means around the home i can use my wireless wifi connection to connect to the internet so that i i can reserve my data plan for when im away from home though i havent used the metromodern start page on my windows 81 desktop hated it there i find i really love it on my windows phone and on the tablets ive tried for me its been very intuitive i only had to resort to the users manual a couple of times but the crown jewel of windows phone 81 is cortana the voice assist agent ive used it several times and even with my bastardized texassouth arkansas twang cortana was 100 accurate on every request from local restaurants and movie listings to providing answers on using the phone itself i can tell that cortana and i are going to be best friends before long and this is one phone feature that i wouldnt mind seeing microsoft include on the next version of windows windows 10 next year overall i would have no qualms recommending this phone to fiends and family as long as they are aware of a few things 1 it does not have a rearfacing camera so if youre into posting selfies of yourself youll want to look elsewhere 2 it has only 512mb of internal memory instead of the 1gb more expensive phones have this might be a consideration if you like to run a lot of apps at the same time but so far i havent run into any problems 3 internal storage total is 8gb but that number is reduced by the operating system and apps however this nokia will let you add a microsd card with storage up to an additional 128gb so if you like to carry a lot of music photos or video youll want to invest in one of these cards other than that this is a great starter phone in the windows phone family if youre on the fence as to whether you would like wp over android ios or blackberry or if you dont feel the need for the highend features of more expensive phones as for me im a convert to windows phones', u'love my windows phone', (5L, 0L, u'null', 0L, u'Unidentified', 2591, 21))), (u'H', (u'ive only had this phone for about a day  a half so i may update this review as i learn more about the product so far i like it i dont love it but then its just a phone i still miss one of my old flip phones from many many years ago that ironically cost about the same as this one roughly 150 it had the best reception of any cell ive ever used bar none the camera was excellent considering how long ago it was the phone was extremely durable as well and had i not dropped it just one too many times  dislodged the camera lens id likely still be using it in any case this htc is my first personal smart phone ive previously had an iphone 4  5c for work the 5c was an 8gb model so i find this htc phone to be fairly comparable with one huge difference the screen size ive got small hands but havent had any issues with this monster yet it has taken a bit of getting used to but i find that to be the case with any new item when youre used to something else ive had more trouble getting used to the android way of doing things than with handling the phone itself but again thats just from being completely unfamiliar with the android product line i do look forward to seeing what it can do its a bit less intuitive than apples os but i do have to say that when i first started using the iphone 4 for work i wanted to throw it out a window at least once a day we eventually reached a truce however and im hoping it will be the same with the htc first impressions its big not so big that it wont mostly fit into a pocket but its quite a jump up from a 4 screen im attaching a pic of the two phones for size comparison the htc will definitely stick out lengthwise from a back pocket the ringtone choices are limited  pretty sad but youre able to record your own so i likely will do so as others have said its got 8gb of storage and about half that is taken up by preloaded software that seems pretty standard however and id already planned to pick up an sd card to increase space sooner rather than later thats not an option with the 5c or any iphone so thats a point in this phones favor call clarity is ok but not nearly as good as either iphone its really only about as good as my current vm flip phone which is at least 5 or 6 years old maybe more   when using the htc on speaker however its terrible i use the speaker more often than not when talking on the phone as im usually busy doing things  need my hands so thats one thing im hugely disappointed with i havent explored many apps yet but have not been all that impressed so far with whats included most seem to require you to log into a google account in order to even see what they are and i find that incredibly irritating im not a big fan of google and find them highly invasive in everything they do which is why i avoided purchasing an android phone for so long the app situation seems to be more of the same i do read on my phone a lot so at the very least im going to need an app for that plus i listen to music fairly often so ill have to find something for that as well fingers crossed', u'so far so good', (4L, 1L, u'null', 0L, u'Unidentified', 3049, 14))), (u'H', (u'i love the freedom of unlocked phones when combined specially with tmobile the nexus 6 is hard to beat and for the current price is even a better bargain doesnt have all the bloatware of carrier phones and the software updates come directly from google with not much waiting like you would have to from the carrier software testing the phone performs almost to the level of a note 4 but again the nexus 6 is clean

all this phones 6inch screen glory i can simply not go back to a smaller phone huge yes that is exactly the power of this phone coupled with being a nexus the last thing for which i use a cell phone is making calls i use it for viewing web pages email social applications reading ebooks and documents maps watching movies sometimes a game there is no better experience than doing these tasks in a large glamorous screen as in the nexus 6 sincerely if google launched an ever larger phone say 62 65 inches i would go for it i do not have small hands i have no trouble navigating the phone with one hand obviously one needs a different set of skills for that sorry for the liam neesonline as compared with a smaller phone but it is doable to assist i acquired a protecting case that features a slot for attaching a wristband such that i am not afraid of dropping the phone it fits back pockets of trousers although i try to avoid doing so for fear of forgetting to remove the phone before sitting down no reports of bent nexus 6 however as opposed to the nine bent iphone 6s the phone has toptier specifications albeit not having a 64bit processor the camera takes beautiful pictures for my necessities and the image stabilization helps immensely for a more professional camera control i use lcamera application the phone does run smoothly through all applications i have thrown on it the sound is strong and true stereo with the dual front speakers the fast charger gives a almost 80 charge from near zero in about 1520 minutes i normally use a qi wireless charger for overnight charging this is a nexus phone it signifies you can flash new android versions as they are released before other phones and rooting is a oneclick operation this is also the closest to a pure android os one can get no carrier or manufacturer bloatware i purchased mine in december 2014 there seems to be a problem with a batch of batteries resulting in bloated batteries which caused the back cover of the phone to peel off and sudden shut downs at 30 50 80 battery see the reports here httpsproductforumsgooglecomforumtopicnexusgna3bt6bkacontextplacetopicsearchinnexusbattery

android or ios device but then most of them are ridiculously expensive and this lumia 635 gophone i can just pop in my exisitng sim card and started to use it right away it syncd all my apps and settings automatically it was surprising too no 2year contract to buy phones for the discount price and if i get 2year contract i lose other discount at the end either 2 year contract or not almost it seems i have to pay the full price anyway these days cell phones for 500900 and replace every 23 years and they dont last more than 23 years it doesnt make sense to me to buy highend phones this phone is affordable 50 and very good quality it has limited memory 8gb but adding 32gb sd card and i can run apps from the card easily so internal memory is not a problem unlike other phones ios or android and moving apps to sd card is very easy before windows phone 81 the new ui is nice but it lacked many features but with 81 its great i love wp interface i have both ios and android phones and ipads android tablets i use mac windows and linux as well iphone battery lasts longest and very well built  best quality but way too expensive android device problem is the memory most of apps dont run from sd card so large internal memory is necessary which pushes up the price lumia 635 battery lasts longer than lumia 920 and its very durable and with the cheap casescreen protector i bought on amazonetime 6 for case and screen protector it feels really durable lumia 920 was very nice but it was heavy the metal case was slippery and the battery didnt last long i really really like this phone and im extremely happy with it downsides are  no camera light i rarely used the light anyway so i dont miss it much except the fact that i could use it as a flash light  no sensor for brightness you have to manually adjust the setting its easy to do and not too much hassle though  no compass sensor not an issue for me and gps works fine gps doesnt require compass sensor but some apps may not work that requires compass  no front facing camera i dont take selfies but take photos of my kids so this is not a problem when i purchased lumia 920 about 23 years ago there werent too many apps but now it has tons of great apps and most of essential apps like facebooks linkedin etc are all there and tons of games as well compare to other phones i love these three features app specific  offline map maps can be downloaded and can be used offline very fast and i dont have to worry about the connection or data usage  music app that i can download offline music and listen for free i cant select songs for the free music but its not a problem  i can listen to billbaord chart or classical music collection  radio it has builtin fm radio lumia 530 is even cheaper but smaller screen but its 30 even wo the phone service you can use it as a gps device and emergency 911 call and games music etc update 20150304 ive been using it for a while and here are some updates  i wish the camera has higher resolution but for this price i guess its ok i took many videos and photos of my kids they look fine on facebookweb but its not high resolution that you can print and frame it  i did once needed a flash light but i used the phone screen instead and it was bright enough for me at that time i should look for an app that make the front screen all whitebright to use it as flash light i remember ios has such apps  i dont know if its the phone or career a few times the caller on the other end complained that my voice was choppy  i have ios headset with mic  the mic didnt work with lumia 920 but it works with this phone', u'love it', (5L, 1L, u'null', 4L, u'Unidentified', 3662, 7))), (u'H', (u'i upgraded to this phone from an htc evo 3d last month and i love it one of the best if not the best prepaid phone on the market the price especially here on amazon certainly beats the 600 you would need to shell out for an iphone or samsung galaxy and performance is very comparable at 617 by 31 it took a while to get used the size of this phone it is very close to small tablet territory but still fits in my pocket comfortably below i have broken down this phone into 5 basic categories and included additional details for review of how i graded the phone display audio and camera 5 stars the screen on this phone is remarkable and the camera is better than any ive ever owned including stand alone digital cameras the screen is 55 and only 720p but do you really notice the difference between 720 and 1080 on a small device such as this images are crystal clear and colors are vibrant the touch screen is super responsive and due to the larger size it is much easier to type on this phone compared to my old one the 13 mp rear camera is capable of filming in 1080p which is nice in case you ever want to view your picturesvideos on a larger display like a computer or tv i have not yet used the front facing 5 mp camera but its nice to know its there in case i would ever want to use skype facetime etc the speakers on this phone are really good the boomsound speakers on this phone are the same as the ones on the more expensive htc one m8 they are not the best ive ever heard on a cell phone but they are pretty close and are better than the speakers on some laptops music audio for videos and calls are loud and clear i am very satisfied with the audio and video performance of this phone operating system apps and storage 45 stars the phone comes preloaded with android kit kat htc sense 6 all the normal virgin mobile bloatware and a few other useful third party apps ive found the combination of kit kat and htc sense 6 to be quite user friendly and intuitive i believe the phone will eventually be able to be upgraded to the lollipop release of android as the specs are there for it but whether virgin and htc allow it or not is another story either way the out of box os and user interface is good and should be suitable for new users as well as experienced android users the virgin bloatware is a pain and cannot be uninstalled i guess this is a necessary evil in exchange for affordable quality service as they insist on installing it on pretty much all of their phones some of the preloaded third party apps are quite nice i particularly like the fm radio receiver built into the phone combined with the next radio app which i now use more often than the iheartradio app also i was not a fan of htc blinkfeed at first but now that ive had the phone for a while and taken the time to customize itthis feature it is actually quite useful after all the preinstalled softwareapps you have about 6 of 8 gb of onboard storage left on the phone to add your own apps from the android play store which is by far the largest and most robust of all app stores in my opinion its a good thing the phone can take up to a 128 gb microsd card and more and more developers are allowing their apps to be ported over to sd storage or otherwise i would have issue with only 8 gb of onboard storage another note regarding storage and a nice perk with this phone is a free upgrade to 100 gb of space on google drive physical designfeel of phone 5 stars the phone is big as i mentioned above but at 582 oz it is surprisingly light well balanced and it fits comfortably in my hand the outer shell is a smooth hard plastic very similar to the stuff they use for the samsung galaxy phones the power and volume buttons are on the top left side of the phone i am left handed and love this as they are very easy for me to control with my left thumb while holding the phone in my left hand and talking there is not a physical homemenu button on the phone but there are digital buttons on the bottom touch screen that do the same thing some people have complained about this but i actually dont mind it at all the screen itself is corning gorilla glass 2 and is supposed to be scratch proof overall i think this phone has a great design and feel a lot of expert reviews ive read compare the design to an iphone 5c but larger and running android battery 4 stars speaking of the iphone one of the major issues that i do have with this phone is that like the iphone the battery is embedded and cannot be removed or replaced this scares me and almost stopped me from purchasing this phone so far i am glad i was able to move past it because i really do like this phone otherwise battery life so far has been great and the battery charges back up pretty fast as well so far there have been no issues here hopefully it stays that way since there is no way to replace the battery if it does become a problem this is my lowest scoring category for the phone because of the lack of options if the battery ever does become a problem but so far so good service 5 stars 45 month for unlimited talk text and data need i say more coverage is very good everywhere ive been in the us virgin uses sprints network so you can pretty much get phone service and at least 3g data speeds anywhere this is a 4g lte phone and the speed of data on this band where available is impressively fast my previous phone was 4g wimax which is also fast and lte is noticeably faster to me lastly the phone is on a cdma network so it may not be ideal for international use that being said it does have all the hardware needed to be used on a gsm network so with a little tinkering and some determination im sure it could be unlocked if the need arose i hope anybody thinking about buying this phone finds my review helpful i personally love this phone but i understand all people are

(u'H', (u'this is my 2nd iphone verizon coming from an iphone 5 im an apple enthusiast so this was an obvious choice for me overall the phone is awesome but i not necessarily suggest anyone immediately upgrade from the 55s unless they are compelled to do so it is fast opening and closing apps websites etc but not a huge difference to make me suggest to hurry up and buy it i only got an iphone 6 because my daughter was in need of her first iphone so it made sense to give her my old iphone 5 the screen response is perfect and the thumb print works 90 of the time and is really convenient to get into the phone there are a few shortcomings however 1 the protruding rear camera lens is just stupid  so you really cant set the naked phone on its back without worrying about it 2 the rolled edges on the glass are just stupid  this means that a screen protector cannot go edge to edge it also means that most any case will have a gap between it and the glass at the eye of the case 3 too thin  yes this phone is too thin  hence the protruding rear camera issue thinness also contributes to making the phone very slippery and very easy to drop maybe that is what apple wants  drop the phone often so you have to replace it often 4 confounding the thinness issue are the rounded edges rounded edges make many cases very easy to slip off or at least not fit as snug as they otherwise could 5 not case friendly thin  round edge  rolled glass edges  a very unfriendly phone to accepting cases and screen protectors overall i find the old iphone 55s much easier to fit a case to it and install a screen protector so the iphone 6 is a very cool device for everyday use like email and internet i really do not notice any speed difference but some web pages open slightly faster buy this phone for increased screen size i like the screen size but would probably have bought a smaller normal screen if they made that  the added size does make it a bit less pocketable the 6 seems like it would be too large for most folks  where do you carry it i ended up with the otterbox defender case btw and it seems to work out fine and is very protective and still fits in my back pocket shirt pocket or cargopant pocket i drop my phone a lot so it suits my needs i use it for work play investing and checking stocks pictures video texting notes todo list play guitar with irig music emergency flashlight reading news reading kindle books watching youtube and amazon instant video running apps handsfree phone in car and the list goes on and on what other purchase on the planet enables so many things to be done with it a smart phone is a nobrainer really so at this point i will always have an iphone and my wife and daughter have iphones too just so convenient on so many levels and essential to stay in touch in a busy lifestyle pictures do seem crisper with this phone you cant go wrong with this device period but that does not mean it is perfect  the physical deficiencies i have noted imho are a step backwards for this device performance aside the protruding camera really by todays standards and by apples design theme of sleekness is just stupid and very

(u'H', (u'i am an avid amazon person i have been a prime member for years my family purchases products from amazon frequently and we have multiple kindles in our home in short we love amazon i really wanted to love the amazon fire phone my husband checked it out at att and came home and told me he was sure that i would love it i went the very next day to obtain the fire at first i was giddy the phone was a decent size and felt sturdy in my hands the screen was vibrant and crisp  and boy that dynamic view was incredible i showed it to everyone  even if they werent interested the first few days were spent learning about my new awesome phone sure there were some apps i wanted that werent available transitioning from a nokia lumia windows 8 phone which i loved and previously had the ole iphone 4 strangely there were no emoticons available for text messaging an elementary feature these days wouldnt you think the auto scroll feature was a bit iffy at times way too fast most of the time but to be fair i didnt bother trying to figure out if i could slow it down through some setting somewhere the camera is ok  nothing to write home about after having had the nokia lumia 1020  but it is fine i was used to being able to click anywhere on the screen to snap a photo so it would have taken a little bit to get used to having to click the button at the bottom of the screen instead where the heck is the back button oh there is none you have to swipe up to go back well ok then so far the battery life has been my biggest concern because its horrendous and i have had to keep it on a charger pretty much most of the time flicking the phone to either side to bring up either the menu left or additional information right worked pretty flawlessly for me watching videos and listening to music was great i loved being able to drag and drop from my pc to phone without having to sync it with a program it paired effortlessly via bluetooth to my vehicle although it would not automatically play my music when turning on my vehicle when my previous phone did  and that became an irritation for me and wireless headphones the firefly feature was pretty neat too but i dont really see the need to use that very often i think i could pretty much live with the flaws i had noticed so farno smart phone has it all right then after a few days of playing with and learning my new awesome phone i realized the battery life wasnt getting any better i had erroneously assumed that my using the phone so much was the culprit in the dismal battery life unfortunately that wasnt the case once i had my phone set up the way i wanted and was using it normally the battery continued to rapidly lose its charge and take an extremely long time to charge back up now overnight when i was sleeping and the room was dark  it charged fine when i woke up it was at 100 an hour and half later it was sitting at about 55 you could literally watch it tick down percent by percent i wasnt actively using it i may check my email quickly or hope on facebook for 5 mins but then set it down well  we cant keep our phones on a charger all day can we exactly one week after getting my beautiful new fire i went back to att thinking that i have just gotten a defective phone it just wont hold a charge at all they told me if you just turn off the dynamic view feature the battery will hold the charge much better well  that is the biggest feature of this new fancy phone  right the feature that is bringing in the crowds i thought about it for about 5 seconds and said no thanks coupled with my other observations just no sorry amazon maybe in a few years when youve worked out some kinks and upgraded that battery i might give it another try', u'i had high hopes for the fire', (3L, 0L, u'null', 0L, u'32 GB', 3699,

whatever but i think its pretty darn good especially for the price because virgin mobile charges 100 bucks more on their website i was close to gettin the s3 because i was already familiar with the galaxies and liked them but most of the specs were better on this phone so i figured it cant be that bad some people may say the screen quality isnt top notch but i find it to be just fine not a big noticeable difference in my opinion its the first phone ive had that i couldnt remove the battery so im still nervous to see what happens if it freezes its definitely not a phone you would want to use

this phone aims to be bigger and better than the already awesome nexus 5 this time motorola has decided to give it a shot to make this pure android experience so lets see if this year they nailed googles new flagship phone  design the nexus 6 is big when i say big i mean really big the only phone that comes close to being the size of this phone is the iphone 6 plus this phone is almost the borderline of what determines the difference between a phone and a tablet motorola is really stretching the size with this phone the phone is a lot more rounded and curvaceous from last years model but i feel like it was made this way to make gripping such a big phone a lot easier i do like the design of the device especially the metal bezels which give it a premium feel the keys are not mushy and give a good tactile feedback  sound the phone utilizes stereo front facing speakers which make a bigger sound than phones with bottom or back speakers it is very reminiscent to htcs boom sound speakers overall the sound is better than the average cell phone but still has a long way to go in terms of sound  display the quad hd amoled display is brilliant and crisp i love the color reproduction the blacks are nice and overall it is a very good screen it is an eye candy to look at along with the material design of the new lollipop ui  processing power android lollipop is smooth and flows really well with this phone with my old nexus sometimes there are hickups with lollipop but thats not the problem here games run smoothly with awesome frame rates there isnt much to say except that it is one of the best performing phones of 2014  battery despite such a large battery on this phone battery life is average and not the best on the phone im figuring that the quad hd screen and the processor does take a huge portion of the battery overall depending on how much i used it it ranged from 610 hours but then again i am a heavy user  camera the camera is a lot better than last years nexus 5 though i thought the nexus 5 had a decent camera this phone can also shoot in 4k if you are into that however the camera isnt mind blowing in any way it is good but if you are looking for a great cell phone camera you are better off with the note 4 or iphone 6 plus  conclusion the nexus 6 is a great upgrade to the nexus 5 motorola did an amazing job at making the next generation of pure google android phones if you are looking for a stock android phone with an amazing processing powerand your hands can actually handle this phone than the nexus 6 might be for you',

in my opinion amazon really struck out with their initial foray into the smartphone market for what its worth i am fully baked into the amazon ecosystem i own a kindle fire hdx kindle paperwhite and a fire tv i subscribe to amazon prime use amazons cloud drive to save photos and subscribe to amazon music where i imported my digital music collection for cloud based storage and now i am the owner of a new fire phone so this review is from someone who has intertwined himself with amazons services and technology while each amazon device kindle fire kindle paperwhite and fire tv has its unique quirks and technical limitations compared to their competitors i have been very please with all of my hardware purchases from amazon  until now granted i have not used my new fire phone long but it didnt take long to realize it is not ready to be my everyday companion there seems to still be bugs in the system and the fire phones user interface built on fire os 35 is clunky at best a piecemealed afterthought at worst and regarding the hardware why is no one talking about how warm the back of the phone gets after just a few minutes of general use regardless if i am playing around with the firefly feature listening to music or using an app the fire phone gets physically hot to the point that it is very concerning is anyone else noticing their fire phone getting hot under normal use and the craziest part was the unreliability of the firefly feature to correctly identify products see my attached customer pictures to get a quick glimpse of what my fire phone couldnt recognize like a fire tv box and a kindle hdx origami cover package how in the world does firefly not recognize a fire tv package while i believe the future may be bright for the fire phone i am not sure if being an early adopter and locking into a longterm wireless contract with att is worth the incremental benefits and shortlived cool factor of owning it the phone overheating during normal use is also a big concern especially since the battery is not removable i love my other amazon devices but the fire phone not only leaves me with a sense of wanting it leaves me with a sense of regret  detailed review below   hardware  the fire phone is powered by a 22 ghz quadcore qualcomm snapdragon 800 cpu and adreno 330 gpu with 2gb of ram thats nothing to laugh at but also nothing to write home about either it has a 47 315 ppi display which is large enough to use comfortably without feeling like youre holding a phablet the fire phone has a really nice 13 mp rearfacing camera with image stabilization thats capable of recording 1080p high resolution videos too and the frontfacing 21 mp camera is more than adequate for skype calling or taking the occasional shameless selfie while none of the hardware specifications and performance blow me out of the water they also dont seem to command the price point set for the fire phone or make some new customers willing to switch cell phones on performance alone for what its worth my last phone was a samsung galaxy s4 running android 442 kit kat im not going to belabor the technical specifications and differences of the fire phone compared to its competitive set like the apple iphone 5s samsung galaxy s5 and htc one however i will focus on the differentiating aspects of the fire phone touted by amazon as game changing features that set the fire phone apart and justify its high price tag those are dynamic perspective gestures firefly and mayday  dynamic perspective  dynamic perspective is the fire phones parlor trick to get people saying ooh and ahh while amazon adds another toy to their lineup to pull customers further into their ecosystem at the time of writing this review i am realizing that there are only a handful of apps and games that take full advantage of the dynamic perspective feature essentially the coolest thing i can do with dynamic perspective is watch the home screen play with the icons and status bar use the map application and play a few games where the feature wasnt a complete afterthought amazon may provide great incentives for developers to create new games or recode current games to take advantage of dynamic perspective but that has yet to be seen personally i would love to play angry birds cut the rope subway surfer temple run etc with dynamic perspective but until the development community makes a collective effort to join amazon in making dynamic perspective the next big thing in gaming the likelihood of this technology quickly catching on in mainstream is slim also to save you battery and for when you get bored with the 3d effects there is a setting in the phone that allows a user to turn off the dynamic perspective i keep mine turned on for now but can understand why someone would want to keep it turned off to conserve the battery or to keep the quirky peek feature from flashing hidden items on and off  gestures  along with dynamic perspective head tracking the fire phone offers onehanded usability features through wrist flicks and tilting gestures however i am finding the learning curve to be steep and many inconsistencies with making gestures work many times i would have to over exaggerate when flicking my wrist or tilting the phone to get the desired response on the screen but other times when i was using my natural motion the phone processed it as a gesture and presented actions on the screen nothing critical but just a buggy annoyance it is highly likely that this will be fixedfine tuned with the next software release  firefly  to test the firefly feature i lined up 15 products for the fire phone to recognize and take me to the amazon product detail page of the ten items i tried to scan firefly only recognized 3 of them correctly i kept getting an error message saying the server was unavailable or the product couldnt be recognized the fire phone couldnt even recognize the box that my fire tv came in see the picture i uploaded with this review built on a9s flow application amazon really missed the boat in getting firefly absolutely perfect the small ticket grocery items that firefly did recognized didnt seem conducive to impulse buying like the bigger ticket consumer electronic products that it didnt correctly recognize and i am more inclined to want to comparison shop with firefly at a big box electronics store versus the grocery store  mayday  one thing that i miss while using the fire phone is having an electronic assistant in my pocket like ioss siri or androids google now amazon is missing that accurate personal assistant that answers your questions reminds you about appointments and keeps you productive by predicting what you need before you need it ala google now amazons voice assistant is rudimentary in my opinion as it can mainly do basic tasks like make phone calls send text messages send emails and search the web the mayday feature is nice for the initial setup and first few days while learning how to use your new phone but i cant see a huge need for it after the initial learning curve granted the few times i have used the mayday button on the fire phone or my kindle fire hdx the customer service rep was fast to respond polite and gave excellent service however i have had my fire hdx for months and have only used it three times now if amazon could fix att specific issues through the mayday feature this feature may be worth its weight in gold  whats missing   an full function digital assistant like siri google now s voice etc  google play market although some apps and games may be side loaded if you want  removable battery i have a feeling the 1st generation of fire phones will have battery issues due to how warm the phone gets during continuous use  bluetooth 40 useful in connecting to latest generation wearables  external storage  microsd card slot  multimic noise cancellation trust me this is important for all cell phones  infrared  dlna connectivity nice to have but not critical  the bottom line  in my opinion the customer who would get the most value out of the fire phone is someone who  does not already own a kindle fire tablet  is not already an amazon prime subscriber 1 year free is a nice purchase bonus  at a point in their wireless contract that they want to upgrade their phone dont break your contract for this phone  doesnt mind being tied to att for wireless coverage  not technically savvy and would benefit from the mayday feature longterm  owns or plans to buy a fire tv so that the fire phone can act as a second screen  takes a ton of photos with your cellphone and would benefit from free cloud storage  likes shiny new toys regardless of the practical functionality i accept that being an early adopter for consumer electronics also means i play the role of a public beta tester to prove concept demand and functionality as such i dont want to explicitly discourage anyone from trying the fire phone as it can only get better with updates and future releases but i cant recommend the fire phone as it is right now unfortunately there are too many competitor products that are a better value for the price and features and i am seriously concerned with how warm the phone gets and the unreliability of firefly to recognize products overall the fire phone gets 2 out of 5 stars from me', u'the fire phone is really hot and i dont mean in a good way', (2L,

test run the phone was great however it suffered from poor battery life and the screen resolution was off to me  im a techhead the average person would find it the screen fine i use my phone at work and the battery life was a deal breaker so i returned it if there was an aftermarket battery i would go back now more about the studio 6 hd i brought it here on amazon under the assumption it was new it was not now i have purchased numerous android phones and they allways come needing to be setup not this phone it was used someone had set the phone up and simply deleted the account information the phone booted directly to the home screen not the setup mood i blame this on the seller for misrepresenting the item i purchased a new phone and should have gotten one i went ahead and entered my account information to see how the phone would work i had to reboot the phone twice to get the google play store to load now it loads without a problem as i mentioned the screen is great the phone has a lot of great features the battery life is excellent i went 8 hours normal phone usage at work also facebooking and playing games and only used 40 of the battery however it is not a finished product

been able to updated the phone to kitkat that i can not blame on the seller with all the above being said i like the phone however i do not like being lied to or taking advantage of the seller misrepresented the item and he should fix it with question and without hesitation i will keep you potential buyers posted update i returned the original phone back to amazon without any issues it was a painless experience my replacement phone arrived in the correct condition i had to sign into the phone as if i was the first owner which sometime is not true the phone bootedup without any issues i was able to sign right into the google play store however i am convinced the gps issue is inherit to this phones model the new phone found my location without any issue when a attempted to navigate with the phone the app crashed the gps will now work with other programs but they crash as well or show inaccurate locations its really disappointing because the phone performs so well in other areas the battery is great the portable hotspot camera internet google now and my other apps work flawlessly if the gps worked on this phone i would give it five stars with that said i will change my

and they run smooth cons can take awhile to get used to the size cant get 4g after talking to att because i didnt buy it through them front facing camera is lacking take the size into account doesnt fit easily into pockets default messaging app is garbage cant send mms had to hit the app store for a better one it came with ads imessage is better sometimes crashes long load up but if you keep it charged its not an issue pricey not sure if its worth the pricetag buying it without an upgrade all in all im pretty happy with it after switching from apple if you have the money id say its worth it

upgrade from my 4s when the fire phone price was lowered to 1 i figured  well im going to give it a try i have 2 weeks to return it  so far im on day 10 and this phone is getter better i know there are some concerns  so i will address them battery life yes for the first 3 days the better life sucks but i think it just needed to be woke up let the battery completely die then recharge it give it about 2 times this way as of now i can go all day and ended up at 6pm with 23 battery still and this is with consistent usage of email texting bluetooth connection to my car about 24 hours everyday since i travel a lot for work streaming music downloading new music from amazon prime candy crush saga and obviously talking on the phone so my conclusion is  the battery gets better after a few warm up dont get too freak out  app store obviously not as many apps available as the apple or android store the only thing the held me back from keeping my fire phone was the lack of a good check registry book which i cant live without they have several but i found them not very good however after days of searching i finally found one call cashflow and its better than the previous app i used on my iphone so since that problem is now solved i am now a happy camper many popular games are available similar to what i had on my iphone there are ms office apps a lot of financial institution but not amex  that is disappointing and handful of other things if you are curious search on amazon website for fire phone app  thats what i did to make sure that they had an app for my bank otherwise i would have never bought it at all it is probably good to note that  no they dont work with google play stuff however i dont use google play so im not impacted by it user interface holy easy took a bit to get use to as i am so familiar with the ios but i love the ability to function completely onehanded 9999 of the time i love the scrolling feature where the pages scroll as you tile your phone the swipe up back motion and the tilting left and right function built in in many apps many people say they find themselves stuck in many apps with no back button  that is because to go back you swipe up from a little below the screen took me a bit to get used to  and i think this should have been a part of the intro video but now that i figure it out this is pretty awesome i do have some recommendation  the left tilted screen that have preset menu apps games web etc should be customizable a preview of the text or facebook message when the screen is locked like that an iphone had would be great too music and prime music app should be combined somehow its annoying also the feature that give me lyrics to song only work on songs in the music app not prime music app  very disappointing but these are just easy software upgrade so i am hoping to see an upgrade that address these issues soon mayday amazon get an a for customer service the first day when i purchased this phone i tried to connect to mayday but i was not able to  the phone appear to have had a bad reception and could not connect to my wifi once the connection to mayday got disconnected seconds later i received a phone call directly from the same amazon rep that i was speaking to she mentioned that during the seconds that we were connected through to mayday program she noted that i had the old os and that it needed to be upgraded this was at 10pm in the evening btw all other mayday calls i placed were answered within 5 seconds and all my problems have been resolved with no issues firefly it works but mostly with barcode rather than the product itself i am being optimistic and hoping that they are upgrading their system to make this even better ive used amazon app on my iphone to identify products and prices on regular basis anyway this is pretty much the same the ability to recognize phone number and email is pretty handy tho especially when im in the car passing by an ads dynamic perspective its pretty cool  but useless to me my little sister love it and there are some apps with built in dynamic perspective so thats pretty cool the app icons are 3d as well not just the lock screen what i am really missing voice control is too basic  but i think i read somewhere that an upgrade is coming id love to have cortana on this phone  shes much better than siri plus you cant use voice control while your phone is locked  so that take away the ability to quickly access something right now the voice control only allow you to make call send messages send emails and search the web a bit too basic for a smartphone released in 2014 i really hope amazon address this very soon along with my other recommendation above conclusion give it a chance for 99cent i think this is a very solid phone and that it will get much better and can become a fierce competitor for the iphone 6 and the samsung galexy s5 however until several of the concerns that i pointed out is addressed amazon wont be able to increase the phone price above 99cent but once it is addressed i would happily pay 200 for this phone instead of 400 for an iphone with similar specs', u'solid but can use some upgrades give it a

a very fitting description it is fast has a great screen enough juice to get most users through the day and enough style to satisfy design the 816 is designed much in the same vein as the one m7 and m8 htcs flagship phones but lacks the metal to make it truly premium plastic is used here but in a unoffensive way the body is two pieces shiny plastic on the back and matte plastic around the rim and on the front the slim profile and iconic front facing boomsound speakers cause the 816 to look quite good many users myself included slap a case on their phone so the thickness and build materials may become less important for some the size of the phone will be the deciding factor not buying this phone because of this is completely fair it is without a doubt a phablet however for me the extra real estate was worth it the large screen impressed me i was wary of purchasing a phone with a 55 inch 720p screen 267ppi because most flagship phones boast higher resolutions but i am quite impressed with this display the lower pixel density will not be noticeable unless you hold it side by side with a much nicer screen i found it to be just as nice as using an iphone 5 display despite the iphone having a ppi of 326 features the average consumer will find nothing lacking here the 816 has all of the features one could want panorama and hdr camera setting nfc great speakers 4g lte blinkfeed a micro sd slot as well as much more if one is more tech savvy there are plenty of options for customization as well htc does a grat job of not over saturating the android experience as samsung does while providing enough features not included in stock android the cameras on the 816 contain some of its best features the rear facing 130 mp shooter provides enough detail for most situations as always low light shots are less than ideal they end up being either noisy of too dark for the price however this beats other photos ive seen on comparable phones hands down the front facing camera is certainly sufficient at 5 mp all of the features such as hdr work quite well it was also great of htc to include the option to use the volume rocker to snap pictures since the phones size can be unwieldy at times for snapping pics performance simply put this performs like a flagship phone dont expect to wait while switching between apps or opening the camera etc there is little to no lag while browsing the internet or scrolling between home screens the only place a little lag was present was in snapping pictures which was sometimes slower than on a true flagship such as the iphone 5s the big screen makes the 816 beg to have games played on it most games can run perfectly well there are several youtube videos showcasing this with games such as dead trigger 2 battery performance is sufficient this is possibly the least impressive aspect of the 816 but not an aspect which should degrade from the overall rating it should last a full day with moderate use if you need to watch netflix all day with the screen at 100 brightness which is quite bright you may need to invest in an external battery for my needs the battery has done the job all in all i am more than content with

only reasons why i had to really change phones from ip3s to ip4s was because the battery was dying and the ip3s couldnt quite keep up with the ios updates its as if the updates were slowly making the phone more obsolete and draining its battery well that is exactly what was going on with my iphone4s i could barely keep a charge on it for more than 4 hours it would die at the most inconvenient times and i was frustrated with the new phone pricing plans from all three carriers that i would consider att tmobile and verizon who wants to lease a phone these days and at crazy data plan prices it just made me sick with the whole idea of having to have a cell phone what i really wanted was the samsung note 4 i always wanted a note phone i knew that i didnt want another iphonethey just dont seem revolutionary anymore i was bored with the ios and with the same old phone style never i thought i would get a windows phone i mean i didnt even care for microsoft products period until i got a touch screen laptop lenovo yoga2 with windows 8 i really enjoyed all the features of having a laptop capable of being so much moremore than any kind of apple laptop could be at this time and i do like apple productsbut lately i am just yawning when i walk into an apple store using windows on the laptop made me look into the lumia windows phones i was definitely curious if i didnt have to pay exorbitant prices for the top of the line lumia i would have purchased a lumia 1520 however the perfect opportunity presented itself over christmas when the lumia 635 no contract phone was selling for under 60 it had most of the features i wanted and honestly has not left me sad or unsatisfied for ditching my iphone4s what i really love about the lumia 635 1 no contract on att i actually reduced my monthly expense and increased my data plan at the same time 2 my battery lasts more than 24 hours more with less usage i do use it for a lot of texting checking emails making appointments and reminders taking care of banking stuff wake up alarm surfing the web for news and facebook and to listen to music in addition to phone calls 3 it works as a personal hotspot great feature when there are no free wifi spots and i need to do work on my laptop it is seamless 4 less than 60 that is it no leasing no additional fees 5 easy to switch from iphone 4s i simply put in my sim card from the iphone 4s and i was ready to make calls 6 if the battery begins to die i can buy a new one and replace it myself 7 if i need more storage space the 8 gb is expandable to 128 gb comes with 15gb of onedrive microsofts version of apples icloud 8 very sturdy and simple yet handsome enough phone 9 if i am about 20 left of battery life the phone goes into saver mode where it will allow texts and phone calls to get through in order to extend that 20 of battery life until you can recharge 10 when recharging it does a nice quick job it seemed like my iphone 4s had to wait overnight to fully recharge the lumia 635 recharges in about 15 hours 11 has speed dial and you can quickly add a contact to your screen tiles to instantly calltext 12 has free pedometer and diet tracker just as cool as the weight watchers points app but free to help you keep healthy heres what i really like about the lumia 635 1 its a bigger screen than the iphone 4s so i can read things better 2 its very customizable personalize your

bluetooth system 6 easily integrates with my windows laptop 7 good speaker sound quality  im tired of being forced to buy new products when i am not ready to buy them the iphone 4s with its draining battery and more and more demanding ios updates simply just left the phone useless i hated it i wanted to smash it to pieces everytime the damn battery died within hours of just charging it without having to lease a new iphone i was pleasantly surprised by the amazing lumia 635 and how quick it is beautiful windows 81 is and despite not having everything that i was used to with my iphone 4s i am still happier with this less than 60 brand new phone that helped me reduce my monthly phone bill  what is missing from the lumia 635 that i used on my iphone 4s 1 frontfacing camera yes i was getting caught up in the selfies before selfies even became selfies its nice to have a break from that actually 2 flash the lumia 635 does not have flash for pictures i actually liked using my iphone 4s as a backup flashlight cant do that with the lumia 635 3 some apps that are in the apple store are not at the windows store its a shame really because this is the biggest gripe i have read over and over about people even thinking about switching to a windows phone for me ive assimilated and found other ways to access what i need on the windows phone not too much of a loss really 4 i thought my iphone 3s took better pictures than the iphone 4s although the picture quality got worse through an ios upgrade the lumia 635 picture quality is not that amazing especially when flash would be handy this

let\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4s get down to what matters right specs specs and more specs plus what\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4s new and why we should even think about upgrading from our iphone 5s 1 size the dimensions and weight of course matter unless you don\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4t mind carrying around a brick the size of trailer the iphone 6 comes in at 544 x 264 x 027 inches  weighing in at 455 oz which of course is a bit larger than my 5s this should help out some of us with slightly larger hands but still have a nice grip and feel for all around daily use ease of navigation and just general accessibility 2 retina hd display having shatter proof glass is definitely necessary unless you plan on keeping your iphone 6 in the retail box never holding it and making phone calls on speaker phone for the rest of your life yes it\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4s upgraded from my old 5s retina display to the retina hd display so why is it better you ask with a retina hd display you better know the screen is delivering higher contrast and way better color accuracy which all plays out as just an all around incredible display not to mention a bigger screen at 47\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4 vs my iphone 5\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4s 40\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4 and higher resolution compared to the 5s with the 750 x1334 750p resolution and a 1400 contrast ratio another added feature that is pretty slick is the dualdomain pixels for wider viewing angles so when i\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4m showing my friend something i don\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4t have to have to reach out and aim my phone directly in front of their face 3 nfc support now apparently we will only be able to use nfc capabilities with apple pay for now which allows me to make touchless payments in stores and stuff which i think is incredibly cool and futuristic now i know some will complain as to why all the capabilities aren\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4t functional and no one truly knows except for apple but apparently the particular nfc chip has more capabilities beyond just apple pay apparently at an apple event the watch unlocked a hotel room so i guess these are just some of the possibilities that this particular nfc chipset holds so even though i have to wait a bit to use the nfc fully i\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4m sure the wait will be well worth it in the long run 4 speed using the apple a8 chipset and a dual core 14 ghz cyclone compared to the iphone 5\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4s 13 ghz we\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4re getting a speed boost to keep up with multitasking and if you\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4re like me constantly on your phone working gaming and texting and have 100 apps open at the same time then you know how much speed is a factor since it\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4s using the a8 chipset this literally allows for 50 increased performance for graphics and 25 faster processing 5 battery the new battery on iphone 6 is 50 more efficient though i haven\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4t run it through extreme testing as of yet i\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4m already noticing a difference right out of the box and playing with it for a few hours 6 camera the new isight camera is upgraded using a 8mp camera at 15\\xac\\xb5 pixels and 22 aperture although it doesn\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4t come with optical image stabilization like the plus does it\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4s still definitely worth the upgrades that are provided on the 47\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4 a few others feature\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4s worth mentioning support for 3rdparty keyboards \\u201a\\xe4\\xec this is elaborated on below so check out the rest of my review under quicktype keyboards improved face detection on isight camera  which recognizes faces incredibly faster while improving smile and blink detecting for overall better photos of you and with friends i haven\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4t had a chance to take it with a group to test it yet but at least it\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4s got this cool feature either way improved hdr photos and videos \\u201a\\xe4\\xec the few new photos i\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4ve already taken have a noticeable difference compared to my 5s i put them side by side to test and if i can notice the difference at a quick glance then i\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4m happy with the upgrade and improvements improved video recording at 1080p  60 fps \\u201a\\xe4\\xec doing slomo is kind of funny just for messing around i\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4ve only tested one video with our cat on his \\u201a\\xe4\\xfacatnip\\u201a\\xe4\\xf9 running around the house and rolling around on the floor and it definitely gave us a good laugh the real thing i\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4m interested in but haven\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4t tested yet is the timelapse video being able to catch a sunset or moon rising within a few seconds on video is probably one of the coolest features for editing later or just making fun videos cloud photo backup pricing varies \\u201a\\xe4\\xec i get up to 5gb free which is more than enough for me with photos and a few videos i want to keep around for a bit if i ever need to upgrade the pricing below gets me more space on the backup 20 gb 99 cents per month 200 gb 399 per month 500 gb  999 per month 1 tb  1999 per month beyond all the specs of the 6 there\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4s always that question\\u201a\\xe4\\xb6 \\u201a\\xe4\\xfawhy do i use an iphone  performance on the iphone has always been a major factor the ios system consistency offers stellar performance and rarely ever experiences major performance issues now with the ios 8 update that happened on 917 which is expanding features and finally giving us more functionality some of these key features are a nice addition to my daily use messages the fact i can now easily share my location with my girl or friends when we want to meet up somewhere is sweet plus it giving me the ability to add a video instantly to my messages makes this a super cool feature sharing with family now i can share the stuff i\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4ve purchased from itunes or even the app store with family some of the app\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4s i\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4ve paid for are relatively expensive and when my brother likes one of the apps instead of him having to buy it i can just share it with him i think this is pretty generous on apples part allowing me use this with my fam interactive notifications which is now allowing us to swipe our imessage or text message notifications to open them quickly and reply instantly back now i don\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4t have to open or leave the app which was kind of annoying at times i want things on the go and on the fly and i\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4m glad this new feature was added quicktype keyboard even though the ios 8 update improved the keyboard functionality it is now allowing for 3rd party keyboards to be used the word prediction is also another nice update which should help us out with the darn autocorrect problems though the update has fixed most of the autocorrect problems it\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4s still better having more options than none adding extensions this is something that definitely helps me keep things going when i need to check for updates on the fly the widgets and extensions aren\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4t limited anymore since the ios 8 update has now expanded to online services they will sit only in the notification center but this helps with unnecessary battery drain and extra mess on my screen photo editing i can now edit and or update my photos directly from camera roll once i\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4ve snapped a picture instead of having to enter into vsco cam that used to annoy me because i wanted to just snap a photo edit it and send it quickly now with this new feature it\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4s finally possible and makes life easier if you\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4re a \\u201a\\xe4\\xfafood picture\\u201a\\xe4\\xf9 taking freak like me the continuity feature this is something i\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4m seriously looking forward to basically the integration with my mac or tablet will allow me to answer phone calls on either or even answer text instead of having to pick up my iphone from what i hear i can literally swipe documents from my phone or ipad directly to a computer or vice versa my mac is connected to my tv so if i can literally swipe my netflix app onto my mac which is connected to the tv while i\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4m on the couch then this function is seriously freaking cool in a long story short i love my iphone 6 and with the ease of use literally being able to do everything with one hand the iphones durability and with the hugest assortment of apps on the market i don\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4t really have any complaints as of now besides some small ones that are going to get fixed anyway even if i do have an issue their grade a customer service is always there to help me out as quickly as they can overall\\u201a\\xe4\\xb6 with my new iphone 6 and the update to the ios 8 it\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4s a serious upgrade and with the ios system in general you know it\\u201a\\xe4\\xf4s going to be stable

windows phone os i personally love it but it certainly isnt for everyone if you are not familiar with windows phone you should probably watch a video that goes over its interface and such before purchasing a windows phone device to see if its right for you a great article that does this can be found on windows phone central httpwwwwpcentralcomwindowsphone81review my review primarily discusses the hardware as opposed to the os this phone is effectively the new lumia 520 released last year it is extremely inexpensive but has numerous improvements over the 520 from last year the major improvements are the processor the wireless radio and the screen with the updated snapdragon 400 the lumia 635 is smoother and more responsive than the 520 besides the occasional loading screen on heavier apps which i tend to blame on the 512 mb of ram i would say it runs as older flagships like the lumia 920 it runs games very smoothly such as wordament the greatest game ever haha this speediness is augmented by the fact that the 635 has lte capabilities making it probably the least expensive phone that has att lte if your phone doesnt support lte or you dont live in an area that has it then you may not appreciate this but here in the greater denver area atts lte is impressive it makes pulling up web pages and updating content in apps much snappier than just standard hspa speeds the 520 offered the screen is also beautiful for a budget device while not hd what do you expect for 100 it does have the latest gorilla glass 3 for great scratch resistance it also has nokias clearblack display meaning that the screen basically has an extra polarized layer to improve visibility regardless of the lighting situation it makes for easier viewing in sunlight it also makes the colors much richer and blacks much deeper than the 520 which had fairly washed out colors of course there are some downers with the new phone we lose the twostage physical camera button which is a real pity that is something that i feel all phones should have but alas it still only has 512 mb of ram this isnt a dealbreaker for casual smartphone users but if you are a heavy smartphone gamer you shouldnt buy this phone or any other budget phone for that matter some apps have a 1gb minimum requirement which this phone does not fulfill but almost all of them are games there still is no front facing camera i dont care about this but some people do the rear camera isnt that great either there are a few sensors also lost on this phone like the proximity and ambient light sensors overall you will likely not notice a super difference with the proximity sensor as they work around that well the missing ambient light sensor can be a downer at times but with the new action center in windows phone 81 you can easily toggle between three preset brightness settings the medium one works for most situations pros 1 super responsive despite budget specs 2 microsd for tons of expandability 3 super inexpensive 4 lte speeds 5 clearblack display with gorilla glass 3 is very nice for a budget phone cons 1 camera is pretty bad plus it doesnt have flash 2 no front facing camera 3 lost the hardware camera button 4 occasional loading screens on heavy apps 5 some apps require 1gb of ram and will not install some games all in all the phone isnt spectacular but you arent paying for a spectacular phone are you this phone has great specs for the price but due to the price you are going to have some features cut you simply need to evaluate if this device would fit in with your usage habits if you are a heavy smartphone gamer or have a selfie fetish you obviously wont want this phone if you are a casual smartphone user that likes phones that function well but dont require you to

wifi use on your network as well as the other features of the phone i would give it 5 stars however i am yet to get the phone to work on a metro pcstmobile cell network i went to the local metro pcs store and puchased a new gms sim and they initially activated it they were able to get it to interface with the metro pcs  tmobile network in my area that is for an hour after that there were no bars and no service so i contacted metro pcs main office and they tried to reactivate the phone to no avail  and suggested that i revisit my local metro pcs store so before doing that i contacted blu the manufacturer of the phone in miami and their suggestion was to do a hard boot of the phone you have to hold down both the volume and onoff buttons at the same time and hold it until you get to a bios sort of menu where erasing cashe and hard booting are options i did that and no improvement so this afternoon i plan to revisit my local metro pcs store if that doesnt work i may have to switch carriers to get the phone to work properly so if this is the case i feel justified in taking off two stars for false advertising of metro pcs as a working carrier if i get this issue resolved i will revisit this review and provide additional information if the issue is a defective phone or if the fix works by metro pcs then i will revisit the star rating i have given ive never been so frustrated with a phone as i am here update so i met with the manager of a corporate metro pcs store who had lots of knowledge about this product so the blu studio 60 hd has two sim slots however the technician that installed my metro pcstmobile sim yesterday plugged it into gsm slot 2 thinking that slot 1 was just for cdma dont do that  slot 1 is actually a gsm or cdma slot slot 1 can be used either for gsm or cdma make sure that the gsm sim is placed into that slot first otherwise you will lose your network the next time you turn it on and it will not come back  even if it was first activated that way fill slot 1 up first before placing another sim if you choose to do so with another carrier in slot 2 the manual and documentation from blu is really bad on this for the reason of such frustration the phone gave me initially and no documentation to clear things up i was tempted to only add back one star  but i cant this is a terrific phone the whole staff at metro pcs were gawking over this phone and one tech told me that she like the blu more than other pricier phones that they sell you can read about the many features and benefits of this phone from other reviewers however i will mention

the time to explore it and learn a few things you can do alot more then you ever could do on ios some of the simpler things i like is the ability to easily take a screenshot on your phone and being able to hide the app icons you dont use ill try to keep this rundown short 1 build  design the phone is huge but you get used to it i promise it feels sturdy even those its plastic the back is a huge fingerprint magnet so i suggest putting it in a case you will not find one in a store i had to search amazon and found a cheap one from china took forever to get but it was actually fantastic even has a kickstand 2 speakers two rows of front facing speakers best in sound quality ive ever heard from a phone 3 calls and data its hard to discern if a phone handles call quality better then another because your network signal plays the biggest role i will say vs my old iphone 5s on the same service in areas with the same signal strength ive had less dropped calls and clearer call quality with this phone as for data the iphone would sometimes pick up lte and the speeds were great im not sure if the desire is enabled to do so ive only noticed 3g videos and gifs will suffer while on the go but nothing too horrible 4 screen ill never go back to smaller screens again it may not be true hd but its so close you dont even notice most the time since i got this i havent even touched my ipad mini 5 battery better then my iphone but hard to judge some days it seems like it drains super fast but it could be me just losing track of time because its so hard to put down 6 camera the only thing i dont like is the camera all my indoor pictures come out blurry tweaking the settings doesnt seem to help much either i was surprised because it has a 13 megapixel camera and alot of reviews say its a good camera may just be my unit shakey hands poor lighting or a combination of all its a real bummer because i love knowing i have a camera with me incase something noteworthy happens but so far its dissapointing it takes a while to snap a picture too and if the subject is in motion forget about it 7 apps the htc comes with a nifty set up program that can connect wirelessly to your old phone to grab contacts and such which is great theres a program that goes along with your computer also to help load up music and stuff coming from itunes it wasnt as easy to get everything up and running especially getting my itunes library onto the micro sd card i eventually just got fed up and tried copying and pasting it onto my card and luckily my computer picked up on it and automatically changed the file types for me the google play store is great lots of free deals i got a linkin park album the 1st lord of the rings movie and a bunch of old books completely free the amount of apps for anything you could ever wish to do is mind blowing compared to apples app store a word of warning though it seems like anyone can develop an app on google and you get the feeling like some may not be safe i had downloaded a highly rated virus scanner and after an hour my phone got super hot and the battery died just be careful and if something seems off about a certain app uninstall it to be on the safe side conclusion its a great phone great price i use virgin mobile because i hate contracts and their pricing and if i want to upgrade my phone i pay upfront for it but its still a better deal then how the contract companies work their plans to get the money back for those discounted prices if tommorow i saw a phone i wanted i can order it and put it on my plan easily no strings attached

characteristic of this kind of device you cant turn a phone into a tablet the good beautiful bright screen the ppi isnt as high as other highend phones but the 1280 x 720 720p screen looks good very good even theres some minor very minor darkening distortion along the top edge but its almost never noticeable fast and responsive apps and navigating are breeze on this thing compared to my old acer iconia a200 more on that below this is no comparison sure youd like to have 2 gb of ram instead of 1 and the 4 gb onboard storage is frankly a little weak but overall the hardware has more than enough juice no bloatware comes with a bare bones stock install of android kitkat 442 which is great this is a beautiful device for ereading battery life is excellent for a screen this big youll easily get 710 hours of hard use on a single charge on days with only minor use you can easily go 72 hours between charges granted by the end of day 3 im under 10 remaining but still the cons as stated you cant turn a phone into a tablet even when you and the manufacturer really really want to this is a phablet pure and simple granted its still small enough to fit into a typical front pocket in a pair of jeans but its still a large mobile device im tall with big hands and im usually fine using it with one hand as a phone but for anything else two hands is needed dont get me wrong i really enjoy using this phone the overall experience is great the problem is the blu studio 6 is both too big and not big enough at the same time a little background my wife goes through about a phone every 2 years she drops them cracks the screen etc this past year she got her upgrade but i was using an old android 22 phone and an aging android 40 acer iconia tablet for my portable tech well during an exercise run on the treadmill i ended up knocking the tablet off and cracking the screen kaput so at that point i had the choicedo i get a new tablet or kill two birds with one stone and get a phablet one of the reasons id gotten a tablet in the first place was to read pdfs the problem was my old iconia a200 was just toodangslow to render pdfs of any size or complexity but i also really wanted a new phone i looked at and considered the galaxy s5 galaxy mega huawei ascend mate2 and the blu studio 6 i was this close to purchasing the ascend mate2 until my wife wandered by and said for that price you can get both the blu studio 6 and a kindle fire so why not do that instead so i went ahead and ordered the blu studio 6 thinking that maybe just maybe it would do the job on its own and i wouldnt have to even order the separate tablet sadly as cool as the studio 6 is and truly it is a very very cool phone its juuuuuuust not quite big enough to surf the web and read pdfs clearly like it would be on a 9 or 10 inch tablet     yet its too large to be a really comfortable as a phone a great device stuck in no mans land if you dont care about reading pdfs this phone jumps up to at least 45 stars that said surfing the web feels     strange somehow on a small screen you just accept the fact that you have to workaround the device limitations this phone feels like you should get a more full bodied web surfing experience but the size limitations are just enough to make you yearn for an extra 152 inches of screen real estate granted surfing pages is fast and responsive but the screen real estate just isnt quite there to really make it a treat hopefully if nothing else ive helped someone else out there decide if this is the right device for them', u'great hardware great value love the screen but',

hadhad this phone coming right out of the box had an enormous impression size wise enterthats what she said joke 1 and i thought my s4 was big lol the user interface that htc has very clean its taking some time to get used to but its nothing bad or difficult just different the screen resolution is on par with me no visible pixels plenty bright and very good color the build quality is top notch very nice design and material one flaw though as stated many times before in reviews the back its glossy and a fingerprint magnet very annoying i suggest buying a case good luck very mediocre selection the

the best phone you can buy almost a steal on amazon one more gripe side button location what the hell was htc smoking when they decided to put the power and volume buttons on the left side of the phone because of the size of the phone even with my big hands the reach convenience is killed i will have to deal with it i guess have fun if you have small hands battery life for the size is pretty damn decent gets me through all day with average use just hope it lasts me the phone is unibody which means you cant open up the phone and or change the battery when it comes to the camera its one of

with the old phone the turbo charger that comes with it is very fast it gives you about 6 hours of use after only 15 minutes or so and a full charge in about 2 hours much faster than my old phone note i am not a power user at all if most of your life revolves around your phone your mileage may vary i decided to get the unlocked version to eliminate a lot of the bloatware that att and i suspect the other carriers load on the phone when you buy it from them it comes with almost every google app already installed and it is easy to get the apps you want to transfer from the old phone installed on

without me even touching the side button and everytime i go to plug it into my car it starts talking and will stop playing music really stupid sad situation has been a horrible experience for me in my

but no otterbox support and all the available knockoff ones for this phone look cheap and i prefer to keep the premium look and feel of the phone with a slim case also i recommend you slap on a tempered glass screen protector as well that combo makes the phone looks super classy high end the power button although in an unusual place top left is easy to get used to and the normal placement on other phone now feels a bit weird to me its all muscle memory but that and the volume rocker are quite wobbly and lack that reassuring click response on most other phones like my old moto g but not a big deal the screen is big not too big just right this is my first phablet and i really dont see myself ever going back to a regular size phone 55 at 720p hd looks fantastic not the sharpest but more than sharp enough and colors look a bit washed out not as vibrant when put side by side to the moto g but a great looking screen nonetheless this uses the same cpu chipset as the moto g but its clocked faster 16ghz vs 12 and has more ram 15gb vs 1gb and honestly it makes a huge difference unlike the moto g and pretty much all phones with 1gb or less with that extra ram you can have several apps in the background and open them up right back up without them having to reload and the higher clock speed means the screen feels much more responsive apps open and close much faster and scrolling on the web or on facebook is much more smooth the only lag ive noticed with general use is sometimes swiping through homescreens can feel sluggish not sure why even with no apps running and blinkfeed turned off maybe its just my device but not a big deal the gpu that comes with the chipset isnt the best graphics intensive games are playable but i wouldnt call it smooth but casual games candy crush temple run etc run fine all and all performance wise gaming is basically what youd expect for the price but general use is dare i say almost comparable to flagship phones ive messed with real smooth the cameras are flagship worthy no doubt about it my moto g had a 5 megapixel primary camera the front camera on this phone is 5 megapixels and the back matches some flagships at 13 mp sure mp count isnt everything its the quality of the sensor but htc didnt slouch pictures taken outside in good light blow away any other phone in this price range low light shots are exceptional as well no other 300 off contract phone can touch this phones camera quality if youre a spec person and have looked into this phone youve probably seen that nfc is only on certain models this model does have nfc very good to see it also runs on 4g lte if youre used to a 3g only phone the data speeds crazy fast no more youtube buffering its night and day saving the best feature for last as a music lover the front facing boomsound speakers are ridiculous at half volume its loud enough for a room and at full volume it fills my friends apartment and its not just loud its clear not tinny in the least bit like every other phone out there with a single speaker its produces a full sound and it actually has some bass to it no need for an external bluetooth speaker and theres two speakers so its stereo hold it in landscape while watching a music video or movie and you get that full left to right sound experience pair that with the big nice screen and the media experience is just amazing all in all this a a fantastic phone and even better is the price you get fast smooth performance on a big great looking screen cameras near worthy of a flagship and htcs trademark front facing boomsound speakers all for about 180 on amazon no doubt the best phone virgin mobile offers thats not 600 and a really great phone in general no dont get the lg volt the kyocera dont get the cheaper htc desire 510 cousin has it

perfect very comfortable to use no complaints about that 2 display 5 stars one the best bright  vivid display on a smart phone there is no slider to adjust brightness only 3 settings toggles low medium  high i mostly keep it on medium sometimes on low but never on high you can set those 3 levels on settings menu because its too bright p very very good color production id say about the level of amoled panels and you can also tweak display colors 3 battery life 6 out of 5 stars you do not have to worry about battery life trust me my settings are like this gps wifi mobile data on 247 and i always get more than a day easily with moderate to high usage it is because lack of higher resolution proximity sensor  aided by the os itself 4 camera 5mp back camera quality is too good for a sub 50 phone you can compare it with the camera of iphone 4 im serious it is that good it does not have a front facing camera meaning you have to take selfie blindly have to video chat on skype blindly with the back camera  5 call quality call quality of nokia phones are legendary no rating needed 6 removable back cover means you can always swap a new color for 7  get a new look those covers are sturdy  good looking 7 expandable storage supports upto 128gb of micro sd card you can move apps to sd card  free the phone memory too 8 os windows phone 81 is great its fluid smooth  a pleasure to use all

from nokia this app is unbeatable you can use this phone as a gps navigatior which is much more smarter than a garmin or tomtom device yes you can use it as a sub 50 gps device health  fitness by msn an excellent fitness tracker steps counter  much more a very very good fitness app i couldnt find a better or more reliable fitness app on android windows phone 10 preview yes you can install  experience the new wp 10 preview on this phone its officially supported  will be upgraded to wp 10 camera really great 5mp may sounds low quality performance but this can capture some very detailed photos there are some scanner apps on store you install one of those eg handy scanner  use it as a document scanner multimedia device even if you dont use this as a phone you can use it as a mp3 player or a very good video player fm radio which is a very rare thing this days in a smartphone  it works perfect conclusion can you suggest me a device which can play music movies browse web which can be used as an offline without internet navigation device  on top of that can make phone calls and all these under 50 answer is very simple  short no if i use other android phone as my daily driver i use this phone as a gps navigator it works sooo good  the long lasting battery is always a plus in the end i highly recommend this phone as a daily driver or as a secondary phone or as gps navigation device or as a multimedia device like an ipod  updated 05142015 since im not selling this phone anytime soon i bought a rounded edge tempered glass screen protector received it today it is
