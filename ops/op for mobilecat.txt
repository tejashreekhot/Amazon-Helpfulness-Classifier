[(u'H', (u'three months in and i love this phone still wonderful mayday feature was very helpful today dismayed by the poor reviews i went back to look at the positive onesto make sure i wasnt delusional there i came across the solution to the one thing i perceived as a problem paying 200 for it before amazon dropped the price to 99 cents dont you hate it when that happens one reviewer disclosed that someone answering the mayday call would refund the difference well sure enough they did thats why amazon is my favorite retailer of all time and thats why im their best advertiser telling all the people i know about my continued great experiences with them thanks jeff i never cease to be amazed by this phone besides the ease of use for normal tasks with superb voice recognition its features make is so much more than a phone its a handheld computer that can make phone calls i use it as my kindle reader out on my porch while streaming music all with the wifi setting its the first phone that makes it relatively easy to surf the web just hold the home button and ask this is my first smart phone so i am enthralled there seems to be a free app for everything one might like to do also if there is a question about anything pressing the  will get you live help within 15 seconds a friendly englishspeaking rep walks you through the process in question taking command of your phone to show you how if need be all this without making you feel like an idiot for asking this is the first fire phone to be marketed so features will be added its so cute when asked to play james taylor it says im sorry i cant do that yet updates to existing software will increase the already impressive capabilities battery life allows 68 hours of constant use which i think is pretty good and charging takes 2 hours under normal use battery would last most of a day at least oh almost forgot about firefly amazingly ids any song movie tv show or product code in seconds so cool and of course amazon tells you where to buy it dynamic perspective is a bit of fun with fascinating new screen savers every day also allows to see under certain menu items havent tried it for gaming camera is great

about a year left on my iphone contract no big deal i waited to see what the reviews looked like a few months along once upon a time i sold cell phones one thing that you learn is that it is difficult to judge a new phone in the first 2448 hours give it a few weeks and you will find all of the bugs and annoyances so thanks to everyone who took the plunge before me this is a standard and so far very reliable smart phone i like the camera option that allows you to pick the best lighting for pictures its almost like cheating the year of free prime almost makes it all worth it i already got the case with free shipping at a third of the price from att protip phone cases wholesale around 36 its also the right size my old phones did not have a big enough display but i didnt want a phone that might as well be a tablet i already have a kindle the weekday and weekend alarm option is a nice little feature the firefly feature seems to work fine on qr codes but it will also look at an item to see if it is available on amazon to nitpick i wish the books app would give you separate options to view the books stored on the device and the ones that only live in the cloud the phone is designed to push you toward buying stuff from amazon but thats not surprising since it is an amazon product and all the biggest knock on the phone seems to be that the navigation is not intuitive i translate that to mean it doesnt work just like an iphone if you have a kindle fire this works very similarly you just have to play around with it a little bit use this for a few months and suddenly the iphone navigation is not intuitive in fact the att sales rep was not ready to sell me the fire until i explained that i also have a kindle and i read all of the reviews its funny how i didnt get the same reaction when i changed from the samsung to the iphone in the end this is a solid phone that doesnt offer anything new but ultimately we have already created a device that puts the hitchhikers guide

access to common functions really well thought out the built in flash light option available when i swipe down is thoughtful the unique kindle feature that this phone can read out loud my daily newspaper subscription to me is awesome and super handy when im in the car or eating breakfast since this kindle phone is a real kindle it can read almost any book out loud as well even if professional narration is not available this is a killer feature and works really really well the amazon wallet app stores all of my loyalty cards such as my starbucks card to pay when i get coffee and even my local library card and automatically generates barcodes and qr codes as needed its great i also noticed that battery life is much better than on my old phone one of the most pleasant surprises are the stereo speakers they sound great on top and bottom btw the voice recognition on the kindle fire phone is amazing it works well and even recognized my wifes unusual name and spelled

additional comments i had read that this phone has gps problems and the solution was to set it to a higher level by using cell towers and wireless for positioning references i mount my phone to the windshield good access to the sky and have and no problems with normal gps tracking via satellite only its actually been very good and better than my s2 was something else i had concerned about was using a mini usb to charge it thinking i would have problems getting it inserted i did have problems i figured out it had nothing to do with the phone and was strictly a problem with the included case i cut out the screen sidefacing piece with scissors which was blocking the usb cable connector and keeping it from seating properly the case still holds snug to the phone but doesnt block the usb charging port now and every usb cable works same thing with the headset port case was obstructing it ramblings will blu bold like us release lollipop for it im thinking they will because this phone is pretty popular and i suspect sales will be strong for some time plus its a good time to win some fan support while they have a popular product and ummm why do people answer questions people ask with

its very simplistic and its only 226 this is phone is a bargain ive compared this to lg g3 lg pro 2 galaxy mega galaxy note 3 and the huawei ascend mate2 asides from the huawei ascend mate2 this phone cost half or less than half of the brand name phablets the huawei cost 300 btw  also a very good phone now of course this phone is no where as nearly as powerful or sharp graphics wise as the brand name phones ive mentioned but those phones cost 400700 and comes loaded with bloatware plus unless you play a lot of graphics intense games you really dont need a phone with pixels above 720 x 1280  which is what this phone is btw 1 star reviews and issues now as to those unfavorable reviews regarding the phones inability to access the google playstore i did not experience that issue blu must have did a software update i did not experience any issues with the phone whatsoever however the phone doesnt run the latest version of android out the box it comes as android 422 or jellybean this can be easily remedied by doing a software update go to settings  about device  wireless update you will notice a difference as the phone does run smoother with the latest version of android 442 android kit kat processing speed and graphics are similar to if i had to compare this to another phone i would say its kind of like the galaxy note 2 i have a galaxy note 2 and it runs about the same graphics wise and speed wise of course this phone has a 5 inch bigger display comes factory unlocked doesnt have all the preinstalled samsung bloatware and it doesnt have a stylus personally im glad it doesnt come with a stylus i never use it whats in the box case headphones cable plug phone check this out this unboxing on youtube httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv2ndzfktp4b0 4g or 4g lte this phone runs off hsdpa so its not true lte its more like 35g and up but depending on where you are hsdpa can run 4g speeds comparable to lte so yes this phone is 4gish but not lte specs this is a quadcore phone it runs off 13 ghz cortexa7 graphics 720 x 1280 pixels 60 inches 245 ppi pixel density memory 4 gb rom 1 gb ram it is bluetooth enabled and can pick up fm radio stations as well go to gsmarenacom for the full specs heres the link httpwwwgsmarenacomblustudio60hd6330php gsmarena doesnt list 4g on the spec sheet but it is 4g capable overall i got this because 1 price 2 factory unlocked 3 bloatware free i have ocd when it comes to clutter including digital clutter 4 6 screen size 5 simplistic 6 i wanted to take a chance on a smaller company vs the samsungs and apple now this phoine may not be for you if youre looking for something powerful and sophisticated it doesnt come with a heart rate monitor fingerprint reader ir beam etc this wont be the best phone to run the latest intense games videos or apps but if youre like me and you just need a good large screen phone to run emails facebook twitter instagram music or even to read while on the treadmill then this phone will do just fine alternate

of my small iphone and didnt want to shell out a ton of money for the iphone 6 because it seems like every new iphone is only slightly better then the last it had been years since ive had an adroid phone and i wasnt sure if id like the os turns out i love it if you take the time to explore it and learn a few things you can do alot more then you ever could do on ios some of the simpler things i like is the ability to easily take a screenshot on your phone and being able to hide the app icons you dont use ill try to keep this rundown short 1 build  design the phone is huge but you get used to it i promise it feels sturdy even those its plastic the back is a huge fingerprint magnet so i suggest putting it in a case you will not find one in a store i had to search amazon and found a cheap one from china took forever to get but it was actually fantastic even has a kickstand 2 speakers two rows of front facing speakers best in sound quality ive ever heard from a phone 3 calls and data its hard to discern if a phone handles call quality better then another because your network signal plays the biggest role i will say vs my old iphone 5s on the same service in areas with the same signal strength ive had less dropped calls and clearer call quality with this phone as for data the iphone would sometimes pick up lte and the speeds were great im not sure if the desire is enabled to do so ive only noticed 3g videos and gifs will suffer while on the go but nothing too horrible 4 screen ill never go back to smaller screens again it may not be true hd but its so close you dont even notice most the time since i got this i havent even touched my ipad mini 5 battery better then my iphone but hard to judge some days it seems like it drains super fast but it could be me just losing track of time because its so hard to put down 6 camera the only thing i dont like is the camera all my indoor pictures come out blurry tweaking the settings doesnt seem to help much either i was surprised because it has a 13 megapixel camera and alot of reviews say its a good camera may just be my unit shakey hands poor lighting or a combination of all its a real bummer because i love knowing i have a camera with me incase something noteworthy happens but so far its dissapointing it takes a while to snap a picture too and if the subject is in motion forget about it 7 apps the htc comes with a nifty set up program that can connect wirelessly to your old phone to grab contacts and such which is great theres a program that goes along with your computer also to help load up music and stuff coming from itunes it wasnt as easy to get everything up and running especially getting my itunes library onto the micro sd card i eventually just got fed up and tried copying and pasting it onto my card and luckily my computer picked up on it and automatically changed the file types for me the google play store is great lots of free deals i got a linkin park album the 1st lord of the rings movie and a bunch of old books completely free the amount of apps for anything you could ever wish to do is mind blowing compared to apples app store a word of warning though it seems like anyone can develop an app on google and you get the feeling like some may not be safe i had downloaded a highly rated virus scanner and after an hour my phone got super hot and the battery died just be careful and if something seems off about a certain app uninstall it to be on the safe side conclusion its a great phone great price i use virgin mobile because i hate contracts and their pricing and if i want to upgrade my phone i pay upfront for it but its still a better deal then how the contract companies work their plans to get the money back for those discounted prices if tommorow i saw a phone i wanted i can order it and put it on my plan easily no strings attached sure it works off sprint towers and my signal usually never meets verizon or att levels but its good enough for me',

vice city which was a disappointment for me but i found a way to get the game to launch simply by having my facebook messenger chat icons always on top when the icon was on top of the game the game always loaded and played well too it did actually run most apps smoothly tho so i cant complain much and i have plenty of apps other than that the photos are comparable to my s5 without a noticeable difference in quality the camera is simply awesome on this phone everything on this phone is top notch and should please any user it was definitely a better value than the s5 as my s5 only has it beat in ruggedness water resistance gps accuracy and the ability to play my game i paid 250 more nearly the price of this phone for it tho last and still of great importance when it came time to replace my charge cable i realized that the industry standard for micro usb devices has too short of a male end the female receptacle on this phone is deeper than most and you need to find a compatible male

if there was already someones account on there but there was not while i was in settings i tried adding my main google account i added it got my email but when i went back into settings it kept giving me sync errors when i checked the account status and all my credentials were good obviously because i initially got my mail i went to the play store to download my usual apps it wouldnt connect i went into the builtin app list and opened up the google settings app to see what information i could get from there while i was in there i planned on activating the android feature where you can find your phones location online if you happen to lose it even with my gpslocation turned on in settings it wouldnt let me activate the phonefinding feature because google location services are not available in your region or something like that which is odd because every other android device i have allows it here in the us my only thought is that this was shipped with an os version that is based out of a banned country that would explain none of my google services working or syncing no app store access location service access no google server access to hangouts or any other such apps it was just very disappointing because the phone itself was beautiful the screen was absolutely gorgeous except for the fact that i couldnt load any apps or services to it i did a factory reset and set it up fresh still didnt work i did all the usual things like clearing the google play services and google play store data and caches but still nothing tried it with other google accounts nothing set up a new account from the phone nothing im hoping my experience was just a fluke and im choosing to exchange rather than refund but until i get a unit that works with google services which is the whole point of an android phone i just cant recommend this to anyone also worth noting any time you complain about an issue with a blu phone on social media or sites like this theyll say contact us at such and such email address but when you actually mail that address no one typically responds hopefully my replacement works correctly when it arrives and hopefully it arrives not powered on and past the setup screen this time but until then its just 1 star from me update it should be noted that blu has issued an update that fixes the outofthebox problems that prevented any google services to sync or any apps to be downloaded so that right there bumps the review up a by a couple stars the device itself feels very much like a galaxy mega in the hand in build quality and size and the screen is mostly beautiful mostly the viewing angles arent the best and when you get too far off center the colors really cool out towards the blue end of the spectrum but most people dont look at their phone from the side so thats not a deal breaker the battery life is okay but nothing to brag about the first couple days it was stellar but now that its been through a few dischargerecharge cycles it has simply turned into a fairly average battery i can mostly make it through a busy workday and not have to plug in for juice until late evening overall its been a mostly pleasant experience now that blu has sorted out the initial connection issues in the original build of the os i would definitely recommend this to anyone that understands the limitations theyre buying into', u'hopefully my experience is

with this phone in most ways but i have to add a caveat the 8 gb internal memory is getting to be very limiting i did a factory reset on my phone let the os and all the preinstalled apps update we do have android 502 now and when it was done they took up over 6 gb that doesnt leave a whole lot of room for other apps htc has added to the load of bloatware with many apps which i dont need are redundant or where i prefer another app for the purpose google also installs its full suite of apps many of which i dont use and of course you cant remove any of these or move them to the sdcard im still not sorry i bought the phone but i cant really recommend it to new purchasers at this point the way things are going you wont have any room for personal apps before long virgin has also

course in general the phone works well with supported applications if you like amazon services then this is the phone for you if you rely on any of the google services then this is not the phone for you gmail is supported very well but google wallet isnt supported nor is google drive it would be very nice if amazon would loosen up the restrictions on google based programs unfortunately amazon wallet isnt terribly useful at this point it doesnt take advantage of the phones nfc chip to allow tapandpay at the newer registers hopefully amazon wallet will become more feature rich as time goes by ive sideloaded a few applications which werent in the amazon applications store with mixed results most work including google chrome but some dont like my banks application sideloading is really easy to do and the instructions are readily available on the internet the phone is now a bargain at 99 cents i paid considerably more at the att store very disappointing bottom line for me is that i came from a samsung galaxy s4 and for the first few days i missed the s4 ive come to prefer the external button layout of the fire phone i always had a problem with pressing the volume buttons on the other side of the phone when pressing the off button on the s4 i now prefer the fire phone because it supports gmail even better than the galaxy s4 and because the fire phones method for accessing program options is more logical than other android phones for example when in contacts the vip contact list is accessible by flicking the phone slightly from the right or dragging from the right and the contact options are available on the left its possible to operate the phone with one hand which is a real advantage after you learn how the phone has a learning curve and after putting in some time with the phone i appreciate the phones design more and more all the time the battery life of the fire phone is much better than the samsung s4 i usually have over 50 of a charge left at bed time i have blue tooth wifi gps and nfc turned on all of the time the face and eye detection sensors are much better on the fire phone than on the s4 the fire phone scrolls text very smoothly which makes reading easier the screen resolution of the fire phone is also better than the s4 the camera on the fire phone as many features that the samsung s4 doesnt have and again it takes time to learn all of them the camera has several features which i appreciate such optical stabilization automatic hdr mode a very sophisticated panorama capture feature and full resolution burst capture im looking forward

a lot of phone for the money there are a couple of recommendations that you will need to do with it right out of the box to get the best performance out of the phone but once done the phone will perform just as well in most tasks as the more expensive top tier phones that are available today first the phone will need to be updated to android 44 after updating i found the stock google launcher to be a little light on features and a little sluggish feeling on the touch input so i went with nova launcher which completely took care of any input lag that the phone had out of the box i also went with swiftkey for the keyboard because the stock google keyboard felt a little laggy the changes to the launcher and the keyboard made all the difference in the world as the input speeds can be manually adjusted in these free apps the phone now feels the way i would expect a 500 plus dollar phone to feel and when ompared side by side to a samsung galaxy mega felt smoother and faster gaming performance is acceptable if thats your thing and the phone will play all of the newer 3d titles reasonably well spec wise you get a phone that is comparable in performance to a samsung galaxy mega

many hours with blu customer support one woman there told me to do a hard reset and i lost all the stuff i had on the phonephone numbers of contractors i was waiting to hear from calendar notations notes to myself everything yes she told me to back it up but since i didnt have anything saved on the phone that i knew of ie pictures i didnt think i needed to big mistake anyway after waiting ages for an available rep and going through hours of customer support on the phone thank goodness i had access to a land line for this they agreed to take it back since it was still under warranty they sent me an email with the label and i sent it off but not before taking it in to a repair place because i really needed to have a phone they said it was probably the microphone and if it was still under warranty i should send it back they also told me it was a very cheap phone and that it was probably the microphone in the meantime i had to have a cell phone so i bought another one for approx 99 an amazon warehouse deal that i got within 2 days i began using it and found that like the last one the volume was not terribly good especially on speaker but tolerable and it seemed to be working fine to reactivate the sim card i had to pay another 20 to my carrier by now ive now paid 168 for the 1st phone 99 for the second 25 for first activation and 20 for the second activation for a total of 312 i begin to think i should have gotten a better phone but i really liked this one so i wanted to stick with it my daughter suggested i buy a better case to protect it in case i dropped it so i

knew it was the crappy microphone mechanism again yes its a cheaply made phone and i once again got on the phone to blu once again they said they couldnt issue me an address for the return unless i did a hard reset rather than go through it all again do the hard reset and call us back means talking to a different person the next time who will need all your information again even though they have

intrusive at all which i think was done very tastefully everything about this phone has impressed me from the start and im still discovering things after a month i suggest to anyone who is on the fence to try it out unless you decide otherwise beforehand you will most likely end up loving this phone', u'believe the hype', (5L, 1L, u'null', 0L, u'32 GB', 2507, 16))), (u'H', (u'i read all the reviews good and bad before buying this cell phone my main reason for buying was the size of the screen and the price im not sure what those who gave this phone a bad review were looking for but it has given me everything i wanted and more the phone has great definition bright clear and crisp i get great photos from both the front and rear cameras its fast easy to set up and everyone who sees it wants it i have had an iphone and lg g2 and i would put this phone up against them any day with a price that is 50 to 60 less than many smartphones of smaller size it is a winner all around if there is a con to the pros it is that there doesnt seem to be any cases or screen protectors on the market yet thats probably why on top of everything else thats good about this phone it came with a case and a screen protector now the case isnt otter box comparable but it will work until i find something better and its a good indicator that the company was thinking about the consumer by including it

41114 i am loving this phone after using it for a while i really love the size at first it took a little getting used to but now i absolutely love the 6 screen and dont think i will ever go back to a smaller phone i look at my spouses 5 phone and have to squint i have only come across two issues 1 the usb charging cord doesnt work any longer i have in no way abused the cable since it has been sitting nicely on my desk the whole time connected to my computer the plug that connects to the phone has come loose i have replaced the cable with a miniusb cable i already have and it charges fine again 2 it is very easy for me to hold down the power button when i am holding the phone during conversations there is just something about the way that my hand wants to grip the phone that i am constantly losing calls because the phone resets when the power button is held down long enough as time goes on i am becoming more and more aware of how i hold the phone and to be careful but there has been a learning curve about where to hold the phone properly original review first for the price i dont think you can get a much better deal at the moment the phone is not perfect but the feature set to price ratio is pretty good ive been on this phone nonstop for 5 days before writing this review there are a lot of video reviews available which cover all of the details  so here are my personal impressions pros good build quality its heavy but because it packs a 6 screen good battery life i get almost a full day excellent large screen fits well in average to large hands standard android without bloatware charger connects to top of phone love this feature its unlike most phones where the charger connects to the bottom of the phone very useful for using phone while charging average processor speed its fast enough to get most things done but probably not the best device if you want to play processorintensive appsgames update 3815 i havent experienced any lags as i see some other reviewers mentioned silicone case is soso nothing to brag about but gets the job done until i find something better call quality isnt the greatest volume at maximum is just ok in average noise settings ie a supermarket touchsensitivity its good but not as good as more expensive devices cons needs better touch sensitivebuttons below the screen i still miss hit the buttons and have to press several times for response even after 5 days of practice builtin speaker quality is not above average cameras these are not iphone quality cameras no matter what i do i cant get clear pictures despite the ok megapixels seems that it may be a softwarehardware issue i truly believe that the pros outweigh the cons for the current asking price youll be hard pressed to find a 6 device with this featureset for less i think you will be mostly pleased if you mostly use this device for the internet and tasks that are not processorintensive its strongest suits are not actual voice calls but who talks on the phone anymore anyway as for any other cons the cameras are probably the biggest disappointment although i thought that the 6 device would be generally too large i really do love the

turn on and stopped charging i sent the phone in for warranty repair it took 3 weeks to get a replacement blu deemed the phone defective i got a replacement tried to turn on the phone it wont turn on tried to connect it to a charger the phone wouldnt charge otherwise i got another brick the replacement phone was shipped ground i have reason to believe maybe the battery froze in shipping due to 20 below temperatures and 40 wind chills since the battery is hardwired and opening up the case will void the warranty i have no choice but to send it back in again the first replacement took a turnaround of about 3 weeks i will give the benefit of the doubt and say the phone broke during the holidays and maybe blu product repair was backlogged but i probably will be without a phone another 3 weeks i wish warranty repair would have a way to swap phones like pay 15000 deposit and they send you a phone right away but they dont at this point in time i am disappointed it is a great phone when i can get the phone to work   i had the phone for a few weeks now my previous phone was a galaxy s2 i had that phone for about 3 years unfortunately i left that phone in my pocket and it went through the wash i had to replace the s2 i was looking for another galaxy phone for a replacement  maybe an s3 s4 or s5 but the prices for an unlocked were still out of the range i wanted to pay i really enjoy the service from h2o wireless 3000 to 4000 a month for a smartphone plan i priced contract phones call me cheap but i cant justify forking out 30000 for a new phone and paying 8000 a month for the next 24 months anyway i ran across a couple of reviews for the blu studio 60 hd i researched it further on you tube and thought i would give it a try the phone exceeds my expectations pros processor speed is great screen is large 6 inches phone is not flimsy this phone is larger and thicker than the samsung note i would say its built more solid than the galaxy note phone comes with a screen protector and a case the case isnt anything fancy but at least its free to my surprise my phone comes with an fm radio no att bloatware or any other bloatware of any kind phone came stocked with android kit kat operating system unlocked the phone took my h2o wireless sims with no issues dual sims i no longer have to carry around 2 phones phone seems to have very good battery life no problem tethering and tethering not blocked cons i dont like built in batteries with any phone in general i would like to have the option to easily pop a fresh battery in from my spare wall charger i cant do that with this phone  also i had android phones that had built in batteries in the past if the phone locked up i have to wait for the battery to go completely dead in order to give the phone a fresh reboot which could be a week i never had such an issue with this phone i am concerned that will happen i had a couple of issues when i turned on the phone into some sort of diagnostic menu and the phone is in chinese after some playing around i was able to clear that there are some paid apps that worked fine on on my s2 that wont work on the blu studio 60 i guess thats expected the time lapse video is a great feature but the camera doesnt take the greatest pictures if you are using it for posting on facebook or social media this phone will work fine for that camera also takes panoramic pictures from what i can tell it is difficult to find any other cases screen protectors for this phone just because the phone isnt mass produced and has an odd size my galaxy s2 was easy to fix with broken screens charging ports speakers microphones it might be difficult to cheaply find spare parts for this phone otherwise everything seems to be working great i would highly recommend this phone to anyone most of my issues that i addressed are minor this phone does everything i want it to do an then some my wife and daughter are gamers and they played games using this phone the phone keeps right up with their iphones and is sometimes faster if the phone didnt boot to the chinese menu once in awhile id give it 5 stars update 12102014 there was a software revision a few weeks

say that i really like the phone so far there are a couple things that i dont like but they are not deal breakers and can probably be fixed later with updates my old phone is a motorola atrix 4g i will start with the cons first 1 i already miss the finger print scanner from my atrix the lock screen for the fire is simple with little options 2 there is a large section of ringtones and notification sounds but nothing that i really like i was able to make songsfull songs in my library ringtones on my old phone update if you plugin your phone to the computer you can copy and paste full mp3 songs into the ringtone folder  use those songs as ringtones 3 the phone is very slender and when i try sliding the carousel on the phonefrom right to left i almost always end up sliding out the right hidden panel which displays the weather for my area 4 i still have to get certain apps from 1mobile market to get the apps i likeonly 2 5 the battery life seems poor unlike it stated on the website i doubt it will even last a day on a full charge i will update this later after i have used it for a full dayi had a full charge  1030am it is now 245pm and im  78 i have not used it much at all no games no movies no books just registered it today flipped through the setting made one call and a couple of text the pros are 1 the inverted 3ddynamic perspective is visually stunning and doesnt make me dizzy or nauseous while looking at it 2 the peek to show battery life time and wifi bars is ingenious just slightly tilt the phone to see these items show up at the top of the phone then they disappear when you tilt it back nice 3 when displaying the list of texts from previous individuals it shows a 2 or 3 etc on texts that were sent to a group of people very smart i like this 4 to go back to the previous page just slide up from the bottom of the phone i didnt know this at first and was screaming at myself how do i go backwheres the back button stooped phoohh thats how 5the phone works as a phone and fits in the hand nice although it is a little slim for my fat hands 6 i like the swipe keyboard it should be standard for all phones 7 the firefly buttonapp is a great addition to this phone i can now get rid of the 3 apps i was using to do the same thing all in all this is a really good phone it has some great features and seems to work really good so far i will update this review when i have had more time with it by the way it is now 318pm and im  76 battery without using the phone update at 137pm the battery died while watching a movie so the battery did last for a 24 hour period on 1 charge with minimal use except for the movie i also got an alert at 15  5 battery life to plug in the phone the phone did get warm while watching the movie but not hot the picture on this phone is amazing very clear and crisp let me also add that my old phone is still at an 85 charge with only little usetransfers and checking status 2nd update i drained the battery on my phone and did a full charge again holy cow i think it worked today at 440pm july 26i unplugged my phone and was at 100 it is now 135amjuly 27 and i am at 93 grant it i havent used my phone that much being at work and all but that is 100 better than yesterday if you are having trouble with your battery try draining the battery by watching a movie or something then give it a full charge while its turned off i think it took about 25 hours i didnt keep track but this is more like it i hope this helps if it works for you pass it on 3rd update7312014 i am very pleased with this phone i have been using this phone like i would use any other phone the call quality has been great i tend to play music on this for about 6 hours at a timeduring work i dont watch movieshows on my phone and very rarely play games on it and the battery is still lasting 24 hours at a time the phone has some really good features like showing extras under the apps in the carousel especially for email and texts this also navigates very easily i havent had problems finding anything that i need and anything that i need takes very minimal steps to get to the camera and firefly are pretty sweet the camera takes great photos and firefly has been recognizing most of the music tv shows and products that i have tested it with i would say it works about 98 of the time one post that i did read mentioned that most people tend to hit the home button when theyre done looking at or doing whatever theyre doing on their phone this can leave programs or apps running in the background while you use your phone draining the battery even quicker the best thing to do is swipe back after youre finished with whatever youre doing this will close out the program or app i have been reading both negative and positive feedback on the phone make sure that the feedback you read is from a verified purchaser i read one that said i dont own this phone but i do have an opinion of itand it was of course a negative review lol how stupid some people just make me laugh sometimes anyway i havent had any problems or major glitches with this phone and this will probably be the last update unless something major comes up just remember that the phone does have a 1yr manufacturers warranty on it incase something does go wrong with it thanks to everyone who has responded and those who have purchased this phone i hope you

screen size ive got small hands but havent had any issues with this monster yet it has taken a bit of getting used to but i find that to be the case with any new item when youre used to something else ive had more trouble getting used to the android way of doing things than with handling the phone itself but again thats just from being completely unfamiliar with the android product line i do look forward to seeing what it can do its a bit less intuitive than apples os but i do have to say that when i first started using the iphone 4 for work i wanted to throw it out a window at least once a day we eventually reached a truce however and im hoping it will be the same with the htc first impressions its big not so big that it wont mostly fit into a pocket but its quite a jump up from a 4 screen im attaching a pic of the two phones for size comparison the htc will definitely stick out lengthwise from a back pocket the ringtone choices are limited  pretty sad but youre able to record your own so i likely will do so as others have said its got 8gb of storage and about half that is taken up by preloaded software that seems pretty standard however and id already planned to pick up an sd card to increase space sooner rather than later thats not an option with the 5c or any iphone so thats a point in this phones favor call clarity is ok but not nearly as good as either iphone its really only about as good as my current vm flip phone which is at least 5 or 6 years old maybe more   when using the htc on speaker however its terrible i use the speaker more often than not when talking on the phone as im usually busy doing things  need my hands so thats one thing im hugely disappointed with i havent explored many apps yet but have not been all that impressed so far with whats included most seem to require you to log into a google account in order to even see what they are and i find that incredibly irritating im not a big fan of google and find them highly invasive in everything they do which is why i avoided purchasing an android phone for so long the app situation seems to be more of the same i do read on my phone a lot so at the very least im going to need an

and responding to many questions im just going to throw my immediate thoughts in there are definitely some caveats to this phone some of which ill detail below the case included is the only one ive found that fits it but even this one isnt perfect the cutouts for the headphones and charging dock are not large enough i have to take the case off at night to charge the speaker cutout is not in line with the speaker itself and the button covers are not hollowed out inside so the buttons become very sensitive to the touch overall i think more time was spent going for design with this case versus functionality its a nice looking case but its far too smooth on the back to provide any decent grip that being said ive dropped the phone twice and both times it took the short falls in stride the screen bounces between being too responsive and not responsive enough part of this i believe but have yet to test is the included screen cover its nothing special in the least application was a pain as always and bubbles around the edge are impossible to get out nothing new there but since i have yet to find a premium cover that is fitted to the blu im just ignoring the bubbles the buttons on the front of the phone are also toonot responsive the camera 8mp works fine for my uses but can be a bit slow to focus in and commit to the actual picture taking with a steady hand pictures and videos turn out great i recommend enabling the volume rocker to be used for the camera button as the onscreen button based on my toonot responsive issues takes too many screen taps to finally hit for me the frontfacing camera is nothing new and fancy at all but it does give you the ability to take selfies and video chat with others so its just fine for me despite having very large hands i still find myself having issues with managing to hold the phone without it feeling awkward that being said if you dont mind committing to finding that sweet spot or feel comfortable using two hands on your phone this shouldnt be an issue watching movies on the huge screen is a treat when i dont have my tablet with me to stare at i recommend trying to hold a samsung galaxy note in your hands first as this is slightly larger if youre comfortable with it chances are youll adjust fine to the size of this phablet bluetooth is a joy and a pain it does work but has frozen my device before the range is ridiculously minuscule in my experience with other devices ive managed a solid 1525 feet through two walls and still been connected to my speaker this phone gives me about 510 no walls at all i do wish more time had been spent improving this and for some people this may be a hangup for me its more or less something ive learned to live with speakerphone is worthless no one can ever hear me on the other end when i have the speakerphone on in the event i need to use it i connect to my bluetooth speaker which has a mic embedded and carry out the conversation this really is a big issue for me and id imagine quite a few people i almost returned the phone when i found this out just before i was ready to ship it out i decided id deal as finding this phone was hard enough if i could go back id definitely get it exchanged to make sure its not a defect with just my phone but im outside of that time zone now so im back to just dealing with it the speaker itself is in a horrible spot but i knew this before i purchased its loudish theres a definite tinny quality to the sound but i so rarely use the actual speaker that when i do i simply cup my hand around the speaker to redirect the sound not ideal but its not in my top 10 for worst features visual voicemail doesnt work for most services out the box some offer their own branded app my service provider did not but i remedied this with the freely available youmail app seeing as how this isnt the phones fault i didnt include this in my rating calculation but this could be an issue for some people so im throwing it in for anyone who may be interested although this is not the phones fault i take issue with kitkat it came preinstalled which is what i wanted and had hoped for but there are things about the os that irk me on a daily basis i note a small compatibility issue between the phone and kitkat but it does function 99 of the time again just my personal experience but for 95 of users this shouldnt be an issue a few features i enjoy dedicated buttons one of my major gripes with other phones are the lack of dedicated buttons although these are touchscreen buttons they still respond better than any onscreen button phones ive used another plus here is the screen real estate when viewing movies or playing games speaking of games let me just say how refreshing it is to game on my phone again i used to play constantly but my samsung galaxy s4 just wasnt up to par with graphics asphalt 8 is my current obsession  and yes the graphics are set to max i definitely recommend trying it out to really stress test your new phones graphics processor i do notice a slight heating but this is normal with any phone battery the battery my god the battery on this phone is fantastic with low use i managed almost a full 72 hours from full battery to dead usually i get an average of 36 hours with moderate usage and even on heavy usage it lasts me from the time i wake up until i pass out watching netflix on it my only bad note on the battery is that its not removable i knew this before purchasing so i was aware of what i was getting into that being said if the phone gets hung up you basically just wait until it resets itself typically 13 minutes from the point of freezing im sure theres a way to force a hard reset using the power and volume rocker but i havent found the right combination the two times its frozen up on me again my experience but i was stress testing when it happened so its really a nonissue in my stress testing ive had game after browser after tumblr after insert app name here the multitasking capabilities are amazing i typically install a sweeper program to tidy things up and free up memory every once in a while after installing it i was getting constant messages about the ram being at 90 but the device never faltered i truly believe it was just an issue with the sweeper so i just uninstalled it and manually close things once or twice daily just to help keep my phone solid ive never had an issue with having too many apps open while testing so i can only imagine a regular user would be ecstatic over the way it performs the charger is pretty standard but of nice build quality it looks and feels like the chargers included with premium phones not the cheap 099 charger and cords you find on ebay if that makes any difference to you the headphones included have a mic on the linein and are of midgrade quality for included headphones theyre awesome the rubber earbud replacements are nice three sizes to pick from it may sound weird but the box the phone comes in is really cool all on its own it reminds me of an iphone box when looking at the quality if youre giving this as a gift its definitely dressed for first impressions do i recommend this phone to some yes ive gone over my issues with the phone given some insight into a feature or two and all along the way tried to justify what i was saying so people who are less technical can understand what theyre purchasing if this is your first venture into the phablet market i might recommend something a bit more along the lines of the blu 5 if you are comfortable with the size and few issues that come along with it by all means snatch this up for those who are dropping their contracts in favor of cheaper service or transferring from other prepaid programs i really recommend you do your research on the phone services youre interested in using with this phone keep in mind this is a gsm phone  not cdma please know that the description of this ad may be misleading i ordered this with the intent of using it with cricket wireless as they had the best rate and coverage for my area and were listed in the description after two sim card issues i went to their store as soon as the employee saw the brand name they sighed the ad shows you an example of the possible gsmbased networks you can sign up with  this does not mean that the phone is compatible with them all if in doubt contact your preferred service provider and ask them if they are compatible with this phone or any you decide on also ask them if they provide the apn settings some sim cards include the settings such as simple mobile whom i ended up going with and recommend but others require manual entry cricket required manual entry of the settings but it still would not work with this phone thankfully i had multiple options for carriers  i highly recommend you do the same do i feel its worth the cost despite the issues ive encountered i feel im holding a phone worthy of the price tag my phones last at least a year and in most cases almost 2 with the price of this phone ive saved tons by going back to prepaid and still enjoy the same service id say its worth it

of this i called blu and they had me do a factory reset on the phone that did nothing to change the volume the reason i chose this phone is because i saw someone with and it seem to be a good phone as

on the side like the other models i love the clearness and color of this phone however it seems they either sent me a refurbished phone defective phone or the manufacture just threw this phone

certainly beats the 600 you would need to shell out for an iphone or samsung galaxy and performance is very comparable at 617 by 31 it took a while to get used the size of this phone it is very close to small tablet territory but still fits in my pocket comfortably below i have broken down this phone into 5 basic categories and included additional details for review of how i graded the phone display audio and camera 5 stars the screen on this phone is remarkable and the camera is better than any ive ever owned including stand alone digital cameras the screen is 55 and only 720p but do you really notice the difference between 720 and 1080 on a small device such as this images are crystal clear and colors are vibrant the touch screen is super responsive and due to the larger size it is much easier to type on this phone compared to my old one the 13 mp rear camera is capable of filming in 1080p which is nice in case you ever want to view your picturesvideos on a larger display like a computer or tv i have not yet used the front facing 5 mp camera but its nice to know its there in case i would ever want to use skype facetime etc the speakers on this phone are really good the boomsound speakers on this phone are the same as the ones on the more expensive htc one m8 they are not the best ive ever heard on a cell phone but they are pretty close and are better than the speakers on some laptops music audio for videos and calls are loud and clear i am very satisfied with the audio and video performance of this phone operating system apps and storage 45 stars the phone comes preloaded with android kit kat htc sense 6 all the normal virgin mobile bloatware and a few other useful third party apps ive found the combination of kit kat and htc sense 6 to be quite user friendly and intuitive i believe the phone will eventually be able to be upgraded to the lollipop release of android as the specs are there for it but whether virgin and htc allow it or not is another story either way the out of box os and user interface is good and should be suitable for new users as well as experienced android users the virgin bloatware is a pain and cannot be uninstalled i guess this is a necessary evil in exchange for affordable quality service as they insist on installing it on pretty much all of their phones some of the preloaded third party apps are quite nice i particularly like the fm radio receiver built into the phone combined with the next radio app which i now use more often than the iheartradio app also i was not a fan of htc blinkfeed at first but now that ive had the phone for a while and taken the time to customize itthis feature it is actually quite useful after all the preinstalled softwareapps you have about 6 of 8 gb of onboard storage left on the phone to add your own apps from the android play store which is by far the largest and most robust of all app stores in my opinion its a good thing the phone can take up to a 128 gb microsd card and more and more developers are allowing their apps to be ported over to sd storage or otherwise i would have issue with only 8 gb of onboard storage another note regarding storage and a nice perk with this phone is a free upgrade to 100 gb of space on google drive physical designfeel of phone 5 stars the phone is big as i mentioned above but at 582 oz it is surprisingly light well balanced and it fits comfortably in my hand the outer shell is a smooth hard plastic very similar to the stuff they use for the samsung galaxy phones the power and volume buttons are on the top left side of the phone i am left handed and love this as they are very easy for me to control with my left thumb while holding the phone in my left hand and talking there is not a physical homemenu button on the phone but there are digital buttons on the bottom touch screen that do the same thing some people have complained about this but i actually dont mind it at all the screen itself is corning gorilla glass 2 and is supposed to be scratch proof overall i think this phone has a great design and feel a lot of expert reviews ive read compare the design to an iphone 5c but larger and running android battery 4 stars speaking of the iphone one of the major issues that i do have with this phone is that like the iphone the battery is embedded and cannot be removed or replaced this scares me and almost stopped me from purchasing this phone so far i am glad i was able to move past it because i really do like this phone otherwise battery life so far has been great and the battery charges back up pretty fast as well so far there have been no issues here hopefully it stays that way since there is no way to replace the battery if it does become a problem this is my lowest scoring category for the phone because of the lack of options if the battery ever does become a problem but so far so good service 5 stars 45 month for unlimited talk text and data need i say more coverage is very good everywhere ive been in the us virgin uses sprints network so you can pretty much get phone service and at least 3g data speeds anywhere this is a 4g lte phone and the speed of data on this band where available is impressively fast my previous phone was 4g wimax which is also fast and lte is noticeably faster to me lastly the phone is on a cdma network so it may not be ideal for international use that being said it does have all the hardware needed to be used on a gsm network so with a little tinkering and some determination im sure it could be unlocked if the need arose i

a review because i thought it was just a new phone that was irritating me i had to purchase a phone it had fairly good reviews and i was on a very limited budget but since i needed to get a phone i figured i was buying a midrange phone smart so i wouldnt need to replace it as soon as one that was super cheap 1 cant use this phone without headset 2 huge i thought i could get over the side but unless im wearing a suit jacket there isnt a female pocket that can house this phone meaning if you want to walk around the house with your phone it doesnt fit in the bustiest bra you need to walk around with a purse 3 updates are clunky ive had the most problems with this phone 4 tried to eat up data within the first two days of having it never had a phone that constantly tried to update in the background so much in the day of finding everything to shut off i actually took out my card so i could find everything that was running so it didnt chew through more data 5 the power button and the volume keys are on the sides the only part that would be exposed if you magically got it to fit in a pocket however if your pocket bumps it it would shut down your phone 6 ive had it this phone since april 1 2015 it is now the 22nd it now has some sort of glitch where if i try to call someone it will try to call two other people after i hang up there is nothing on the screen and ive never dropped the phone so if im not paying attention it tries to call two other people this has been for the past 2 days i tried rebooting nothing 7 if you hold down the volume key and the power key at the same time easily done due to the configuration of keys it starts a boot configuration key  in japanese you cant just hold the power key it makes you do the same test pattern every time in japanese you dont know what the heck it is but it ends up being power volume up volume down back home window you cant break out of it and you cant take out the battery because its locked in if you have this phone you can hold the powervolume downhome key and eventually it will reboot maybe took me forever to figure that out i could go on im stopping myself i paid 90 dollars for this phone because i used my amazon credits to pay for it not worth it the screen is crystal clear but if i ever drop it obviously that will be kaput i have nothing good to say about this phone its a product of my budget and desperation that i am stuck with this phone i do not have the money to afford better but i wont be wasting my money on this again i agree with one of the other reviewers that its a bad sign when

price its fantastic edit 09222014 removed one star due to a few quirks ive found with the phone as ive got used to it  the camera its laggy and it doesnt do very well at all in slightly dark conditions photos end up very grainy it requires above average lighting other than that it takes pretty amazing photos  lock screen notifications if youre switching from iphone youre gonna miss having notifications wake up your phone and display in the lock screen without having to unlock the phone for example when you get a text message its kind of ridiculous because ive seen htc screenshots of other phones that do have this feature functional but for some reason it just would not work on this phone i had to download a 3rd party app called nils in order to get this feature and then tweak and tweak until i got to function similar to an iphone  unnecessary notification icons theres a lot of these occupying the notification space on the top of your device and you cant turn them off for example the alarm icon and the boomsound icon i already know my phone has alarms active and that it uses boomsound technology i seriously dont need it taking up space in my notifications and it provides no way of turning them off unless you delve into developer stuff which i guess i could go into but come on not everyone has the time or expertise of doing that  the battery not as good as people make it sound but its still better than my last iphone 4s  default pictureviewing gallery app completely ridiculous and cumbersome i dont know who came up with that garbage but whoever decided to have that as the picture viewing app needs to get fired from htc immediately i downloaded quickpic instead  choppy backlight when you leave this phone on dim light to save battery and then when you wake it up using the lock screen button it doesnt light up smoothly its hard to explain its like it skips brightness levels from off to dim instead of smoothly lighting up but this only happens when you have low brightness levels though but ive seen 50 phones not do that so its kind of amusing this happens with this phone  default texting app and keyboard just suck i downloaded google keyboard and google hangouts for sms texting much better and prettier  location services is confusing the location services icon is always present unless you completely turn if off so i never really know if its being used but then if i need to use google maps i need to go back and turn it on why cant it be like iphone where i allow location services on a perapp basis so it turns on by itself whenever its needed its annoying but i decided to just leave it on and i believe its had no effect on my battery life so far its not that big a deal now some highlights of what ive really liked about this phone to counter some of its shortcomings  the form factor it feels wonderful to hold this phone it feels well built do get a case though pray you wont get a crack if you drop your phone  the screen its great to have all that extra space in this huge screen and the pixel density is just perfect its a bummer not being able to use the phone with one hand thought but i cant complain about that its to be expected from a phone this big  blinkfeed a welcomed feature im not a social media junkie and yet ive found it useful to check on my feeds without having to go on my apps individually perfect for a quick fix  boomsound amazing sound quality from the speakers and it also affects whatever you plug in the headphone jack the technology isnt limited just to the phones speakers  performance butter

midpriced phone that looks and acts like a flagship model i love it the display is fantastic the battery life is more than adequate especially when you disable the blinkfeed etc and its really easy to set up and transfer all your stuff it may not be the fastest processor on the market but at this price point its pretty impressive i augmented the storage with an inexpensive 32 gb card and moved over everything i could five big stars i bough the phone a tempered glass screen protector this is not gorilla glass and a snug neoprene case for under 200 crazy people are astonished to find out what i paid for this phone and that my plan is only 35month for unlimited text and data also virgin mobile had discontinued selling this phone and soon it may not be available for purchase anywhere', u'great phone great price', (5L, 1L, u'null', 0L, u'Unidentified', 947, 23))), (u'H', (u'ive had my fire phone just over a month now for the first few days i was convinced id be trading it for another android i fumbled through normal operations and the phone didnt seem to offer basic features and conveniences with a little perseverance i discovered it did have the features i was missing i just hadnt figured them out for instance back took me a week to figure out how to go back a screen had i taken the time to watch the intro video id have learned sooner same with time stamps and other things the peek feature shows i wasnt happy with the existing email app but found a good one in the app store i think it was 3 but the free coins i got with my purchase paid for it  as well as a few other apps im not a big phone app user so i havent found many things i miss but im sure many will be disappointed with the selection i do miss snapchat  the dp i can take or leave beyond the wow factor its pretty useless firefly is handy i also like the visual voicemail feature i find the carousel clunky but i dont like it on my kindle either instead i use the home screens so no biggie there the phone is on the heavy side if im wearing loose pants and have the phone in my pocket i have to keep hitching up my trousers i affixed a screen protector and have had no issues interacting with the screen since then the tilt screen is a little goofy it works for some screens but not others like kindle where it would be most useful occasionally the home button doesnt work and i have to restart the phone but i had the same problem with several androids  theyd run out of steam memory something and needed a little nudge in the form of a reboot same problem my kindle does the same thing so i guess i should have expected this the keyboard and texting are a strong feature i swipe text and use the microphone and both are comfortable and work well the camera takes fantastic pictures the pinch zoom takes some getting used to my sony used the volume buttons i havent taken any videos yet i use the music player quite a bit and the sound quality is excellent not totally thrilled with the music player but i havent gone looking for a different one ive watched a few videos and the picture quality is very good att sent me to their website to transfer my contacts but they werent set up to accommodate the fire i dont know if thats changed i still havent transferred all my contacts but maybe it was just time to clean house battery hasnt been an issue so far but then im not on the phone all the time what i miss most snapchat as i mentioned notification light if i miss a call or message i wont know until i wake the phone up this is what cost the fire a star emoticons within messages cant block any numbers or automatically send them to voicemail no main screen background for those complaining about no youtube there is now a youtube app and im sure more apps will find their way to the store over time amazon is pretty good about responding to the demands of their users i was already locked into att so no arguments there the way they have it set up the fire didnt cost me any more than most of their other phones would have wifi works well which is more than i can say for my kindle lately so after a month of use i am satisfied and glad i kept the phone i have no doubts that amazon will continue to improve the device and offer users more helpful features its probably not for everyone but it will work just fine for me', u'glad i stuck it out', (4L, 0L, u'null', 2L, u'32

bright screen the ppi isnt as high as other highend phones but the 1280 x 720 720p screen looks good very good even theres some minor very minor darkening distortion along the top edge but its almost never noticeable fast and responsive apps and navigating are breeze on this thing compared to my old acer iconia a200 more on that below this is no comparison sure youd like to have 2 gb of ram instead of 1 and the 4 gb onboard storage is frankly a little weak but overall the hardware has more than enough juice no bloatware comes with a bare bones stock install of android kitkat 442 which is great this is a beautiful device for ereading battery life is excellent for a screen this big youll easily get 710 hours of hard use on a single charge on days with only minor use you can easily go 72 hours between charges granted by the end of day 3 im under 10 remaining but still the cons as stated you cant turn a phone into a tablet even when you and the manufacturer really really want to this is a phablet pure and simple granted its still small enough to fit into a typical front pocket in a pair of jeans but its still a large mobile device im tall with big hands and im usually fine using it with one hand as a phone but for anything else two hands is needed dont get me wrong i really enjoy using this phone the overall experience is great the problem is the blu studio 6 is both too big and not big enough at the same time a little background my wife goes through about a phone every 2 years she drops them cracks the screen etc this past year she got her upgrade but i was using an old android 22 phone and an aging android 40 acer iconia tablet for my portable tech well during an exercise run on the treadmill i ended up knocking the tablet off and cracking the screen kaput so at that point i had the choicedo i get a new tablet or kill two birds with one stone and get a phablet one of the reasons id gotten a tablet in the first place was to read pdfs the problem was my old iconia a200 was just toodangslow to render pdfs of any size or complexity but i also really wanted a new phone i looked at and considered the galaxy s5 galaxy mega huawei ascend mate2 and the blu studio 6 i was this close to purchasing the ascend mate2 until my wife wandered by and said for that price you can get both the blu studio 6 and a kindle fire so why not do that instead so i went ahead and ordered the blu studio 6 thinking that maybe just maybe it would do the job on its own and i wouldnt have to even order the separate tablet sadly as cool as the studio 6 is and truly it is a very very cool phone its juuuuuuust not quite big enough to surf the web and read pdfs clearly like it would be on a 9 or 10 inch tablet     yet its too large to be a really comfortable as a phone a great device stuck in no mans land if you dont care about reading pdfs this phone jumps up to at least 45 stars that said surfing the web feels     strange somehow on a small screen you just accept the fact that you have to workaround the device limitations this phone feels like you should get a more full bodied web surfing experience but the size limitations are just enough to make you yearn for an extra 152 inches of screen real estate granted surfing pages is fast and responsive but the screen real estate just isnt quite there to really make it a treat hopefully if nothing else ive

on the road and relatively easily read and make sense of what you looked up unlike the other tiny screen devices on the market that turn even the slightest task into a swipe fest it also accepts the otg adapters built for samsung which allows you to attach a camera card or external flash or hard drive directly to it handy for working with and emailing photos from a higher quality camera and

documenting my life moving along always with the blu in one pocket and hq canon ps in the other but i can see that being the trend now the only reason i dont give this phone 5 stars is that i got a good one of the lot heaven forbid if you buy one and dont return it to amazon within the 30 days if it has a defect i have been banned all my posts deleted from the blu developers online forum for criticizing their support and their design of models such as the blu studio 55 which has a very flimsy sd card trap door that breaks after about 10 swaps of the card additionally blu support is a black hole when asking for second level support seemingly just sending out canned answers to various reported problems at least in the instance of the 55 i owned for 3 weeks plus if it is your desire to root or do experimenting with the os blu wont provide you a factory backup of the image and as of today there doesnt appear to be anyone online offering one as well so if that is your intention to root and to experiment do a lot of research on it before buying for example the program iroot2 which is the only known rooting application turns the factory test page to chinese other than that it

the phone integrates with them before the fire phone i had a samsung galaxy 3 and have also had iphones and blackberries in the past i have had the firephone for over a month now and like it the phone is well polished all of the stock programs email contacts calendar camera weather messaging phone photos as well as the settings menu are all extremely well done and are better than the corresponding stock android programs i use these programs the most which is why i will say this phone is better than a galaxy or other stock android phones in particular the email camera and weather programs are a great deal better than the corresponding stock android programs in particular email search on the firephone is better than on my galaxy which increases my productivity the camera is extremely handy onebutton access even when the phone is locked and picture quality is very good similarly firefly is great and can be accessed via button from a locked phone  i use it frequently for music identification shazam  soundhound when i might not have time to both unlock the phone and get to the right app on my galaxy it also reads qr codes in addition to just about everything else the maps program is better than i initially thought it might be competition here is quite high as the stock android navigation program is extremely good as well amazons maps program has destination search ie search for space needle instead of typing in an address including voice search that works well this makes it comparable to androids maps program and possibly better than apples the ui for amazons maps program is more aesthetic than using googles navigation and similarly provides turnbyturn directions the quality of directions seems fine to me over a few dozen journeys where i have used it although i suspect that the android directions are better due to greater usage and thus more data to feed back into their system i can say that amazons maps does not cover all of or any of europe as the stock android navigation program does the look  feel of the firephone is as well polished as the stock applications the ui is not as configurable as an android phone but given how well things work that is just fine with me i was not excited about having to configure the galaxy to get rid of junk programs  no need to do that on the firephone scrolling and general device navigation seems better than on other android phones basically on par with an iphone i find the firephone to be more fun to pick up and use than a galaxy kind of like an iphone in this respect but without being locked into the overrestrictive iphone ecosystem voice dictation for text entry works really well  better than on my android phone which is surprising i use this a lot the amazon music video bookskindle and audible applications all work well using these on the firephone is simply better than on a galaxy the phone hardware itself is aesthetic  the dimensions color finish etc all look good the screen dimensions are just narrow enough that i can reach everything with my left thumb the fire phone is a few millimeters thicker than the galaxy perhaps one minor thing to make the device seem clunky particularly with a case the device is a few grams heavier than other phones as well but that doesnt bother me the camera program is also a significant step up from the galaxy 3 it is fast to load and generally responsive and the colors look better to my eye i was able to take multiple photos per second by pressing the shutter button successively and i love that the program is always available by clicking the button on the side of the phone a few key tips that i learned  there is no physical back button but you can do the same thing by swiping up from the bottom of the screen this in combination with the home button work well together  by default the device has a clean look with very few characters no time or battery indicators listed tilt the device to one side or the other to make these widgets show up  this is one example of how dynamic perspective helps to make the device clean looking and fun to use i ended up going into settings to turn on the display bar settings  display so that i always see the time and battery level use mayday if you want help configuring this  tap the button twice quickly to scroll through active applications swipe applications up to close them  mayday is always available i love this any time i have a question about the phone an amazon is one click away from answering it this is a bold move by amazon if my galaxy had this functionality i would have used it continuously to complain about a ton of minor glitches as i remarked earlier the amazon phone is better polished than the galaxy which makes it possible for amazon to provide this superior level of support  when you shake the phone it goes to the settings menu i turned this off configure low motion settings from the display menu or just use mayday to ask an amazon agent this messed up my jogging program i would look down and see settings instead of my exercise progress to be sure there are a few kinks along the way  here is what i have found so far 1 i could not find prime playlists in the default amazon music app i used mayday to ask where it is  they had me download a different application called amazon prime music from the app store it is not integrated with my music but this is a newer program for amazon and i imagine they will fix it in the next few months 2 some programs are not available in amazons app store for a few of these i was able to move the program over to the kindle phone from my galaxy as follows 1 install an apk extractor program on the galaxy 2 choose the program to move over and extract it 3 email the apk apk file to the firephone as an attachment 4 get the email on the firephone and click on the attachment to install it this may not work for all programs particularly those that utilize googles services but it does work for many of them 3 the phone gets hot with heavy use 4 at one point i lost my gps signal while using the maps program  i assume that the phone got hot and thus turned off this energyhoggingheatgenerating

(5L, 1L, u'null', 0L, u'Unidentified', 363, 15))), (u'H', (u'i started out last year with the blu studio mini lte a nice little lte phone with some great features it has been a solid reliable phone since i got it my only problem is that the screen on the mini is 45 and im in my mid40s with presbyopia bad vision i also find a need for a tabletlike device when im out working or playing and so i began my search for a replacement for my reliable lovable blu studio mini lte i first tried a 7 phablet while it worked well and i was very pleased with it the size was just too much i decided to try again and went back and forth between the blu studio 60 hd and the blu studio 60 lte my mini was an lte but even though straight talk would support it where i live theres not much in the way of lte coverage so that wasnt really a factor price was a factor and the lte was and still is significantly more expensive for that higher price you get a slightly better battery a slightly faster cpu and a slightly better frontback camera the screen resolution is a bit better on the lte but that big resolution draws a bit more cpugpu power too and some say its overkill on a 6 screen the screen size is the same they both currently run android 44 kitkat out of the box and theyre both quad core the hd is slightly thinner but the lte is 14 lighter than the hd in benchmarks they come up pretty close to one another the lte offers more storage space and ram but again you pay extra for that in the end i went with price vs slightly better features sure the lte is the better phone in many ways but considering that benchmarks reveal that im not losing too much power by going with the hd and a 64gb micro sd card takes care of the difference in storage space i thought it was a better choice for me the final factor was that a national brickandmortar chain started selling the hd for a reasonable price and i decided to take the plunge and grab one to try it if it was terrible i could just return it right it turns out i have no desire to return it its wonderful the only bump in the road was that i had a micro sim and had to grab a sim adapter because this phone uses the regularsized sims once i got the adapter in place my straight talk number was working fine the phone comes with a whole list of apns built in to set up your data connection with your service provider but i found better results when i entered the apn suggested by straight talk though there is a straight talk apn built into this phone apparently other apns listed are att net10 att gophone red pocket black wireless h20 wireless i cant testify as to how well any of those work but if youre wondering if this unlocked phone will work with your carrier you can be pretty sure it will if its one of the ones on that list this phone has a nice 3000 mah lipolymer battery and it lasts a good long while its rated to have 3g talk time of 24 hours 3g standby time of 371 days 2g talk time of 40 hours and 2g standby time of 408 days the down side is that this phones battery is nonremovable like an iphone or tablet this is necessary on a big phone like this the 6 phones with removable batteries all have much lowerpower batteries as a result of that feature and dont last nearly as long as this one its a tradeoff but i figure i swap phones every couple years anyway so i doubt this ones battery will stop taking a charge before i move on to another phone it supports wireless 80211bgn and does have the ability to tetherhotspot i dont recommend doing that with straight talk as they forbid it in their terms of use and will terminate your account if they catch you however if youre with a provider that allows it the feature is supported here of course this is a dual sim phone but i havent a need for that feature at this point i dont travel overseas and i dont have any intention of paying another provider for service while im still using straight talk you should know however that both of the sim slots are fullsized slots the gps works great its fast and accurate no problems there the front camera is decent for a 5mp phone camera ive no complaints pictures turn out sharp and clear the frontfacing camera is 2mp but its sufficient for selfies video chat etc this phone does indeed have a proximity sensor which is handy for blanking the screen when youre talking on the phone it also has an accelerometer and gyroscope so it does react to shakes tilts etc for various apps it does not have a compass however this was no big deal to me as my car has a builtin compass of course it supports bluetooth and plays nice with my cars sync feature as well as my various bluetooth headsets i cant recall how much space was available out of the box and i didnt write it down but i have all my regular apps loaded including a few large games as well as upgrades to the google apps and the system upgrade to 442 that was pushed to me shortly after powering on and i still have 583gb available in internal storage this is because this phone does play nice with 64gb microsdsdhcsdxc cards and ive got all my data music pictures videos and other media on the sd card it also let me make the sd card the default write disk which means most of my large games were loaded onto the sd card and not the internal storage several of the ones that didnt go straight to sd card still allowed me to move them to the sd card after installing this is a great feature it cant be understated that a nice phone with poor storage space management is not worth the effort and in this regard blu comes out way ahead of some competitors the back menu and home buttons are softcapacitive buttons not physical buttons theyre not on the screen itself but underneath it the work well but its taking me some gettingusedto because the back is on the far left and the menu is on the far right and thats the opposite of the way the blu studio mini lte was designed i run nova launcher instead of the stock launcher and it runs smooth as silk i did have problems with mx player pro though it completely froze the phone i ditched it and went with vlc for android and everythings fine again my favorite sms program textra doesnt seem to want to work all the time with this phone but messaging hangouts and messenger all work edit i reinstalled textra and entered in custom apn info into the app and now it works perfectly the phone comes with a screen protector sadly its not preinstalled the mini lte had one installed from the manufacturer which saved me a headache putting on these things is a delicate maddening exercise if youre a perfectionist that cant stand even one little speck of dust under it but it was still appreciated that one was included it also comes with a clear silicone case that fits rather tightly it seems to make the buttons a little more sensitive but ive learned to work with it also included is a decent set of earbuds better than most packins but not exactly highend either an ac adapter brick and a usb cord i think more manufacturers should include a basic case and a free screen protector this is a nice touch from blu using this phone onehanded isnt for the small people out there im not small and even my hands struggle to do things onehanded with this phone however i still wouldnt trade it for the smaller phone the screen is gorgeous with a great viewing range angry birds 2 looks terrific on this phone and my hd videos streamed from plex look gorgeous as i stated previously mine had android 440 out of the box and upgraded to 442 within a few hours of being powered on i havent noticed any significant difference between the two versions of kitkat it runs smoothly and hasnt given me any trouble thus far in fact my biggest complaint is that my phone holder in my car was no longer able to handle the job this phones too long to fit one way but not wide enough to fit the other i had to dig out a different style of phone holder to mount it properly this is a big beautiful lotsofbangforthebuck phone i adore it five stars update 8162015  so this past weekend they pushed the newest update for this phone to android 502 lolipop the update adds a few new apps from blu most notably blu help which takes you to a support site and opera browser which replaces the stock web browser app from the previous os the phone is definitely capable of running lolipop smoothly even with my preferred launcher running instead of the stock launcher and gives a few extra features including a new lock screen and battery management i also noticed that the data connection seems more stable than it did with the previous os and best of all it doesnt screw up the ability to store apps on sd card it is however a long update it took me the better part of 45 minutes for it to complete from the time i started the download via fast wifi to the time it rebooted into the lolipop if you do it make sure you have a full battery and some time on your hands with this update i cant really add stars since i already rated this five stars anyway so ill just say it doesnt drop the rating at all it maintains the high quality i expect from blu after some experience with their products id happily recommend this phone to anyone looking for a 6 unlocked device that runs lolipop update 1215  ive gotten a new sony xperia c5 and as a result im dropping the blu studio 60 hd rating to 4 stars yes its a great phone and i love it but its showing its age and lowertier functions now compared to newer phones granted theres no comparison pricewise so im leaving this at four stars to reflect that for the price this is an excellent phone but when compared to a higherend phone it begins to show some weakness only a little but thats why im only docking one star its still the best bang for the buck i think its just an older choice that may begin to lag behind in specs soon', u'my second blu and my former favorite phone now running lolipop', (4L, 0L, u'TOP 500 REVIEWER', 0L, u'Unidentified', 9743,

it on a small screen anyway yes 55 inch is big but opening two windows on that size well i rather turn on my laptop to do so galaxy note 3 is somewhat better on the screen sharpness and works a little faster but its twice more expensive than this one i am satisfied with htc more than galaxy note 3 as i can literally buy two of these and still save some extra money for the same price i have weak

opted for the fire phone for myself and my son i have not been disappointed after having the iphone 3 and iphone 4s ive had the phone for a week now and as i learn to use the phone i am more impressed every day after reading the previous reviews and being an iphone user for so long i knew i would have to be patient learning how to use a new operating system what hit home for me was the ease of use for my 11 year old the fire being his first smartphone the first few days i found myself asking him how did you do that i was a bit nervous about the battery life and overheating battery drain was high and phone seem to run hot for the first few days but that has completely subsided after i figured out how to close apps after using them i use the phone for personal use and work purposes and several email accounts set up through the phone i live off my calendar for both work and home and have had no issues with calendaring my favorite features 1 while in email flicking the phone to the left and having attachments from your inbox show up this saves me from having to search for the email then clicking on the attachment 2 each email account has a different color code so i can quickly determine if an email is work or personal 3 twisting of the wrist to get to a well laid out summarysettings page this page gets quick access to airplane mode wifi bluetooth flashlight settings mayday search and screen brightness while at the same time giving you a quick status of your most recent notifications from phone calls email messages and apps 4 flicking the phone to the right and getting quick access to the app store photos and more 5 the apps that i use most frequently look better have added features and easier navigation than the iphone version i was completely surprised that would happen after using an iphone for so long i had to be patient to figure out the nuances in the apps i can see where iphone users may think the app doesnt work as well because it works differently with that said the only issue i have had with the phone is that my facebook app was glitchy called mayday super easy and helpful and they suggested i delete the app and reinstall worked like a charm and havent had any issues since 6 i like the feel of the phone the curve on the bottom edge of the phone makes it easy to grip and it doesnt feel like it is going to slip out of my hands like i felt with the iphone im very happy with my fire phone and glad amazon took the giant leap into the market', u'gave up the iphone and now im on fire baby', (5L, 1L, u'null', 0L, u'32 GB', 2586, 42))), (u'H',

upgrade to my galaxy s3 after much research and stumbling across this htc at an unbelievable price i feel like i got away with a steal pros 720p display with enough pixel density to look amazing and sharp colors are well balanced not over saturated like the super amoleds can be videos and photos have clarity and pop imo performance is solid barely a hiccup i was skeptical about the 15gb of ram but that little half of a ram really does give the phone an extra boost average tasks are a breeze it also holds up good when multitasking thanks also to the quad processor the cameras are awesome you really see the quality in the 13 megapixel back and 5 megapixel front and by the way most highend phones on the market right now do not have a 5 megapixel front facing camera im a smartphone geek and i have to say there are less than a handful of phones out right now that have a front facing camera as good as the desire 816 selfiecity the phones design with the double speaker grills give it a unique identity so many phones look alike these days that its nice when companies think of the subtle ways to make their phones look different also i had an apple loyalist friend of mine coincidentally pick up my phone yesterday and marvel at how light it felt i have no gripes about the weight and size now to the cons  yes there are a couple minor ones cons like another reviewer experienced my battery life doesnt live up to the benchmark tests including the video drain tests ive even seen professional reviews that say it can last you to the next day without recharging i use my phones a little above average my screen is cranked up to 100 i have live wallpaper and a few widgets running the most i get out of my phone on a typical day with no charging is roughly 810 hours this is better than any other phone ive ever had but not as stellar as i thought in terms of battery life however im more than grateful the battery is strong internal memory leaves a lot to be desired i dont have room for all my apps with the 8gb of storage and only 50 pics ive snapped so far ive never had a phone that required i delete stuff to shore up enough space to download a new app get a micro sd card asap i need one myself note it supports up to 128gb which rocks but i doubt i will do even half of that because they cost so much my final impression is you cant go wrong on this phone it has solid midrange specs but a nice big screen size which is typically associated with highend phones its a blessing to be so cheap for such good quality and to be able to use for a cheap prepaid rate i feel good i waited and thoroughly researched my options before finding this phone did i mention how great the price is ', u'be smart and get this phone', (4L, 0L, u'null', 1L, u'Unidentified',

4g i have experienced this restart the phone seems to fix it 25 seconds to refresh twitter feed down to 23 after the reboot pros solid phone doesnt feel cheap or flimsy nice large bright screen the audio boost feature works well im not audiophile but compared the beats sound boost on my old htc its on par camera placement is ideal both are covered so lenses wont collect dust comes with case headphones and screen protector cons the button layout is not ideal the volume is located on the left side of the phone exactly opposite of the lock button i find myself constantly changing the volume

notch or two and its fine they keyboard seems to struggle with fast typing not sure if it is the screen or the google keyboard ill switch it out and update my review the camera is very slow i am not able to get decent pictures if there is any sort of movement because of this delay i tend to use the burst mode to take multiple pictures and hope i get one even then i dont always get it if youre

at home customer service agent for virgin mobile and have been a loyal virgin mobile customer ever since i am sorry but i just dont understand paying the high contract monthly bills when i can get great phones like this and only pay 55 a month for unlimited talk text and data i purchased my phone from a shop at home tv channel on a flex pay plan i love this phone it has a full 13mp rear facing camera and 5mp front facing camera most phone only give you 5mp on the back and it takes awsome pictures it has a 55 screen the shop at home channel calls it a phablet i dont know if i would go that far but with amazon now coming out with a 6in fire hd tablet i guess you could i have had it for almost a month and i dont know everything the damn thing does the battery life is awsome i probably go about a day and a half without having to charge it and thats with pretty good usage i have a home phone in my office as well as a business line i had to do some faxing recently and plugged my home phone line into my fax i never took it out because now i only use my cell phone seriously thinking of discontinuing my home phone service altogether i had the 35 a month plan which only gives you 200 talk minutes but you still get unlimited text and data since i have a phone line i didnt talk much on my cell for a recent vacation i upped my talk plan to unlimited for the extra 20 per month since i was sure to need more talk time but left it at that plan once i came back thats what i love about virgin mobile you are not locked in to how much you wanna talk say your budget only allows for you to have the 35 plan but youre going home for christmas and need to use your phone more add an extra 20 bucks for that month and youre at unlimited talk when you come back change it back to stick to your budget the one con i have with virgin mobile phones is that you are locked into only purchasing dedicated virgin mobile phones no sim cards however this phone does have an actual removable sim card at this point i am not sure if i could get a tmobile sim card under their bring you own phone plan but the fact that the sim card is removable suggests its possible to take it to another carrier but i am not leaving virgin mobile to find out it does seem to have a lot of bloatware installed which is why i dont know exactly what all it can do but you can customize the phone to only show the apps you want to use thats another reason i dont know what all it does because i hid the crap i dont use and the beats speakers are awesomesauce this is my 2nd htc phone both having beats brand stereo speaker which is the main reason i so wanted this phone when i saw it and as always before i made the ultimate decision to purchase the phone i came to amazon to make sure there was a case available i
