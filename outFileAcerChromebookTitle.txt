I want to marry it!
Didn't believe you could get anything as good for 200$
A Few Tweaks compared to the C720, but still a Chromebook
Love this Machine!
Best Bang For Your Buck
Totally Blown Away!!!
Fast, light and easy to use.
Install crouton, run Linux, forget the ChromeOS Limitations
This is one fantastic personal computer
Smile, smile, smile for Chromebook
I love it!
Waited, Waited, Finally Pulled the Trigger---Glad I Did!
Acer cb3 is the best small chromebook.
Fast! Don't let the Celeron processor fool you!
Surprisingly useful "between-tablet-and-laptop" machine for the price
Love It!  (WITH MIXED FEELINGS)
Error message on boot up.
Crap !!!
Amazing Value; Transitioning Difficult But Doable, I Think
Only 4 STARS, compared to the C720
Please do not waste your money on the Samsung Chromebook, this one is much better!
Love the hardware, the offline versions of the apps are tricky to get working
Best investment I have made in a long time.
I LOVE my Chromebook . . .BUT
Goodbye Windows - Love my new Chromebook.

A Great Laptop
If this machine were a man, I'd marry it (or at least date it very seriously)
Needs more apps!
Price vs Performance Is Knock-Out; Just Think About Your Use-Case for Chrome OS
Potential GREAT FIT for that Senior Citizen in your life!
Add it to the list for 'Back to School'
Huge bang for your buck!
Pleasantly surprised.  Unbelievable value!
Acer, please do not ever stop making this amazingly therapeutic keyboard! You have created something truly spectacular!
