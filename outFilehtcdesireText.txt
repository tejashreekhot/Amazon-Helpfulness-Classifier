I wanted to give this 5 stars because the phone  itself is outstanding... But there is one big drawback for me.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>- Awesome 720p screen. The colors are vibrant and the blacks are very dark. Awesome.<br/><br/>- Great call quality. I am coming from the LG Optimus F3, and people say I sound amazing now and they can clearly understand me.<br/><br/>- Boom Sound. The main reason I bought this phone. I HATED having to cup my hand behind my phone or tablet so I could barely hear it. This thing... So awesome. I can hear it clearly over 2 23 inch fans and a 10,000 BTU air conditioning unit that's within 3 feet of my bed. Such an awesome feature, I don't know why every company doesn't do this.<br/><br/>- LTE. This is not the same thing as the 4G on the F3. This is blazing fast. 36Mbps+.<br/><br/>- No stuttering once I changed runtime to ART under dev options. Blazing fast, handles everything I've thrown at it.<br/><br/>- So much more to day but I am lazy. If you have any questions feel free to post here and ask, I'll be happy to answer!<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>There is only one con. And it'd very annoying.  All the benchmarks for this phone claim the battery is awesome and will last a full day. One States:<br/><br/> 12 hours plus of 50% screen brightness Google Chrome Web surfing.<br/><br/>7.5 hours of 75% screen brightness Netflix streaming.<br/><br/>As I have tested it. This is not the case as I have experienced. I don't have Skype, messenger etc.  Installed, or any apps that run in the background really. I don't use widgets, I use only one homescreen page with a few apps on it. And I only have the screen at 50% brightness.<br/><br/>With just Chrome running and browsing around on Google searches, Facebook, forums etc. I will  drain about 14-17% of the battery in 40 minutes. This is on wifi, with data disabled.<br/><br/>With Netflix going, after an one hour show I have drained 23-28% of the battery. This is at 50% brightness on wifi as well.<br/><br/>When it's asleep with wifi still on the battery doesn't budge. I left it on on my bedside table at 41% slept for 9 hours, woke up had a slew of Gmail, texts, etc. And the battery was still at 41%. So the standby battery life is great.<br/><br/>For some reason when you look at the battery stats it says time without a signal 100%.. But I always have a few bars. So I don't know what is up with that.<br/><br/>I really wish I could figure out why I am not getting the same battery life as the benchmarks.  Cause that is my only gripe with this phone.<br/><br/>I would still recommend this even with the subpar battery life in my case, cause the phone is just awesome.
Well I've had the phone for a few days now. Coming off of a Samsung Galaxy S4 and a ripoff contract through Cellcom, I was leary at first but I watched and read a ton of reviews online before making the purchase, I became pretty confident and made the purchase, I'm glad I did. The S4 was hands down the best phone I ever had......had. This phone coming right out of the box had an enormous impression size wise (enter:that's what she said joke #1), and I thought my S4 was big lol. The user interface that HTC has, very clean. It's taking some time to get used to, but it's nothing bad or difficult, just different. The screen resolution is on par with me, no visible pixels, plenty bright and very good color. The build quality is top notch, very nice design and material. One flaw though, as stated many times before in reviews, the back, it's glossy and a fingerprint MAGNET, very annoying. I suggest buying a case (good luck, very mediocre selection). The sound this phone produces through the dual front facing BoomSound speakers is PHENOMENAL. Watching movies, videos, and gaming is a treat and definitely worth bragging about. As far as how the phone runs, I'd have to say it's pretty fluid (smooth). I've gotten many compliments already about this phone, mainly about it's size (enter: that's what she said joke #2), and how nice it looks. For the price, this is by far the best phone you can buy. Almost a steal on Amazon. One more gripe, side button location. What the hell was HTC smoking when they decided to put the power AND volume buttons on the left side of the phone. Because of the size of the phone (even with my big hands) the reach convenience is killed. I will have to deal with it I guess. Have fun if you have small hands. Battery life, for the size, is pretty damn decent. Gets me through all day with average use. Just hope it lasts me, the phone is uni-body, which means you can't open up the phone and or change the battery. When it comes to the camera, it's one of the best on the market both front and rear.<br/><br/>Conclusion- Buy the phone. You won't be disappointed. I'm glad I did, because combined with a super cheap plan through Virgin Mobile, I'm happy.
Had this phone for a month it is a great buy! Definitely worth double than the price I got on here $170. Phone works great, call clarity is pretty good (better than my iphone), speakers are freaking loud (almost as loud as my laptop), the camera is amazing took some photos at work and the 13 megapixel camera kicks ass! Below is a photo I took at work the other day! The phone is exactly the same size of the large iPhone 6, for a big guy this phone finally feels right in my hands! OHHH and the kicker, most of the cases for this phone are pretty cheap and great quality!<br/><br/>P.S. phone charge is about a day with heavy use, power saver doesn't make a huge difference. The phone also syncs with google +, google accounts, and google docs so as a student I am always up to date!
HTC calls this phone a "flagship mid-level" phone and I would have to agree. This thing is fast and butter smooth. I upgraded from the Galaxy S3 that I only had for 6 months or so because whenever there is a new HTC phone I have to try it. The build quality is second to none. Yes, the screen is huge and the slightest bit cumbersome but when youre sitting around killing time on Netflix its worth it. Speaking of killing time, the Boomsound speakers on either end are awesome for listening to music. I find myself just turning Pandora on the phone, placing it on the kitchen counter and doing the dishes. No need for a Bluetooth speaker now... If you like having a very nice phone with almost all the features of the actual flagship but dont mind a few cut corners to keep the price reasonable this phone is an exellent choice. A big beautiful screen, good sound for music and video, a 13MP rear and 5MP front camera with a quad-core processor and 1.5GB or RAM make this the perfect phone for someone not wanting to drop $500-$600 on a One or S5. Im in love.
I've had this phone for 2 weeks now. I was in the market for a new phone -- a worthy upgrade to my Galaxy S3. After much research and stumbling across this HTC at an UNBELIEVABLE  price, I feel like I got away with a steal!<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>*720P display with enough pixel density to look amazing and sharp. Colors are well balanced, not over saturated like the Super Amoleds can be. Videos and photos have clarity and pop IMO.<br/><br/>*Performance is solid. Barely a hiccup. I was skeptical about the 1.5GB of RAM but that little half of a RAM really does give the phone an extra boost! Average tasks are a breeze. It also holds up good when multi-tasking. Thanks also to the quad processor.<br/><br/>*The cameras are awesome! You really see the quality in the 13 megapixel back and 5 megapixel front. And by the way, most high-end phones on the market right now do NOT have a 5 megapixel front facing camera. I'm a smartphone geek and I have to say there are less than a handful of phones out right now that have a front facing camera as good as the Desire 816. #SelfieCity<br/><br/>*The phone's design with the double speaker grills give it a unique identity. So many phones look alike these days that it's nice when companies think of the subtle ways to make their phones look different. Also, I had an Apple loyalist friend of mine coincidentally pick up my phone yesterday and marvel at "how light" it felt. I have no gripes about the weight and size.<br/><br/>Now to the CONS ... Yes, there are a couple minor ones...<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>*Like another reviewer experienced, my battery life doesn't live up to the benchmark tests, including the video drain tests. I've even seen professional reviews that say it can last you to the next day without recharging. I use my phones a little above average. My screen is cranked up to 100%, I have live wallpaper, and a few widgets running. The most I get out of my phone on a typical day with no charging is roughly 8-10 hours. This is better than any other phone I've ever had, but not as stellar as I thought in terms of battery life. However, I'm more than grateful the battery is strong.<br/><br/>*Internal memory leaves a lot to be desired. I don't have room for all my apps with the 8GB of storage and only 50 pics I've snapped so far. I've never had a phone that required I delete stuff to shore up enough space to download a new app. Get a micro SD card asap! I need one myself. (Note: it supports up to 128GB which rocks but I doubt I will do even half of that because they cost so much.)<br/><br/>My final impression is you can't go wrong on this phone. It has solid mid-range specs but a nice big screen size which is typically associated with high-end phones. It's a blessing to be so cheap for such good quality AND to be able to use for a cheap prepaid rate. I feel good I waited and thoroughly researched my options before finding this phone. Did I mention how great the price is??? ;-)
Awesome phone.  I'm glad I waited and did not buy the LG volt.  This has better specs and It can take a micro ad 128gb.
I don't get the latest greatest phones, so for around $200.00 this was a good deal. The screen is large, the camera and video work great. While a fairly big phone the weight is very light. The processor in this phone is very snappy. I have no lag between actions. I recently forgot to plug it in overnight, waking up the next day I was very concerned as my last phone (Samsung Galaxy 3) always ran out of charge if I didn't plug it in overnight, much to my amazement, only about 2% of the battery had drained. Excellent battery life!<br/>I had a HTC thunderbolt a few years back and have always loved the quality of their phones.<br/>PRO's<br/>Excellent Battery life<br/>Excellent Camera and video<br/>Excellent performance<br/><br/>CON's<br/>None I can think of
Camera quality, storage capacity(with sd card), no-contract plan, mobile hotspot capabilities, screen size, CPU speed... everything about this phone exceeds my expectations.<br/><br/>I bought it a year ago for $189.00, now I see the price has been reduced.<br/><br/>This phone works with "SMART COVERS"... The case turns on the screen automatically when you flip it open and turns the screen off automatically when you close the case.<br/><br/>UPDATE:  Finally!!!!! I found a "BATTERY CASE" for the HTC Desire 816.  It's a 4000mAh protective battery case(for a total of 6600mAh when added to the 2600mAh of the desires 816 battery).  I added a photo to my review of the case/phone.  I had to order it from China, it took 2 weeks to get here.  I ordered it from "MugenPower" website ($89.50 plus free shipping).  Just google "Mugenpower HTC desire 816" to find it.
I've had this phone for a few weeks, and it is fantastic. It is super smooth and fast, nothing can slow this thing down.  It has a great 13MP camera in the back, you'll be hard pressed to find a smartphone that comes with a better camera.  The front camera is amazingly high-quality as well. The screen looks great (c'mon, who needs 1080p on a screen this size?), and it feels great in your hand. The battery life is good: when it's sitting in your pocket it consumes hardly any battery, unlike my old phone.<br/><br/>I've put this through a variety of rigorous tests: recording 50 minutes of HD video, playing an advanced 3D game, getting directions on the fly, even dropping it from a short height.  It passed all of them with near perfection.  Of course I did see some serious battery drain on the video and game, but that's to be expected and it still lasted through the day.<br/><br/>The only downside is that it's a little big, and while it still fits in my jeans pocket it takes up all the space.  But that's a small price to pay given that it's a great phone in all other areas and only costs $200.<br/><br/>There isn't much internal storage space, but a 32GB microSD card will take care of that for only $18.  Then you'll probably want to protect your screen from falls and scratches without adding bulk, I recommend a tempered glass screen protector which can be had for around $13.
HTC DESIRE 816<br/><br/>The HTC Desire 816 is a great phone but is not for everyone due to its size. It is described as the "mid-range flagship" by HTC which is a very fitting description. It is fast, has a great screen, enough juice to get most users through the day and enough style to satisfy.<br/><br/>DESIGN<br/><br/>The 816 is designed much in the same vein as the One M7 and M8 (HTC's flagship phones) but lacks the metal to make it truly premium. Plastic is used here but in a unoffensive way. The body is two pieces, shiny plastic on the back and matte plastic around the rim and on the front. The slim profile and iconic front facing "boomsound" speakers cause the 816 to look quite good. Many users (myself included} slap a case on their phone so the thickness and build materials may become less important. For some the size of the phone will be the deciding factor. Not buying this phone because of this is completely fair. It is without a doubt a "phablet." However, for me the extra real estate was worth it.<br/><br/>The large screen impressed me. I was wary of purchasing a phone with a 5.5 inch 720p screen (267ppi) because most flagship phones boast higher resolutions. But I am quite impressed with this display. The lower pixel density will not be noticeable unless you hold it side by side with a much nicer screen. I found it to be just as nice as using an iPhone 5 display despite the iPhone having a ppi of 326.<br/><br/>FEATURES<br/><br/>The average consumer will find nothing lacking here. The 816 has all of the features one could want: panorama and HDR camera setting, NFC, great speakers, 4G LTE, blinkfeed, a micro SD slot, as well as much more. If one is more tech savvy there are plenty of options for customization as well. HTC does a grat job of not over saturating the android experience (as Samsung does) while providing enough features not included in stock android.<br/><br/>The cameras on the 816 contain some of its best features. The rear facing 13.0 MP shooter provides enough detail for most situations. As always low light shots are less than ideal. They end up being either noisy of too dark. For the price however this beats other photos I've seen on comparable phones hands down. The front facing camera is certainly sufficient at 5 MP. All of the features such as HDR work quite well. It was also great of HTC to include the option to use the volume rocker to snap pictures since the phone's size can be unwieldy at times for snapping pics.<br/><br/>PERFORMANCE<br/><br/>Simply put, this performs like a flagship phone. Don't expect to wait while switching between apps or opening the camera, etc. There is little to no lag while browsing the internet or scrolling between home screens. The only place a little lag was present was in snapping pictures which was sometimes slower than on a true flagship such as the iPhone 5S.<br/><br/>The big screen makes the 816 beg to have games played on it. Most games can run perfectly well. There are several YouTube videos showcasing this with games such as Dead Trigger 2.<br/><br/>Battery performance is sufficient. This is possibly the least impressive aspect of the 816 but not an aspect which should degrade from the overall rating. It should last a full day with moderate use. If you need to watch Netflix all day with the screen at 100% brightness (which is quite bright) you may need to invest in an external battery. For my needs the battery has done the job.<br/><br/>All in all I am more than content with the HTC Desire 816. I am sure it will be taking up an most of my pocket space for quite some time. Rating: 5 out of 5 stars.
i wish i could give this phone a good review cause i do like it, it seems fast and sturdy but there is one huge deal breaker for me.  The phone (as far as i know) only comes in the 8GB model, which would probably be enough for me if 8GB was what you actually had.  BUT no it comes with 4.5 GB of bloatware, so after downloading the essentials, i have less than a GB for apps.  And yes i bought a 32 GB SD card, but almost none of the apps are transferable.  Really sleazy move by the company that made the phone go from an easy A rating to an F.  Very dissapointed.
I've had this phone for about four months now and overall it is a really great phone, especially for the price.<br/>First off, the battery life is amazing. I can go into work at 8 AM, listen to music all day, play games and check social media during my lunch break, and still have over 60% battery by the time I get off of work at 4 PM. Even with heavy usage I typically still have about 20-30% battery by the time I go to sleep. My old iPhone would be dead even before I left work.<br/>Next, the size of this screen has ruined me from ever going back to a smaller phone. I actually laughed when I first saw how big this phone is, but it very quickly grew on me. If you have smaller hands then it may be a bit difficult trying to type with just one hand, but the size and quality of the screen are definitely worth it.<br/>With the incredible sound quality (this phone has something called Boom Sound) and the great graphics on the larger screen, it's much more comfortable to stream videos when compared to most other phones.<br/><br/>I have three complaints about this phone, which is why I gave it four stars.<br/>1. HTC's website boasts that this phone is a "photo lover's dream." It's not. The camera can be disappointing. Unless you are outside during the day or in a room with great lighting, the pictures are very subpar. The flash does nothing to improve the photos in low-light situations.<br/>2. This phone only has 8 GB of internal storage. An additional storage card will absolutely be necessary. This phone will take up to a 128 GB microSD card.<br/>3. There is only one lock button. Which means this one button is the only way to turn your phone on or off, or to unlock the screen for use. If this button ever stops working, you're out of luck. I purchased a magnetic cover case for this phone which unlocks the screen whenever I open the cover. The only time I ever have to touch the lock button is when I need to restart my phone.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great phone and I would recommend it to anyone looking to make the switch to Virgin Mobile.
I love this phone. Its fast and smooth. Perfect size for me and of course very inexpensive. I suggest investing in a screen protector :)
The size (it is big) and the design of the front, with the matte texture on front and around the sides looks premium, definitely an eye catcher. The back, no so much. A pale grey, glossy fingerprint magnet. No matter, slap on a cheap (price wise, quality case) Noot Basic case like I did, which is also matte, really compliments the phone, and it looks fantastic. Your friends will be jealous for sure. Would've rather had a protective case, but no otterbox support, and all the available knockoff ones for this phone look cheap, and I prefer to keep the premium look and feel of the phone with a slim case. Also I recommend you slap on a tempered glass screen protector as well. That combo makes the phone looks super classy high end.<br/><br/>The power button, although in an unusual place (top left), is easy to get used to, and the "normal" placement on other phone now feels a bit weird to me. It's all muscle memory. But that and the volume rocker are quite wobbly and lack that  reassuring "click" response on most other phones like my old moto g. But not a big deal.<br/><br/>The screen is big. Not too big, just right. This is my first "phablet" and I really don't see myself ever going back to a "regular" size phone. 5.5", at 720p HD. Looks fantastic. Not the sharpest, but more than sharp enough, and colors look a bit washed out (not as vibrant) when put side by side to the moto g, but a great looking screen nonetheless.<br/><br/>This uses the same CPU chipset as the moto g, but it's clocked faster (1.6Ghz vs 1.2), and has more ram (1.5gb vs 1gb). And honestly it makes a huge difference. Unlike the moto g, and pretty much all phones with 1gb or less, with that extra RAM you can have several apps in the background, and open them up right back up, without them having to reload. And the higher clock speed means the screen feels much more responsive, apps open and close much faster, and scrolling on the web or on facebook is much more smooth. The only "lag" I've noticed with general use is sometimes swiping through homescreens can feel sluggish. Not sure why, even with no apps running and Blinkfeed turned off. Maybe it's just my device, but not a big deal.<br/>The GPU that comes with the chipset isn't the best, graphics intensive games are playable, but I wouldn't call it smooth. But casual games (candy crush, temple run, etc) run fine. All and all, performance wise, gaming is basically what you'd expect for the price, but general use is dare I say almost comparable to flagship phones I've messed with. Real smooth.<br/><br/>The cameras are flagship worthy. No doubt about it. My moto G had a 5 megapixel primary camera. The FRONT camera on this phone is 5 megapixels, and the back matches some flagships at 13 MP. Sure, MP count isn't everything, it's the quality of the sensor. But HTC didn't slouch. Pictures taken outside in good light blow away any other phone in this price range. Low light shots are exceptional as well, no other ~300$ off contract phone can touch this phones camera quality.<br/><br/>If you're a spec person and have looked into this phone you've probably seen that NFC is only on certain models. This model DOES have NFC. Very good to see.<br/><br/>It also runs on 4G LTE. If you're used to a 3G only phone, the data speeds crazy fast, no more youtube buffering, it's night and day.<br/><br/>Saving the best feature for last, as a music lover, the front facing Boomsound speakers are ridiculous. At half volume, it's loud enough for a room. And at full volume, it fills my friend's apartment. And it's not just loud, it's clear, not "tinny" in the least bit like every other phone out there with a single speaker, it's produces a full sound and it actually has some bass to it! No need for an external bluetooth speaker. And there's two speakers, so it's stereo, hold it in landscape while watching a music video or movie and you get that full, left to right sound experience. Pair that with the big nice screen and the media experience is just amazing.<br/><br/>All in all, this a a fantastic phone, and even better is the price. You get fast, smooth performance, on a big, great looking screen. Cameras near worthy of a flagship. And HTCs trademark front facing Boomsound speakers. All for about 180$ on amazon. No doubt the best phone Virgin Mobile offers that's not 600+$, and a really great phone in general. No, don't get the LG Volt, the kyocera, don't get the cheaper htc desire 510 (cousin has it, it's crap), get this. I promise you'll love it. You can't go wrong, there's no better value for your money.
I have had this phone for about 3 months now, and am finally ready to discuss.<br/><br/>This is one of the best phones I've used. I have compared it with Iphones, Samsung Galaxies, and Nokias - all much more expensive, but they barely measure up. I urge you to give this phone a try over any other phone on Virgin's network. You will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>I still can not believe the amount of phone I got for the money. I have never been one for the latest-and-greatest electronics, wait a while, and you'll have a better time figuring out what you're getting. This phone has met all my expectations, and beyond.<br/><br/>THE PROS:<br/>--- The screen is large and crisp, colors are saturated. Beautiful. The glass seems to resist finger prints exceptionally well.<br/>--- Navigation, quick-access settings and notifications are very easily and quickly accessible. So very easy to use.<br/>--- The camera is pretty neat, although you do have to get used to the shutter speed. Camera allows for some manual adjustments. Picture quality is as good, if not better, than my friend's Iphone 5.<br/>--- Sturdy, without being heavy. The finish feels soft and smooth. I absolutely do not agree with those who say it feels cheap. It's great: no fingerprints, doesn't slip out easily. However, I can not judge the durability of the plastic: I slapped a case on the phone within a week of receiving it (just because I'm paranoid about that beautiful screen.)<br/>--- Stand-by battery time is incredible. If all I do is make a few calls, send a few texts, and sit on facebook for an hour, all in one day, the battery will last me for at least two full days. If I play some games on top of that, the battery time goes down to a day and a half, but still covers two full work days. If you're smart with your phone, and disable background app refreshing, close out of apps you are not using, and only keep wi-fi on while using it, you can really make it last.<br/>The battery saver option in fantastic. I've had it keep the last 5% of the charge going for almost five hours with minimal use (a few texts here and there). Impressive.<br/>--- The speakers are truly mind-blowing. Never have I heard phone speakers like these. The sound is surprisingly clear, seeing as the speakers are so very little. On full volume, the phone's speakers are almost twice as loud as the speakers on my Lenovo V570 laptop at full volume. Very impressive.<br/>--- Call quality is also great, I haven't had a dropped call once, and I can hear those I talk to very clearly, even when I'm on campus with relatively poor reception.<br/>--- The size is good. I have pretty small hands (for a 5'6 female) so it took me a while to figure out how to hold and navigate the phone efficiently without risking dropping it. After two days I got it figured out and I could not be happier with the size. The screen size is fantastic when using a navigation app: not too big where it's ditracting, but also not so small that you can't read the street name.<br/>--- HTC's CAR app is also quite great. It gives you quick and easy access to things you may need on the road, while also minimizing the distractions.<br/><br/>THE CONS:<br/>--- Battery life really struggles when it comes to watching videos. Watching a 35 minute video with speakers turned all the way up drained about 40% of my battery. That is the worst I believe it really gets. Doesn't bother me much though. I don't usually use my phone for streaming videos, and when I do it's while cleaning the house, doing dishes, or cooking, which requires the speakers to be turned up quite a bit.<br/>--- The speakers loose some of their clean sound when watching something with prevalent white noise, such as some nature shows, and shows with applause.<br/><br/>That's really the only relatively bad things I have to say about this phone, and they are truly trivial. This thing is AMAZING.
Though not state-of-the-art, this phone delivers! Graphics aren't super-crisp, but they're fine, and the screen is huge. The built-in speakers are amazing for vocals and higher-pitched sounds (don't expect much for bass or drums). The 4G LTE speed is not blazing, but it can stream songs from Google Play and videos from YouTube effortlessly. It comes with a recent version of KitKat, which gives a very smooth user interface experience.I really like it and would buy it again.
Not sure this is brand new product or just a refurbish product. Look ok but first things when I use this the camera got problem with flash. If I take photo with flash then the photo become blue and cannot see any details. Cannot use flash anyway.
I used to be a Work at Home Customer Service Agent for Virgin Mobile, and have been a loyal Virgin Mobile customer ever since.  I am sorry but I just don't understand paying the high contract monthly bills when I can get great phones like this and only pay $55 a month for Unlimited talk, text, and data.<br/><br/>I purchased my phone from a shop at home TV channel, on a flex pay plan.  I LOVE THIS PHONE!!!  It has a full 13mp rear facing camera, and 5MP front facing camera.  Most phone only give you 5MP on the back. And it takes AWSOME pictures.  It has a 5.5" screen. The shop at home channel calls it a Phablet.  I dont know if I would go that far, but with Amazon now coming out with a 6in Fire HD tablet I guess you could.  I have had it for almost a month and I dont know everything the damn thing does.  The battery life is awsome.  I probably go about a day and a half without having to charge it, and thats with pretty good usage.<br/><br/>I have a home phone in my office, as well as a business line.  I had to do some faxing recently and plugged my home phone line into my fax.  I never took it out, because now I only use my cell phone.  Seriously thinking of discontinuing my home phone service altogether.  I had the $35 a month plan  which only gives you 200 talk minutes, but you still get unlimited text and data. Since I have a phone line I didnt talk much on my cell.  For a recent vacation I upped my talk plan to Unlimited for the extra $20 per month since I was sure to need more talk time, but left it at that plan once I came back.  Thats what I love about Virgin Mobile.  You are not locked in to how much you wanna talk.  Say your budget only allows for you to have the $35 plan, but you're going home for Christmas and need to use your phone more.  Add an extra 20 bucks for that month, and you're at unlimited talk.  When you come back, change it back to stick to your budget.<br/><br/>The one con I have with Virgin Mobile phones is that you are locked into only purchasing dedicated Virgin Mobile phones.  No Sim Cards, however, THIS PHONE, does have an actual removable Sim Card.  At this point I am not sure if I could get a T-Mobile sim Card under their Bring you own phone plan  but the fact that the sim card is removable, suggests its possible to take it to another carrier.  But I am not leaving Virgin Mobile to find out.<br/><br/>It does seem to have a lot of bloatware installed, which is why I dont know exactly what all it can do, but you can customize the phone to only show the apps you want to use.  Thats another reason I dont know what all it does, because I hid the crap I dont use. And the Beats speakers are AWESOME-SAUCE!!  This is my 2nd HTC phone both having Beats brand Stereo speaker, which is the main reason I so wanted this phone when I saw it.<br/><br/>And as always, before I made the ultimate decision to purchase the phone I came to Amazon to make sure there was a case available.  I purchased the HTC Desire 816, E LV HTC Desire 816 Deluxe PU Leather Wallet / Purse Case Cover for HTC Desire 816 with 1 Stylus and 1 E-LV Microfiber Digital Cleaner.

I have been thinking about a phablet for quite awhile and have been researching them extensively.  I was looking for a no contract phone,  and had been looking at the Boost ZTE  Max.  Then as I was watching TV last weekend I happened upon QVC when they were showing the HTC Desire 816 and I was hooked!  I immediately checked to see if Amazon had it and they do, for $10 cheaper so I ordered it.  Am I glad I found it....it is a fantastic phone!!  I wanted a phablet because of the larger size, the old eyes aren't what they use to be, and I find the 5.5" screen is perfect.  The build quality is very nice, it doesn't feel cheap at all and it feels great in my hand.  It offers so much more than the Boost Max and is much less expensive.  Everything about it works great, it is quad core so it is super fast.  The speakers are unbelieveable, crisp, clear and loud.  The screen is also great, crisp and clear, hd.  Apps download fast with no problem.  There is no lag at all.  The battery life is terrific, I have been using it for 2 days, heavily and haven't had to charge it yet.  It had to be fully charged when it first arrived and it charged in about 3-4 hours.  Activation to Virgin Mobil was a breeze, took about 15 minutes.  I chose the $35 a month plan with 300 minutes of talk time and unlimited text and data.  Can't beat that!  And I chose auto pay so I don't need to worry about when to pay each month, it is done automatically.  I am thrilled with my new phone/phablet.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is in the market for a phablet or is looking to upgrade to a high end phone.  Do not hesitate this is a fabulous choice!
I like the phone. I was initially concerned about it's size, since I was used to a smaller phone. It took about a week for the phone to "shrink down" and not feel awkward anymore, in other words, I got used to it and now it feels weird when I pick up my old phone. The added real estate makes a world of difference to an old foggy like me, who wakes up every morning with a little less eyesight and a little less hair.<br/>As others have mentioned, the sound quality is amazing for such a small device. Now, it's not a heart stopping "boom box" by any stretch of the imagination, but it sounds great for what it is.<br/>It has a brilliant display from every angle. I have not seen a phone any clearer or sharper at any price.<br/>The cameras are pretty good. I've always had cameras on my cell phones, but I hardly ever used them because I'm a hobby photographer and I don't shoot with anything less than a DSLR. However, I can see myself taking pictures with this one from time to time. Coming from me, that's a compliment. There are better cameras on other phones, but there is nothing wrong with the pictures or video this one can take.<br/>HTC has an app that is installed on this phone. It's some live tile application that keeps feeding you whatever you customize it to do. As aforementioned, I'm not a 12 year old girl, so I have no interest in any "social" media apps. I don't care who is doing what, or who said what when. Therefore, I found this app to be annoying and it took me a while to figure out how to get rid of it. If you live and breathe "social" media, you will love this.<br/>This phone is for Virgin mobile only. It's a great service for a great price, however, they use the Sprint network, which doesn't have that great a coverage.<br/>I don't know what a more expensive phone can do, compared to this one, but I'm certain that whatever it is, I don't need it and it's not worth an extra $400 to me. This is a quality phone with a thin and sleek design. Don't tell HTC, but I think this phone is worth far more than what I paid for it.<br/>I didn't give it 5 stars because of the HTC in your face app and because it only comes with 8 gigs of storage, 4 of which is already used up by the OS and by the bloat ware that comes installed on it. I got a 32 gig micro SD to remedy this problem and I highly recommend getting one if you plan on purchasing this phone.
So far so good.  It's my first day using it so time will tell.  Day one included an easy set up on-line at Virgin Mobile site.  Contacts migrated simply just by logging into Google (although Google was missing a few for some unknown reason, so I did the blue tooth sync with my prior phone to get the rest and then it had a selection to automatically delete any duplicates).<br/><br/>Display is clear, audio speakers strong, and phone use audio clarity (tested both receiving and speaking from the Desire 816) is excellent.  Display is sharp with select-response time better than I've experienced with my two prior Androids.  My prior phone was the LG Optimus F3 4G LTE with a 4 inch display; and this 5.5 is noticeably more like a tablet, but it's still easy to hold and use as a phone.  I don't regret that larger size which makes for great internet surfing.  And it fits well in my pocket -- not as much of a difference in handling as I had anticipated.
I upgraded to this phone from an HTC EVO 3D last month and I love it. One of the best, if not the best pre-paid phone on the market. The price (especially here on Amazon) certainly beats the $600 you would need to shell out for an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy, and performance is very comparable. At 6.17" by 3.1", it took a while to get used the size of this phone. It is very close to small tablet territory, but still fits in my pocket comfortably. Below I have broken down this phone into 5 basic categories and included additional details for review of how I graded the phone.<br/><br/>Display, Audio and Camera: 5 stars<br/><br/>The screen on this phone is remarkable, and the camera is better than any I've ever owned (including stand alone digital cameras). The screen is 5.5" and only 720p, but do you really notice the difference between 720 and 1080 on a small device such as this. Images are crystal clear and colors are vibrant. The touch screen is super responsive and due to the larger size it is much easier to type on this phone compared to my old one. The 13 MP rear camera is capable of filming in 1080p which is nice in case you ever want to view your pictures/videos on a larger display like a computer or tv. I have not yet used the front facing 5 MP camera, but it's nice to know it's there in case I would ever want to use skype, facetime, etc. The speakers on this phone are really good. The Boomsound speakers on this phone are the same as the ones on the more expensive HTC One M8. They are not the best I've ever heard on a cell phone, but they are pretty close and are better than the speakers on some laptops. Music, audio for videos, and calls are loud and clear. I am very satisfied with the audio and video performance of this phone.<br/><br/>Operating System, Apps, and Storage: 4.5 stars<br/><br/>The phone comes pre-loaded with Android Kit Kat, HTC Sense 6, all the normal Virgin Mobile bloatware, and a few other useful third party apps. I've found the combination of Kit Kat and HTC Sense 6 to be quite user friendly and intuitive. I believe the phone will eventually be able to be upgraded to the Lollipop release of Android, as the specs are there for it, but whether Virgin and HTC allow it or not is another story. Either way the out of box OS and user interface is good and should be suitable for new users as well as experienced Android users. The Virgin bloatware is a pain and cannot be uninstalled. I guess this is a necessary evil in exchange for affordable, quality service as they insist on installing it on pretty much all of their phones. Some of the preloaded third party apps are quite nice. I particularly like the FM Radio receiver built into the phone combined with the Next Radio app which I now use more often than the iHeartRadio app. Also I was not a fan of HTC Blinkfeed at first, but now that I've had the phone for a while and taken the time to customize it,this feature it is actually quite useful. After all the pre-installed Software/Apps, you have about 6 of 8 GB of on-board storage left on the phone to add your own apps from the Android Play store which is by far the largest and most robust of all App stores in my opinion. It's a good thing the phone can take up to a 128 GB MicroSD card, and more and more developers are allowing their apps to be ported over to SD storage or otherwise I would have issue with only 8 GB of on-board storage. Another note regarding storage and a nice perk with this phone is a free upgrade to 100 GB of space on Google Drive.<br/><br/>Physical Design/Feel of Phone: 5 stars<br/><br/>The phone is big as I mentioned above, but at 5.82 oz it is surprisingly light, well balanced, and it fits comfortably in my hand. The outer shell is a smooth hard plastic very similar to the stuff they use for the Samsung Galaxy phones. The power and volume buttons are on the top, left side of the phone. I am left handed and love this as they are very easy for me to control with my left thumb while holding the phone in my left hand and talking. There is not a physical home/menu button on the phone, but there are digital buttons on the bottom touch screen that do the same thing. Some people have complained about this, but I actually don't mind it at all. The screen itself is Corning Gorilla Glass 2, and is supposed to be scratch proof. Overall I think this phone has a great design and feel. A lot of expert reviews I've read compare the design to an iPhone 5C but larger and running Android.<br/><br/>Battery: 4 stars<br/><br/>Speaking of the iPhone, one of the major issues that I do have with this phone is that like the iPhone, the battery is embedded and cannot be removed or replaced. This scares me, and almost stopped me from purchasing this phone. So far I am glad I was able to move past it, because I really do like this phone otherwise. Battery life so far has been great, and the battery charges back up pretty fast as well. So far there have been no issues here. Hopefully it stays that way since there is no way to replace the battery if it does become a problem.  This is my lowest scoring category for the phone because of the lack of options if the battery ever does become a problem, but so far so good.<br/><br/>Service: 5 stars<br/><br/>$45/ month for unlimited talk, text and data. Need I say more? Coverage is very good everywhere I've been in the US. Virgin uses Sprint's network so you can pretty much get phone service and at least 3g data speeds anywhere. This is a 4g LTE phone and the speed of data on this band where available is impressively fast. My previous phone was 4g Wimax, which is also fast, and LTE is noticeably faster to me. Lastly the phone is on a CDMA network so it may not be ideal for international use. That being said it does have all the hardware needed to be used on a GSM network so with a little tinkering, and some determination I'm sure it could be unlocked if the need arose.<br/><br/>I hope anybody thinking about buying this phone finds my review helpful. I personally love this phone, but I understand all people are different so I tried to be as fair/unbiased as possible while writing this. Many thanks for reading!
I've only had this phone less than a week but I love it so far. I had the galaxy s2 prior to this phone and I was very skeptical because it was so new to this company so there wasn't many reviews yet... But I'm glad I took a chance because it's nice and thin with huge screen, it runs very smoothly and surprisingly isn't too hard to hold (and I have small hands) it may not be top of the line like the s 5 or whatever but I think it's pretty darn good especially for the price because virgin mobile charges 100 bucks more on their website. I was close to gettin the s3 because I was already familiar with the galaxies and liked them but most of the specs were better on this phone so I figured it can't be that bad. Some people may say the screen quality isn't top notch but I find it to be just fine, not a big noticeable difference In my opinion. It's the first phone I've had that I couldn't remove the battery so I'm still nervous to see what happens if it freezes. It's definitely not a phone you would want to use without a case because the back is super glossy plastic like material that looks like it could be scratch prone, but its not bad looking. The only thing that I have to complain about so far is that it's impossible to find a variety of cases in the U.S. for it.. I'm guessing since its so new yet?
Phone works great, but there is some serious problems with the sync software from htc. Called htc about face unlock not showing up after update. They said i needed to download this crap. I did and I created a restore point before I installed the software. After installing it it would not see my phone. It did see it before installing it. Then my phone kept dinging. I un-installed the software and went to system restore and all my restore points were gone. I checked to make sure they were there before creating this point - (BEFORE HTC SYNC). Called htc and they said it was a windows problem and not theirs. Call Microsoft? Why? This all happened because they do NOT test their software.<br/>If you buy one - do NOT use htc sync.
I love this phone.
Bought myself this phone hoping I wouldn't need my reading glasses anymore. So far, so go. Some apps are still really small like the online free poker. So be it. Can only find accessories online so might as well buy them all together. Have to buy a hip case to get the ear plugs. Be aware that some of the products add to the number to Purchase on their own. (Unless my phone is hacked already.)<br/><br/>States battery last up to 7 days. Guess that's IF you don't do anything but phone calls. I run my battery down in 4-5 hours and that's with the battery saver on. I'm still trying to figure everything out.<br/><br/>Beware that warrenty doesn't go through on cart if you edit something. $100 deductable AND $7 a month. Just put that money in savings to buy your own. Talked to Virgin Mobile and they stated they do cover the very limited 1 yr manufacture warrenty but that's it. Their extended warrenty has simular terms.
it's a stellar phone, super fast with an amazing camera, its flaw for me is that it's really big.<br/>that might be a plus to a lot of people but it just won't fit properly in my hands or in my pockets.<br/>i would absolutely recommend to someone who likes big phones.
This phone is THE high end phone for a mid range price on Virgin Mobile. There is no comparison when it comes to the bang for your buck that you receive when buying this phone. There is not a single specification of this phone that jumps out as "mid range phone" level components, or memory/speed amounts (of ram, processor core speed, some may want more than 8gbs of internal memory, but throw a 64gb card in there like I did and you're good to go.) Believe me when I tell you, if you're looking for an android based device for a paltry 35 dollar a month prepaid, zero penalty plan, then look no further. This phone will handle whatever you may want through at it, and with great ease. I bought mine for $170, if you can get it for under 200, and meet the criteria above, you've found your phone, you will not regret it. Great job HTC, if I was gonna finally make the jump from my beloved physical keyboard slider style phone, I'm glad it's this device I made that big jump to. Only thing that could make it better in my opinion is a removable battery, and a slide out keyboard, although HTC appears long done with them, shame that it is.
I have had this cell phone for about a week and can find no flaws.  The shipping was fast, and the sim card was good.  It was easy to change my previous Virgin Cell phone account to switch phones to my new one.  The phone is big, but then again when watching Youtube and stuff the size of the screen does matter.  Amazon also offered this phone for approx. $100.00 less than Virgin, and at a cheaper price than ebay. The price on Amazon is an amazing deal.<br/><br/>The only problem I encountered was that the bottom of the package where the serial numbers are, ect., someone had drawn black lines through the numbers so that the numbers were a little hard to read upon registering on Virgin.  But the Virgin website also has a feature that can tap into the sim card within the phone.  There was no problem, the sim card was recognized and the standard Virgin warrenty was offered at no charge (although I did purchase the one year warranty plan on the Amazon page).  This is an exceptional deal to purchase a great phone!
I just got my hands on this wonderful phone I normally shop on here for most of my electronics but not this time anyways this 5.5 super LCD display,Android Version 5.0.2 Lollipop,HTC Sense 6.0,3G/4G LTE,HTC BlinkFeed & HTC BoomSound 1.6 GHz Quad-Core Processor & HTC Zoe,I mean this phone is worth way more then the asking price and the 13MP rear camera and the bomb 5MP front facing camera that's way better the a lot of so call high end phone's this is a great buy but shop around first,you might find a great bundle else where ya heard me...
AWESOME!  I switched from galaxy s3 to try a larger screen. This phone is even better than I expected. Extremely fast and the 5.5 screen is beautiful. And the biggest surprise was I ordered it from Amazon at 7 pm on a Friday evening, and it arrived at my door at 8 am Saturday !  I never owned an HTC before. I have put this phone thru my own 'phone test' and it passed with flying colors. Great battery life also. For those people that want a sharp looking and fast phone, this is it!
Okay, I was a bit sceptical of this phone.  I have always had good luck with HTC in the past but this phone just seemed to good to be true.  However, this phone is possibly the best phone I have ever used.  I had a Samsung Galaxy S3 just before getting the HTC Desire.  I loved the S3, but the micro USB port gave out after three years so I looked at getting another phone and found this one on Amazon.  The Desire is amazing, it is faster than the S3, has a much larger screen, the camera is incredible, and the front facing stereo speakers are the best I have ever heard on a cell phone.  This phone is totally worth the purchase price!  I recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a wicked cool phone.
I got the htc desire 601 in February and I enjoyed that phone. I saw this phone and the size is what made me buy it, but this phone is amazing. The main camera and front camera alone are better than the htc desire 601, which only had 5mp for the main camera and 1mp for the front camera. This phone is just an overall upgrade in performance compared to my old phone!<br/><br/>Shipping was very quick and on time.<br/>I adore this phone!<br/>One drawback is the selection for cases is horrible (not just on amazon) and I have to wait until next month to get both of my cases that I ordered when I ordered my phone.
You cant go wrong with this phone for this price. I was tired of my small Iphone and didnt want to shell out a ton of money for the Iphone 6 because it seems like every new Iphone is only slightly better then the last. It had been years since ive had an adroid phone and i wasnt sure if id like the os. Turns out I love it, if you take the time to explore it and learn a few things, you can do alot more then you ever could do on ios. Some of the simpler things I like is the ability to easily take a screenshot on your phone and being able to hide the app icons you dont use. Ill try to keep this rundown short:<br/>1. Build & Design<br/>The phone is huge, but you get used to it, I promise. It feels sturdy even those its plastic. The back is a huge fingerprint magnet so I suggest putting it in a case. (You will not find one in a store. I had to search amazon and found a cheap one from china. Took forever to get but it was actually fantastic, even has a kickstand)<br/>2. Speakers<br/>two rows of front facing speakers. Best in sound quality ive ever heard from a phone.<br/>3. Calls and data<br/>Its hard to discern if a phone handles call quality better then another because your network signal plays the biggest role. I will say, vs my old Iphone 5s on the same service, in areas with the same signal strength, ive had less dropped calls and clearer call quality with this phone. As for data, the iphone would sometimes pick up lte and the speeds were great. Im not sure if the Desire is enabled to do so, ive only noticed 3g. Videos and gifs will suffer while on the go, but nothing too horrible.<br/>4. Screen<br/>Ill never go back to smaller screens again. It may not be true hd, but its so close you dont even notice most the time. Since I got this, I havent even touched my ipad mini.<br/>5. Battery<br/>Better then my Iphone but hard to judge. Some days it seems like it drains super fast but it could be me just losing track of time because its so hard to put down.<br/>6. Camera<br/>The only thing I dont like is the camera. All my indoor pictures come out blurry, tweaking the settings doesnt seem to help much either. I was surprised because it has a 13 megapixel camera and alot of reviews say its a good camera. May just be my unit, shakey hands, poor lighting or a combination of all. Its a real bummer because I love knowing I have a camera with me incase something noteworthy happens, but so far its dissapointing. It takes a while to snap a picture too, and if the subject is in motion, forget about it.<br/>7. Apps<br/>The htc comes with a nifty set up program that can connect wirelessly to your old phone to grab contacts and such, which is great. Theres a program that goes along with your computer also to help load up music and stuff. Coming from Itunes, it wasnt as easy to get everything up and running, especially getting my itunes library onto the micro sd card. I eventually just got fed up and tried copying and pasting it onto my card and luckily my computer picked up on it and automatically changed the file types for me. The google play store is great, lots of free deals, i got a linkin park album, the 1st lord of the rings movie and a bunch of old books completely free! The amount of apps for anything you could ever wish to do is mind blowing compared to apples app store. A word of warning though, it seems like anyone can develop an app on google, and you get the feeling like some may not be safe. I had downloaded a highly rated virus scanner and after an hour my phone got super hot and the battery died. Just be careful, and if something seems off about a certain app, uninstall it to be on the safe side.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>Its a great phone, great price. I use Virgin mobile because I hate contracts and their pricing. And if I want to upgrade my phone, I pay upfront for it, but its still a better deal then how the contract companies work their plans to get the money back for those "discounted" prices. If tommorow I saw a phone i wanted, i can order it, and put it on my plan easily, no strings attached. Sure, it works off sprint towers, and my signal usually never meets Verizon or At&t; levels, but its good enough for me.
This is really a great phone. Battery life is phenomenal!!!!!!!!
Love this phone!!! I always had Samsung Galaxy products and I was debating to switch to HTC. I was about to purchase the Samsung S3, but the HTC was a little cheaper. Not only it was a better price, but it was more updated with an amazing camera!! My mom purchased it 2 weeks ago through QVC and loves it as well. I'm so glad I made the switch.<br/><br/>The only downfall is finding accessories for it. I hope OtterBox comes out with a case for it soon.<br/><br/>I ordered it on Amazon, Saturday and got it on Monday!! I'm very pleased with HTC and Amazon.
This phone is fantastic!  720p hd screen is sharp and clear, processor is very fast and 1 full GB ram for your apps.  The boomsound speakers/amp alone are a good motivation for buying this as well.  The battery lasts all day in mixed usage in power saver mode that's built-in, even has ultra-power saving mode if your in a pinch without a charger.
I've only had this phone for about a day & a half, so I may update this review as I learn more about the product.  So far, I like it.  I don't love it, but then, it's just a phone.  I still miss one of my old flip phones from many, many years ago that, ironically, cost about the same as this one (roughly $150).  It had the best reception of any cell I've ever used, bar none.  The camera was excellent, considering how long ago it was.  The phone was extremely durable as well, and had I not dropped it just one too many times & dislodged the camera lens, I'd likely still be using it.<br/>In any case, this HTC is my first personal smart phone.  I've previously had an iPhone 4 & 5C for work.  The 5C was an 8GB model, so I find this HTC phone to be fairly comparable, with one huge difference: the screen size.<br/>I've got small hands, but haven't had any issues with this monster yet.  It has taken a bit of getting used to, but I find that to be the case with any new item, when you're used to something else.  I've had more "trouble" getting used to the android way of doing things than with handling the phone itself.  But again, that's just from being completely unfamiliar with the android product line.  I do look forward to seeing what it can do.  It's a bit less intuitive than Apple's OS, but I do have to say that when I first started using the iphone 4 for work, I wanted to throw it out a window at least once a day.  We eventually reached a truce, however, and I'm hoping it will be the same with the HTC.<br/>First impressions:<br/>It's big.  Not so big that it won't (mostly) fit into a pocket, but it's quite a jump up from a 4" screen.  I'm attaching a pic of the two phones for size comparison.  The HTC will definitely stick out lengthwise from a back pocket.<br/>The ringtone choices are limited & pretty sad, but you're able to record your own, so I likely will do so.<br/>As others have said, it's got 8GB of storage, and about half that is taken up by pre-loaded software.  That seems pretty standard, however, and I'd already planned to pick up an SD card to increase space sooner rather than later.  That's not an option with the 5C (or any iphone), so that's a point in this phone's favor.<br/>Call clarity is ok, but not nearly as good as either iphone.  It's really only about as good as my current VM flip phone, which is at least 5 or 6 years old, maybe more (<br/>).  When using the HTC on speaker, however, it's terrible.  I use the speaker more often than not when talking on the phone, as I'm usually busy doing things & need my hands, so that's one thing I'm hugely disappointed with.<br/>I haven't explored many apps yet, but have not been all that impressed so far with what's included.  Most seem to require you to log into a google account in order to even see what they are, and I find that incredibly irritating.  I'm not a big fan of google, and find them highly invasive in everything they do, which is why I avoided purchasing an android phone for so long.  The app situation seems to be more of the same.  I do read on my phone a lot, so at the very least I'm going to need an app for that.  Plus, I listen to music fairly often, so I'll have to find something for that as well.  Fingers crossed.
Too many good detailed reviews, so i will just post likes/dislikes.<br/><br/>Likes:<br/>+Big good looking 5.5" screen that still fits easily in my work pants/slacks.<br/>+Built in boom sound, zoe and visual equalizers with lyrics for your music.<br/>+Plays your mp3s from your burned cds, not just official mp3s bought online.<br/>+in general: good cameras, phone features and smooth operation.<br/>+Can transfer pics and video from your sd card to built in storage and vice versa at will(only about half of the 8gb of internal storage is usable though, but most of my music and videos are on the sd card anyway.  Disclaimer: im not a heavy user of apps and i dont game on a phone)<br/><br/>Dislikes:<br/>-very heavy usage means charging daily, and it doesnt exactly charge fast.  But im usually able to charge every other day.<br/>-boom sound is good and loud close by, but it doesnt really sound that loud from a long distance to me.  other budget phones ive had sound louder from a distance.<br/>-gets kinda hot with extensive usage on certain activities to the point where i added a widget that indicates battery temp.<br/>-phone still fits in my pants, shorts, etc.  But im always worried it might break when i bend at work(manual labor).  Not exactly premium materials used(but hey its a budget phone & price at 180 with no contract)<br/><br/>Anyway, your mileage will vary with above plus & minuses.  I bought at $180(wiped out $80 in amazon credit so it ended up only costing me $100), dont regret it at all.  Months ago i was looking to upgrade to a 5" sharp aquos but virgin mobile never made that available(us vm'ers get the short stick since we are 3rd in line behind sprint prepaid and boost i guess).  But thats ok, im glad im "stuck" with this phone.  And at the rate virgin is adding new phones to its line up(which seems like forever), i would gladly buy another on sale as a backup or recommend this as an upgrade to anything but the s5.
Coming from an iphone5 with Sprint at 80 dollars a month I was looking for something more economical. I had used Virgin Mobile in the past and always thought their service was crappy but maybe it was my crappy android that was the problem a few years ago. I'm practically married and I don't need a phone with unlimited minutes and all that so I thought this was good and it is. For 35 a month I chose to get unlimited data and texting with 300 minutes cuz I hardly ever talk anyway. One month later and I don't really have any complaints. I went to the VM website and set it all up and didn't even have to talk to any annoying customer service people. You can either choose auto pay or pay manually each month and they do make it easy to understand. Anyway, on to the phone. My other half has the iphone6 plus and I have the htc 816 so I can definitely give you a hands on comparison. The quality isn't going to compare to the iphone6. The iPhone definitely feels heavier and more solid, the video quality is also better on the iPhone and the camera is definitely better. With that being said, this phone is still worth the money. The screen size is identical to the 6 plus and the sound quality is awesome as a lot of reviewers have stated. Even my girlfriend who has the iphone6 complimented the sound quality on the 816. The size is no problem either. You get used to it.<br/>Atleast from my personal experience, the apps on the phone suck. The Facebook app never loads and moves slower than molasses in January and the Youtube app wasn't too much better. So for Facebook and Youtube, I use the preinstalled google chrome browser for Facebook and Youtube and now it's lightning fast. If you're strongly anti google you may not like this phone or any android for that matter. Just be prepared to really be pressured into creating a google account. Considering I cut my phone bill in half by going to prepaid it really didn't bother me.<br/><br/>So all in all this phone is definitely worth it. I gave it only 4 stars because of the plastic build. Glossy plastic on the back of the phone is uncalled for but it's easily fixed with a case. I'm not that guy who needs the newest and best phone to look cool, but I do want something that works and this does. To wrap it up, if you're looking for something big like the iphone6 without the big price, this will do it. I promise you.
I've been very impressed with this phone, and I've gone through my fair share of mobile devices over the years. I put all my devices through their paces, modifying and customizing almost everything. My new HTC Desire 816 has held up wonderfully--so well, actually, that I've stuck with much of the out-of-the-box functions. Here are some things that have really impressed me with this phone:<br/><br/>- Battery life has exceeded my expectations. I came from a Galaxy S4, which began to overheat and chew through its battery, so I was pleasantly surprised when I could get about 36 hours of battery life from my new HTC. The sad reality with new devices is that, with more powerful processors being smooshed between thinner and thinner devices, battery life inevitably suffers. The 816's specs are just a notch below the One M8's, and luckily, this is a plus for battery life. At the end of the day, as apps get increasingly innovative, they suck more life from your battery. It just happens.<br/><br/>- Screen size. It's huge. A 5.5" screen is the same size as the iPhone 6 Plus, for reference. The immense screen is borderline unwieldy--holding the phone in one hand, it's difficult to reach the topmost corner with your thumb. It takes some getting used to, but in the end, I really appreciate the increased screen real estate. Although they never mention it, this phone falls under the "phablet" category.<br/><br/>- The Boom Sound speakers are the bread and butter of the HTC line. I can't tell you how nice it is not to have to cup my hand around a rear speaker! Why didn't anyone think of this before? The overall sound quality is fantastic as well. I'm not into listening to music without headphones, but watching videos and movies is immensely more enjoyable with front-facing speakers. Bravo, HTC.<br/><br/>I could go on, but suffice it to say that I'm very fond of this phone. Paying under $200 for a phone is a miracle notwithstanding, but when it's a solid device like the Desire 816, I'm happy.
Love this phone huge 5.5 screen, boom sound, quad core processor, 13 mp camera, NFC, and really sick. I upgraded from Galaxy s3 and love it it lasts more than double that phone for about two days of full usage. And is about 3 times faster, its basically a htc one stripped of a few features with a bigger screen... a must buy.
I purchased  this phone 4 days ago leaving  the s3 and the battery life on the desire  816 is amazing as opposed to my s3. I love this  big screen.  The graphic  is amazing. This was a great purchase. And I got it for under 200 dollars with fast shipping! Virgin Mobile did great with this one.
For the price, it's very good.<br/>Some minor glitch on using compare to Apple phones, but it is quite normal for an Android phone.<br/>I was thinking Galaxy Note 3 first, but I guess I made the right choice buying HTC Desire 816<br/><br/>Compared with Galaxy Note 3, it only lacks the multi-tasking capability, which I don't like doing it on a small screen anyway.<br/>(Yes 5.5 inch is big, but opening two windows on that size? well... I rather turn on my laptop to do so.)<br/>Galaxy Note 3 is somewhat better on the screen sharpness and works a little faster, but it's twice more expensive than this one.<br/>I am satisfied with HTC more than Galaxy Note 3 as I can literally buy two of these and still save some extra money for the same price.<br/><br/>I have weak signal at my home, but it's the poor Sprint network, nothing to do with this phone.<br/>You might want to check the sprint network coverage on your area before you purchase it.<br/>The machine itself is very very good.
I have had two of these devices in less than 30 days. The first one had reception problems and the second one encountered a seemingly common error. (Smith - Disabled) I lost 4G connectivity when the error appeared. Nothing seems to clear the error permanently. I restarted the device, cleared the data in the app, checked for updates, and updated the profile and PRL with no success. I must say my overall experience with the phone itself was pleasant.The screen and performance was great, however the battery life left a bit to be desired. This was overcome by installing and configuring Green Power Battery Saver Pro and AutomateIT Pro. Standby battery life was increased from ~ 1 day to ~ 5 days with normal/regular usage after the applications were installed. I hope no one else has these issues as this is a solidly built device with one external exception. The backing is really slick, so I suggest holding onto the rubberish sides. I would suggest using a case or adding a skin, however I never use a case other than for storage and I have ordered a skin but it has not arrived.
This is a great phone , almost a "phablet" with a super sharp screen and great camera. We have used virginmobileusa for several years and this is a great service. A great buy.
I was very happy with this phone until the recent software update. Now my phones screen turns itself off while you are using it and I have done a factory reset on my phone. This worked for about 9 hours. Most recently my phone has turned the screen off about 10 times within a few minutes. It does bring the screen back on itself but if you try to do so- it forces the screen back off. A lot more bloatware was added to my phone as well with this update with no option to remove the apps. This included apps that when you click on them say "This is not available for your phone". I've never had good luck with HTC and I will not be purchasing another of their products.
Very pleased with this phone. However, I should have kept the 4.4 version stock OS, but I made the mistake of upgrading to 5.0.2, which is an enormous download that eats up much of the available on-phone storage. The initially epic battery life has been severely diminished, it gets HOT, and now has trouble switching between Wi-Fi and mobile data connections without having to be restarted. None of these issues is the fault of the phone or HTC, as they did not manifest prior to the "upgrade." I look forward to future patches to fix these issues with an otherwise fantastic phone.
Best android phone available for the price. This phone is as big as an iPhone 6 plus! The screen resolution is astounding, the internal memory is small but plug in an SD card and there's every bit the storage of an iPhone 6 Plus. I own this phone for less than an iPhone 6 Plus would cost with a contract. $175 for the phone and I get to pay $42/mo forever with Virgin. Win and Win.
I love it. I'm coming from a LG optimus 3 and it was awful. HTC is incredible. It's fast. The sound is beyond amazing. The screen is huge. Twice as big as my 3. Buy this phone! And I got it for 200 bucks . Amazing!!!! Shipping was slow though. But, blame FedEx.
Had this phone for a week and I can already tell it is a great phone. I had my eye on the Samsung Galaxy S5 with Virgin Mobile but did not want to pay the high price. Talked to a friend who already had the HTC 816 and she loved it. I read all the reviews I could find from users and I decided to take advantage of Amazons great price on it. What did I have to lose. The 13 mega pixel camera is great. Lots of features with it that my old Samsung SII did not have. This phone already has Android Kit Kat which is the newest operating system with a quad core processor. This phone moves seamlessly from app to app. With a speaker bar at the top and one on the bottom (both on the front of the phone) my music sounds awesome. It may be bigger in size than my Samsung but it is a lot lighter. Great screen resolution and even on the lowest brightness level, it is still easy to see everything on the screen.  With the price of this phone and the price of NO CONTRACT service with Virgin Mobile powered by Sprint ($35-$45 a month for data, talk and text) you could not go wrong with this phone. I consider it an early Christmas gift to myself.
I've been a Virgin Mobile customer for about 5 years.  I STARTED with a Samsung Intercept... Then a LG Optimus V... Then a Motorola Triumph... Then a HTC EVO 3D...  Then a Samsung Galaxy II... AND now a HTC Desire 816...  I can say...  I've been a Satisfied Virgin Mobile Customer since I quit AT&T.;  Never any droped calls, and I've saved a ton of money!  This HTC is THIN, BIG SCREEN, LIGHTWEIGHT, and FAST.  I hesitated to buy it because I was satisfied with the Galaxy II, but wanted a bigger screen.  Well, this HTC did the trick.  If you're sitting on the fence about a bigger/faster phone with VM,  Then I think you'll be satisfied with this phone...
I've been with VM for awhile and have had several phones.  This is by far the best unit they have offered, in my opinion.  The screen is large, bright, and easy to read.  The battery is more than sufficient for my useage.  I only have to charge it every other day.  The only CON I have is the slippery back.  It is easy to scratch.  Highly recommend a protective case.
I've been a Virgin Mobile customer since 2007 and upgraded from my HTC EVO 3D. I've had the HTC 816 for about two months of medium to heavy use. This is a large, mid-priced phone that looks and acts like a flagship model. I love it.<br/>The display is fantastic, the battery life is more than adequate (especially when you disable the Blinkfeed, etc) and it's REALLY easy to set up and transfer all your stuff. It may not be the fastest processor on the market, but at this price point it's pretty impressive. I augmented the storage with an inexpensive 32 GB card and moved over everything I could.<br/>Five Big Stars. I bough the phone, a tempered glass screen protector (this is not Gorilla Glass) and a snug neoprene case for under $200. Crazy!<br/>People are astonished to find out what I paid for this phone and that my plan is only $35/Month for unlimited text and data.<br/>Also: Virgin Mobile had discontinued selling this phone and soon it may not be available for purchase ANYWHERE.
This is a beast of a phone, size wise.  I never considered the dimensions of a phone before, but now it is something I need to consider.  Aside from the monstrous size (kinda feel like I have a minitablet to my face when I talk on the phone), I love this phone.  This is by far the best phone virgin mobile has.  Since I switched to virgin many many years ago, I have essentially been going with the various versions of the lg optimus phone...which had that annoy chick dancing every time you turn the phone on (I have a feeling that cheesy music with haunt me forever).  This phone is a million times better.  The thing I love the most about this phone is the rear camera.  You can take amazing photos with it.  I recently traveled to Malaysia and Laos and some of the pictures I captured where on par to my nice camera, which was a nice features especially when I didnt want to lug around my heavy camera all day.
Memory Is more important than performance! It claims to have 8gb but it only lets you actually use less than 3gb probably around 2gb. First app i wanted to get was my already purchased GTA SanAndreas app for android. About 2.3gb and the phone couldnt even install that from the lack of memory. Whats the point on having a good performance phone with a big screen if you cant even try it out from the lack of internal storage. Iv had way cheaper Virgin Mobile phones that had way more capacity and were filled with a bunch of apps without the problem im having now. So this is a major issue. I cant even download my fl studio mobile app because if i did it would be the main app and i wont be able to download much else and thats not fun. Other than that i love the big screen. Good speakers for a phone. Love the cameras.But thats all i can say
When I first received the phone in the mail I was thrilled. It worked wonderfully. I had no complaints about the durability of the phone or its functionality. Within the course of three months, the phone screen now has trouble responding to touch, and in some places won't respond to any touch. I have tried all of the suggested fixes that Virgin Mobile offered, and none of them worked. Now my Sim Card is not staying in its slot, which makes it very difficult to use many of the phone's features. The phone has never been dropped, spilled on, submerged in liquid, or been subjected to any physical damage. I have a case for it and have used screen protectors. I used it regularly and carry it in my pocket, which is common for anyone with a smart phone. I am extremely disappointed in the product and the fact that it is barely usable so shortly after purchasing. This phone is five stars on the technological side of things, but as far as durability and dependability go, it doesn't even deserve one star. I spend almost $300 on this phone and can hardly even use it anymore. Very disappointed and now very short on money because I wasted in on a cheaply made, expensive phone.
After using the phone for a few months, it became apparent that 8GB of internal storage is not enough. You get about 4GB of storage out of the box, because everything else is taken up by apps and the operating system. I purchased a 32GB micro SD card, but that essentially became storage for photos because Android won't let you move whole apps over to sd storage.<br/><br/>The phone itself takes nice photos and it has a nice screen, but since storage is so cheap nowadays ($16 for 32GB micro sd) the internal storage limit makes it obsolete very quickly. I'll be selling mine soon.
I've had this for a few months and here's what I think of it so far.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>01. The screen is big and that makes it easier to see things and type.<br/>02. It's fast and you can play games on it without lagging.<br/>03. The WiFi on it is good.<br/>04. Call quality is great.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>01. No removable battery.<br/>02. Battery life isn't great. I did, however, get around this by turning off notifications for certain programs.<br/>03. No Android 5 yet.<br/><br/>All and all, it's a great phone and I have recced it to several friends already.
If you like a big screen but have a low budget this phone is definitely worth it. I've had this phone for 4 months now and still have had no problems with it. I watch Netflix on this phone a lot with no lag plus it has great picture quality. It's very slim so it fits comfortably in your pocket. The front facing camera is amazing which at 5mp exceeds most phones out there. The dual front facing speakers are amazing and make playing games and watching movies that much more enjoyable. All in all a great phone all around with a low price tag.
I've had the phone for a few days and I like it more than my galaxy 3. I suggest getting a case because the back feels like it could get scratched up pretty easily. Battery life isn't too bad either. Edited 10-30-2014. It appears my power button is sinking inside the phone. It still works when I push it but this is very disappointing considering I've had the phone for a week. And the phone has not been dropped or mishandled in any way. We'll see what happens next. Smh
LOVE this phone.  So fast, the battery lasts forever and the camera is awesome!
This phone is great, especially for being from Virgin Mobile. I switched to this from my Samsung Galaxy S2. I couldn't be happier with my decision. The only problem I have with the phone that's stopping me from giving it 5 stars is the fact that the screen cracks extremely easily. I dropped the phone once, and initially the only damage was a chip on the corner of the phone, but over the next couple of days the screen started to have multiple cracks appearing. While it's my fault for dropping the phone, my Samsung didn't crack once, and it had been dropped multiple times. But all in all it's a great phone and I definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a bigger phone with excellent battery life and sound quality.
I have loved HTC since I got my Inspire over 4 years ago.  Excellent quality for the price.  This phone is no exception.  Quality phone at a reasonable price.  It's a new toy right now, so I haven't figured everything out, but so far, so good.  Very lightweight.  Easy to read screen.  My one complaint is the battery life.  I have to charge it every day and I don't have much running.
HTC makes beautiful, well built phones...but their Android skin and bloatware make it incredibly frustrating to use. I don't have millions of apps, but the internal storage is so jammed with stuff you can't get rid of, that I have to clear storage/uninstall apps just so I can update other apps, even if they live on my SD card.
Great phone. Great sound quality. Large screen is much better for videos & reading . Easy to use and very responsive.Despite what someone wrote it is a Virgin Mobile Phone. That is my service provider and it works just fine.He should probably seek better advice from a reliable dealer and Boost is not the same as Virgin Mobile.
Very nice it's fast has big screen and nice boom sound
I've activated and been playing with this phone for the better part of the day, so my experiences so far may be 'incomplete' compared to how I may feel given some more time with it....but here goes:<br/>This is my first new phone in 3-4 years. My last phone was a crappy LG that sucked as far as anything internet was concerned....but for text/talk it was always solid and reliable pretty much anywhere I've been in the country, and I travel pretty regularly. Very sturdy as well. In fact, the only reason I purchased a new phone is because I had dropped the LG so many times over the years that the case wouldn't stay on. I literally had to Gorilla Tape it so that the case wouldn't fall off and the battery pop out. After about a month of looking at my raggedy-ass tape-phone...I decided it was about time. The other thing that kept me with the LG for so long is that not long after, I also purchased an IPod 5 to have a dedicated mp3 player and because it had a much better camera and was also very good for internet, as long as you were hooked to WiFi. So for the last several years I've carried both devices and would use the LG for calls/texts only (and for internet if I absolutely had to and had no access to WiFi), and would use the iPod for music, internet (WiFi only) and pictures. But after the LG started to fall apart I started looking at consolidating to one device without breaking the bank. That's where the Desire 816 came in.<br/>I read a lot of reviews on Amazon and outside sources....and it seemed that for the price this was the best bang-for-your-buck. I read through all the positives and negatives so that my expectations were realisitic and pulled the trigger. First impressions:<br/>The phone is pretty big. It's one of the larger phones out there...pretty comparable in size to the IPhone 6S. It seems like most phones are getting larger now days. Finding a decent, affordable, sub-5" phone is pretty rare lately. Not sure I'm into this trend so much. And at 6" and some change...the 816 is a biggie. Honestly though, the size has its advantages as well. Home screen and in-app viewing looks really solid and crisp. You're pretty  much relegated to 2-hand texting/typing unless you have huge hands, but the 'keyboard' is large and responsive.<br/>Unfortunately...so far I have not been impressed with streaming quality. I tried to watch Netflix on it through a strong WiFi connection at home...and the quality was pretty bad. Everything looked fuzzy and it took a long time to buffer, and then continued to interrupt my show and buffer afterwards. I 've never had this problem with the iPod 5. Things load quickly and viewing quality is damn-near, if not HD quality, and I've never had buffering issues. Video tends to load SLOW on the 816 and then not be very good quality. I will put it through it's paces a bit more...but so far I'm knocking points for it. It just seems pointless to have such a huge screen if it's going to look crappy during streaming playback where it would matter the most.<br/>Apps load snd respond quickly enough for average use...although again...the iPod 5 on the same WiFi connections performs much better/faster.<br/>One thing that I find absolutely criminal with a lot of these new phones is how little internal memory comes with it ...especially compared to what the manufacturer claims. This phone is claimed to have 8gb of internal memory. After unboxing and activating...and adding NO apps of my own at that point...I was left with about half of the internal memory left. The amount of bloatware on these new phones is ridiculous. When I say criminal ...I mean it. I can't believe it's even legal to advertise this way. I would start/join a class-action suit against this kind of BS if I could. Definitely knocking points for this travesty. But again...I had done my research and had heard others complain about this, so I made sure to order a 64gb SD card with the phone. Only problem....you can't load pretty much ANY apps to the card. You can put music and pics/video on it...but not much else unless you root the phone which I may very well do, which could possibly unlock a lot of potential power and perhaps fix some of these other issues. I'm debating going that route and will update this review if I do and it makes a major difference.<br/>Out of the box set up took a while. I wasn't timing it but it seemed to take about a half hour for the phone to run through all its initial updates and to walk you through a few basic set-up steps. I am not tech-savvy at all and was having issues getting the phone activated on my own, either thru VMs website or their automated phone system. I'm sure this is totally my fault. I got a rep on the phone and another 15 or so mins later we had my phone/internet/texting/voice-mail set up.<br/>I will say that the sound quality from the front-facing speakers is by far the best internal speaker sound-quality I've ever heard in a phone. No gripes there. I only made a couple quick calls to make sure the phone was working...but in-phone call-quality seemed acceptable if nothing special.<br/>Bluetooth worked fine when pairing the 816 to a pair of Phillips wireless headphones.<br/>Battery-life seems acceptable if not more so for now. I fully charged it earlier today and after messing with it for several hours I'm just now at 17%. I'm going to try running it almost completely down from a full-charge a few times and see if I can get a better idea. I'll update when that happens.<br/>Although the phone is large...it is thin and feels pretty good in-hand. One-handed operation is doable if you're not typing much. Like if you're just scrolling through Facebook or something of the sort.<br/>After only a day...I'm definitely a bit torn. I don't love the size...especially with the laggy and poor streaming quality. I abhor the amount of useless and memory-draining apps...and the fact that I can't move to SD or delete the vast majority of them. But I do feel that for the $150 price -tag (plus $25 for the 64gb SD card which is a must if you plan to have a lot of pics/music on this phone) you get a reasonably powerful and well-rounded phone. The crappy LG I mentioned earlier cost $100 3 or 4 years ago and wouldn't do a tenth of what this phone can.<br/>As of right now...I would mainly recommend this phone to someone that wants a solid smartphone at a reasonable price and won't mind the large size. Unfortunately for me...I feel like I will still be using my IPod the majority of the time when I have Wifi availability because it performs so much better with anything internet related. So consolidating to strictly one device like I was hoping seems to be unlikely for me at this point. That said...the internet service on the 816 is passable for casual use, so I won't feel the need to carry the IPod and a phone around as much as I used to. And as I mentioned before, the option of rooting this phone may be one that I explore. If that were to unlock the full-potential of this phone and make it run a little faster and free up some memory (and could possibly even help with some of the lag/video-quality issues)...this might just be an incredible handset for the price...if I can get past the large size. As it sits it's a solid if imperfect device...but I would still say it's a good value at the $150 price-point. Much more than that and I would be a bit more picky.<br/><br/>****EDIT*****<br/>After using this phone for a month and a half now it's grown on me. I actually like the larger screen a lot more than initially did .The couple times I've used my iPod since this purchase, the screen on that device seems almost laughably small now. And speaking of...I really don't use the iPod at all anymore like I thought I would.  The HTC is definitely a bit slower but not unacceptably so.  I'm still pretty pisses about the lack of internal memory...and unfortunately all my attempts to gain root access have not worked. At this point for the price of this phone...the amount of unremovable bloatware is my biggest, and pretty much only real gripe anymore. I like this phone enough that when it recently became time to replace my wife's phone I ordered her one of these as well. She loves it.  Updating my rating from 3 to 4 stars .
This was an upgrade from an old Samsung Galaxy S2, so others upgrading from something more modern may not be as impressed. With that said, wow! First, let me commend the seller - I received this phone a full four days before the scheduled arrival. I had the misfortune of purchasing on a Thursday, and due to processing, shipping and the weekend, I wasn't supposed to receive it until the following Wednesday. It came Saturday. I was ecstatic. Huge kudos to the shipping and processing teams.<br/><br/>Upon unboxing, the first thing you notice is the size of this thing - it's big. The screen by itself is as large as my old S2, and that's not including the extra space for speakers and logo. However, even with its large size, it's surprisingly easy to handle. I have very average-sized hands and can even use the keyboard with one hand, albeit with practice. After a month of using the phone, however, I couldn't imagine owning anything smaller. It's probably heavier than many phones, but still weighs less than my wife's iPhone 5c, and is much larger.<br/><br/>The appearance is great, with a nice, big screen, matte finish and good feel. Some people may dislike the plastic back and the fingerprints that will get all over it, but that's a very minor concern - you're not using the back of your phone. A four dollar case alleviates any complaints with that entirely.<br/><br/>The interface is great. I'm very much a minimalist, and the icons for many of the default programs are nice and simple and fit the resolution perfectly. I'm still adjusting to some of the intricacies of the HTC interface as opposed to the Samsung one, but the Android base still makes everything very familiar, so it really eases the process.<br/><br/>The camera is excellent for what I've used so far. It takes large, quality images in light or dark, and you can quickly take follow-up shots without the flash (I haven't tried with the flash enabled) if you want to spam pictures to be able to get the best available. I will say that low-light images can come out grainy, but that's not abnormal, especially for a phone camera. The only thing I was forced to adjust to with the camera was the rear-camera placement. It's very easy to find your fingers blocking the camera. Again, easy to adjust to, just different.<br/><br/>The sound is less impressive than I would've expected from two front-facing speakers, but still quite good. The downside is that I can't cup the speakers to kind of control the direction, but that's such a pedantic issue that I may as well not even bring it up.<br/><br/>As for what most people are interested in - the battery life - I'm blown away. I don't understand how anyone could be disappointed with the battery life on this thing, unless they're coming from something tiny and are constantly using multiple features like GPS, WiFi and the like. Putting the phone on power saver mode, not even extreme power saver, and this phone will easily last WEEKS on standby. For example - I've been using my phone pretty heavily today for the last four hours - YouTube, Pandora, heavy browsing, constantly reconnecting to a weak hospital WiFi - and I'm still at 80%. I don't expect to need to charge my phone until I recharge myself. I don't understand how people can expect a very large phone to last for days to begin with, but to each his own. The only downside to the battery is that it does take a little longer to recharge. As I typically charge my phone while I'm asleep, this doesn't impact me whatsoever.<br/><br/>Overall, this phone is absolutely 5 star material, especially for the price. It's also probably the best option available from VM if you're not wanting to shell out $500 for a Galaxy S5.
I was in the dilemma that I'm sure many Virgin customers are in at the moment- My galaxy s3 was aging rapidly with the new android updates.  Battery life was tanking, and google maps would bring the phone to a complete standstill. Time for an upgrade. Virgin's lineup at the moment is a little bizarre. There are tons of sub-100 dollar phones, then the S3 and the Desire 816, and finally the S5 and the iPhone. Not much of a range there. I was initially worried about this choice due to the price point being ten bucks lower than the S3. I did not want similar phone for the money. Thankfully, this was not the case at all. This is now my favorite phone to date. A few reasons why:<br/><br/>1) Size/utility. This phone is huge, but somehow is easier to handle than the S3. The weight distribution is also better, which leads to an overall nice feel in the hands.<br/><br/>2) Build Quality. The front of the phone features the huge screen and a nice grey matte finish on the plastic. That same matte finish is on the rim as well. The back panel is shiny plastic that feels a bit more cheap. It also attracts fingerprints. Overall, the build quality is fine, and the design of the phone makes it feel less plastic-y and flashy than the S3.<br/><br/>3) HTC's UI is much more sleek than Samsung's overly saturated and noisy interface. HTC's just feels more mature and subtle. I also love the fact that it doesn't guilt you for listening to headphones at high volume. The interface is smarter, easier to use, and results in less navigation being needed to access core features on the phone. The status bar, in particular, will handle most of what you will need to do on this phone quickly and easily.<br/><br/>4) Camera. No contest here. The 8MP on the S3 is obviously dated, but that camera also lacked a lot of features that most other phones now possess. The Desire 816's camera is solid, and shoots stunningly good photos if the lighting is right. As with most phone cameras, though, don't expect stellar shots in low light, though this phone definitely handles those shots better than the S3.<br/><br/>5) Speed. Again, no contest. This phone is much faster than the S3. No more freezing in google maps!<br/><br/>6) Music/sound. Though not advertised, this is definitely a phone for the music lover. This phone has a micro SD slot on the side, not behind the battery or in the rear housing. The access is easy and quick. I bought an SD card and loaded it with tons of files from my PC. Surprisingly, the on board HTC music app can handle any format I throw at it. It also looks nice and functions well. Certainly a surprise feature. The speakers are also great. I've never heard sound like this from a phone. I used to use a small bluetooth speaker around the house, but this phone's sound has eliminated the need.<br/><br/>A note on battery: I've seen other users disappointed by battery life. Mine is much better than my S3. Also, disabling HTC's media feed app will help a lot.<br/><br/>If you are in my position and looking for something faster/better than the S3 without upgrading the S5 or an iPhone, this is absolutely the phone to get.
I have to preface this review by saying I was one of the last holdouts of a flip phone. Not just out of necessity, and cheapness, but also because I was proud of that flip phone. I work in the tech field, so it was fun to bring on the comments and discussion when I whipped that baby out and flipped it open. Especially as the screen had cracked a long time ago, and the glass was held in by tape. So did I really even want a smartphone? I am online all the time anyway, and it seemed like it was a huge time sucker, did I really need to be online more? Did i want to be like everyone else, sitting at dinner staring into my phone?  Also I had a pay as you go on the flip phone and I hardly used it. The downside is everyone texts me, and I was paying for sending and receiving. It was only when I was walking down the street with my son and got a call, and to see his embarrassment, then when he wouldn't even take it when he was going somewhere, did the cracks in my flip phone pride begin to show. Also, having experienced the wonders of using Google maps in different cities, I was sold on the idea. It was just a matter of satisfying my frugal nature.<br/>So in short I had time to do a lot of research and decided based on many reviews of a variety of phones, that if I got one it would be the HTC 816. Read the reviews, most have legitimate points.<br/>-The battery to me seems ok. If I am home with stable wifi, it lasts for 2 days. While at work, presumably where it is searching it lasts for a whole day. I found turning off some things like Skype helped. There are battery saving options.<br/>-The sound is really good! Impressive actually for the size of the device.<br/>-I get the LTE signal most of the time. I've only had a couple web sites hang when using the 3g option. Streaming Netflix, or Youtube has been seemless for the most part. Good clean picture.<br/>-I also bought a 64gb micro sd card which should be way more than enough. I uploaded thousands of pics to it and barely put a dent. The apps do take up much of the 8gb of memory in the phone, so you'll want most everything to go to the sd card.<br/>-There is a nice tutorial website for newbies like me.<br/>-The one thing I had to get used to was the power button. As mentioned in other reviews, it is kind of inconvenient, but not a deal breaker for me by any stretch of the imagination. It just took some getting used to.<br/>-It is large, which also takes some getting used to, but the benefits to that outweigh the detriment, for me at least. I was comparing my phone with a friend who had the latest phone, rhymes with snapple,  which costs more than twice what mine does, and they were the same size and thickness. He also had complaints about his battery, and it seemed mine lasted longer. That was all we compared, so I'm sure in other ways his is ahead, but again, this phone was $300 to $400 cheaper. It's bigger than most phones, and smaller than a tablet, is it a phablet? a phoblet? A phonlet?<br/>So to sum up, as an admitted first time smart phone buyer, so far I am happy...knock on wood. If you have time, read as many reviews as possible of this and other products to compare. I found this phone had as high if not higher stars than the top, much more expensive phones. It may not have the HD quality of the more expensive phones but it is still pretty good. I kind of miss my old flip phone, in other words not paying a monthly bill, but oh well. My old flip phone couldn't guide me through unfamiliar cities either. And I find I use text much more than talking.<br/>I have noticed that the phone is no longer for sale on the Virgin site.
It was a huge change going from Samsung Galaxy phones to HTC. but i love it so far. Also, i did not pay attention to the size factor when purchasing it, just the basic specs when comparing it to other phones on VM. The thing is huge. I also adore the fact that the average cost of any phone case for it is less than $10 here on amazon. i like to switch it up sometimes.I wont pretend to know dick about specific phone specs, but it stays charged well throughout my day with regular use, the phone is easy to use and program, the sound is amazing, the screen is aesthetically pleasing and the camera is pretty decent. It was a great bang for my buck deal compared to the price of other phones.<br/><br/>Huge, and i mean HUGE CON<br/>The virgin mobile app will hijack your phone and completely reset you settings randomly, and there is nothing you can do about it. Its nothing to do with the phone, just the forced company app. The best way i have found to avoid the situation is to let it, then don't undo the updates. you can just uninstall the unwanted apps, reset your background and home screen settings and everything else with it still installed. that way if your turn off your phone or it dies and shuts down, it doesn't just decide to reset everything back to its preferred factory settings. You can not get rid of it or do anything about it. but if you let it just once do its thing, then reset all your personal setting preferences and delete the new app icons, then it will leave you be. You have to be sure to not uninstall its updates, because it will force update no matter what and redo everything. it just needs that one time to update and its cool. it turns in to a situation of you leave it alone, it will leave you alone.
Ordered this phone on a Friday and received it on Sunday!!!!! Next day shipping is worth the 10 bucks it cost. The Desire 816 on first impressions is the BEST mid-range android with a large screen that you can buy. As for performance I will edit this review accordingly.<br/><br/>Pros:  Price<br/>  Camera<br/>  Screen Real Estate<br/><br/>Cons:  24 hour wait for number portings<br/>  Lack of "Premium" accessories<br/>  Only 8 gigs of internal memory
Yes,Im legally blind ( 20/400 both eyeballs)& tears ran down my face as I held in my hand the phone I purchased for my daughter on her 14th birthday. I've been suffering from an illness that took away my sight. My whole entire brain & world sat on my Samsung Galaxy. It was the phone that I activated using VM after becoming quite disquested with some of the pay- each -month services if needed  in my area. I was in such awe of my Samsungs screen, it seemed to hv made my life abit easier with simple things like cell phone clarity like none I've seen before which  made scheduling easier. Also being able to see my daughters' faces up close & in person w/ their photos...well up until my youngests daughters birthday I really thought I had a very nice screen for my budget. The moment she turned the phone on true clarity & true beauty sat in front of our faces. I knew at that moment I was going to be buying myself this phone. Sadly enough I had been a Samsung loyal customer until my 2nd phone I had been using had the charging port broken very close to my year warranty was up exactly like the 1st phone did. I don't hv the time or money to be buying phones on a yearly basis. I hope the HTC doesn't let me or my daughter down come 1 yr from now. Only other downfall would be the storage or lack of on this amazing device. C'mon teens love photo shopping &chopping; & they usually hv a bunch of pics.Currently my girl has less then 50 pics of herself on her phone & maybe 10or so apps installed and she's already requesting a larger micro sd card. Pretty much all around very happy new customer!!
Out of every phone from Virgin Mobile (including the iPhone 5) this is by far the best phone so far. I really love it. Its big but not too big. even though its only a 720p phone the colors are so vibrant and bright. There isn't anything I really can complain about it.
Great flag ship phone for people that don't use it everysecond of the day( I did use for a couple hours of music and YouTube) ,unplugged (100%) it at 6:30am &was; at 43% by 7pm  without power save mode , the battery doesn't get drained just searching for signal like it did for HTC Evo 3d (previous phone ), I've had it for little over a month and still use the awesome speakers at home a lot ,the surround sound feel,is better than my clock radio .
Have had this phone for only 2 weeks or so, but really like it. When I first unboxed, thought maybe I made a mistake buying such a big phone but am used to the size now and love it. My phone it's replacing (HTC EVO 3D with 4.3" screen), and my wive's iPhone, seem so small now. Still small enough to fit in front pants pocket (men's anyway). One thing I was worried about was the battery life. My old HTC phone couldn't make it through the day without recharging it at work, and that was with minimal use. Made me really think about making this purchase.The battery on this phone so far has been very impressive. I'm not one of those people who has their phone in their hand all the time, making less than a dozen calls and texts combined a day, but I do use it for web browsing more than anything and the battery lasts about a day and a half/two days. Very pleased wih this phone. Also, as far as I'm concerned (for me anyway), you can't beat the $35 Virgin Mobile pay as you go plan. 300 minutes talk per month (now with rollover minutes), unlimited text and data. Have no complaints with coverage.<br/><br/>Also, if you're interested in purchasing this phone, found a great case for it.Very solid, two layer protection. Feels more solid than my Otter Box I had on my last phone, which had the screen shatter when it fell from my coat pocket.<br/>http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SNRB4FM/ref=cfb_at_prodpg.
I absolutely love this phone. It has its pros and cons, but I would recommend it. It's huge. The 5.5 inch screen and great resolution makes it look.pretty incredible. The HTC BoomSound works great. It doesn't get as loud as I thought it would, but the quality of the sound is superb. It's Quad core processor works great. I can go from one thing to another liked tht.<br/><br/>Pros: 5.5" screen<br/>Great resolution<br/>Great working quad core processor<br/>13mp rear camera, 5mp front<br/>2 front speakers<br/>LTE is super fast ( with high speed)<br/>updates to android lollipop<br/><br/>Cons: battery life isn't the greatest (if ur playing games using the camera or watching videos the battery doesn't last u very long if ur texting all day or calling or checking ur social media like Facebook Twitter or ur emails it usually lasts all day)<br/><br/>Sometimes I have to restart the phone because my keyboard stops working which, to me, isn't tht big of a deal<br/><br/>Not a lot of space if ur a serious gamer u can extend ur storage with an SD card though<br/><br/>Over a I think this phone is great and if u have big hands, desire a bigger screen, or want a phone tht still upgrades to the latest android version on the cheapest prepaid network(Virgin Mobile) then I believe this phone might be right for u
On May 5th HTC released Lollipop for the Desire 816, the Virgin Mobile version anyway.  The update took about 25 minutes without a glitch. There were times when the screen was blank and nothing seemed to be happening. If you do the update just let the phone sit and maybe check occasionally for any message (none with mine). Ignore signs of inactivity within the first half hour at least. Note the Lollipop download takes some time so a slow network connection may make the update time longer. Make sure the phone is well charged. So far Lollipop works perfectly on the 816. No settings or contacts were affected by the update. All the preexisting apps I have tried work as usual though some look a bit different.<br/><br/>There are plenty of reviews here so I won't be redundant. I luv the Desire 816 and Virgin's Sprint network works well in northeastern NJ. I've had the 816 since August 2014. The phone has been very reliable without a single lockup. I usually turn the 816 off for a couple of minutes once every 2 weeks, something one should do with any phone to clear out temporary files and refresh the os. If you don't need a very powerful processor or ultra hd display this phone is hard to beat at this price point if the Virgin network is reliable in your area. And of course you want a big phone.
I got this phone last week and so far it's been great....I was at a Hall for a surprise party in the Bronx, everyone had poor reception including some iPhones and other brands and carriers, on the other hand I had exceptional reception, some people even ask me what kind of phone is that...lol The camera takes a little time to get use to, especially the settings. Great camera though, it takes good quality pictures.  The Network/wi-fi speed is great also.  Overall big bang for the buck, you can't go wrong with the price.
After my screen cracked on my Galaxy S3, I replaced it with this one. The S3 is a good phone but I find that all the little bugs that the Samsung one had, are gone here. Apps don't crash as frequent. Maybe it's because I learned not to have so many open at a time. My WiFi connections are stable, bugs in most apps are gone. Camera is great quality and the screen is nice and big. I thought that a phone this size would have trouble fitting into my front pocket, but no, not an issue at all. speakers are nice sounding.<br/><br/>The only things I can think that irked me are the gallery app. The phone will automatically place random photos into a highlight reel that plays all throughout the gallery. Even when you erase the highlights, the phone will pop new ones back in. Kind of annoying but I disabled the ZOE app and it hasn't came back. Also, since the phone doesn't have physical home and back buttons, the location of these buttons change as the screen rotates. Providing you have auto rotate feature on. Oh, the default music player doesn't have an equalizer which is a bummer, but the dual speakers sound great.<br/>So yea, I'm happy with the phone.
There is a pre installed app called core zone. It is spyware! It installs itself over and over,especially when I am accessing financial data. I have written to HTC and received no help,even though they said if I would send them the serial numbers they would help. Wrong! I will never buy HTC again.
First-This is brand new, in the Virgin Mobile Box phone, for ridiculously less. I don't know how Amazon does it, but I appreciate it!<br/>Second-This has a 5 megapixel FRONT CAMERA! The best in the business along with the m8.<br/>Third-This has the fastest processor for a mid- priced phone (1.6 GHz).Along with 1.5 g of ram, all apps and games run smooth.<br/>Fourth- Yes , the boomsound speakers are the best in the business, way better than any phone out there ( except for other htc phones)<br/>Cons:<br/>-embedded battery<br/>-no mhl out (no video output whatsoever-I checked)You have to get a mirror link device if you want to watch on tv.<br/>-8 gig rom , 4 gig user accessable.You need to root this phone if you want to download more than a few apps and games.<br/>(go to xda developer website-they make it easy with a super root program-make sure your phone is working properly first,though, because rooting voids the warranty)<br/>If you get this phone, I highly recommend the Nillkin flip case. It actually has a dual plastic back shell surrounding the leather on the back side .
This phone is a absolutely awesome. The display is large, vivid, and crystal clear. The battery life so far from what I can tell is awesome. I took it to work today and had it in my purse asleep, used for 45 minutes during lunch and break no more than 5 percent used. The sound, I see now why HTC gets so much praise for their BoomSound. Believe me, it blows the rest out of the water. We actually use it as a stereo on the way home and can hear every song clearly, we are thinking about getting a speaker mounted in the car for more bass (no CD player in the car or USB hook-up).<br/>Phone calls- none dropped so far and very clear and loud. I used it in my chair where it only shows one bar because Sprint coverage is very spotty here and I had no problem hearing them and they had no problem hearing me. Where we work, we get 4G LTE and its perfect. Download speeds were around 20KMBps with 2 bars on 4G and 3G with full bars is around 10MBps.<br/>Virgin Mobile, not sure why it gets so much flack but I enjoy their service. The price is good and the service so far has been good. I think you can't beat 2.5GB with unlimited texting and 300 minutes for 35 bucks. I personally don't use 300 minutes a month, most don't even know why I pack a phone but I love smartphones.<br/>I forgot to mention about the camera, so far from what I have seen it takes good pictures. We have only taken pictures in the house of the kittens and they are clear but I do not understand smart phone camera zoom's. I don't zoom in much but it will get kind of fuzzy. I might have it set up wrong though in the settings. I am not a camera person, just a tech person (computers, cellphones, satellites).<br/>The scrolling is perfect and smooth, no stutters at all. I have not changed anything in the developer options whatsoever.<br/>This phone all in all is perfect and at 200 dollars, that makes it a perfect 10 in my book. I have owned a Galaxy S3, LG G2, and Iphone 4 and this one is ten thousand times better than the rest to me. The S3 stuttered like mad, G2 was crazy expensive on the monthly bill (Verizon) and the Iphone 4 had the tiniest screen known to man.<br/>All in all, perfect phone. Buy it, you will be happy!
Good phone, good performance with an OK camera but one massive problem - This device suffers from severe internal storage issues which can make it an absolute chore to install a reasonable amount of apps (or large apps in general). After updating to the newest Lollipop Android OS, the already small 8GB internal storage gets cut in half with over 4GB dedicated to "Other," and a whopping 2GB left for apps and internal storage.<br/><br/>Moving apps to the SD card is a must, but since certain apps simply can't be moved and the HTC bloatware takes up a considerably large chunk of storage (even when uninstalling updates or rolling them back) there aren't many options to deal with the situation. It's incredibly disappointing, as the phone has great performance and good battery life but when you have barely a single panel of apps installed and you're already getting "Insufficient storage" messages, something is clearly wrong and until HTC fixes it you're better off going with offerings from Samsung, LG, Google, etc. for Android needs.
I really like my new HTC Desire!! I really love the fact that I didn't have to give up an arm and a leg for it...it was decently priced.  Battery life is pretty decent, as well...if you don't have a bunch of apps running in the background, which will cause it to drain faster. If you use the navigation app, it will really drain the battery, even when it is plugged into the power charger.  I just recently went on a road trip and found out that if I have the navigation running and other apps running in the background, it will cause "over-consumption" of the battery and the phone will stop charging.  So, be careful of that.  Another issue I have with it is not enough memory capacity for all the apps I want to download, since it has only 4.2 GB of storage. So, if you are not into downloading a lot of apps, then this will be the perfect Android phone for you! As far as it's picture taking capabilities...it can take some pretty decent pictures...you just have to know how to tweak the settings to get the right effects.
So grateful to have found this phone. Especially here on Amazon. I had a limited budget and found it first on the virgin mobile website for $279 and to my surprise I found it here on Amazon for $199! As you can imagine I was very skeptical of the discount but thankfully there were no loopholes or hidden fees. The phone itself has several great features. First of all I have received many compliments on the size and its very convenient for Netflix or tv lovers. Secondly the speakers are amazing and so vivid. The camera is decent , it has good quality but not comparable to phones such as the IPhone. Download speeds are super fast. So if you are like I was, in search of an affordable IPhone deal or of equal value you are most likely not going to find one as good as this. The reviews were really helpful and I'm glad I took them into consideration. I am really satisfied with my choice and it's been about a month since I purchased.
This phone is great I have to say. I purchased it about 3 weeks ago and was waiting to see how it performed before I gave a review. I can't really complain about it, there are however a few things I have time point out. In the other reviews , other people commented on the battery. I do admit the battery could hold it's charge a bit better but hey that's what chargers are for. I would say I have a decent amount of applications and just recently I got alerts to update them but the phone is saying there is limited storage, however there I'd a micro chip slot in the phone so I would just be able to purchase that in the next couple out weeks. Other then those two minor issues this phone is awesome considering the price e .I had an iPhone before this and people were telling me your going to want your iPhone back. I was hesitant, but to my surprise I have yet to feel that way. I would definitely recommend it.
This phone is way too big. It has a great display, but it feels like a toy. I dropped it and it shattered (I should have had a case on it, but it wouldn't charge with the case I had on). The sound is pretty good, and the battery lasts a long time. But one thing I hate is that there is no privacy when you're using this phone. Everyone around you could look and see what you're doing. Some phones have the fade when you look at it from another angle, but not this one. I wouldn't but this phone again. I've had it for about 6 months, and I just can't handle how crappy it is. It took forever to get the newest android update, and now my phone is incredibly slow. I've just ordered the Galaxy s5, which is more expensive, but worth the cost. This phone was a waste of money, it's no surprise that Virgin Mobile doesn't directly sell it from their site anymore.
Update of a previous review.  I have seen this phone priced as high as $250, which is not bad for an unsubsidized, mid-range smartphone.  I bought my first one on Amazon at $179, now they are down to $149.  I suspect this is a clearance, as this phone is no longer listed on the Virgin Mobile website.<br/><br/>We have will soon have 3 family members all running the same phone.  Yes; it's that good.<br/><br/>Virgin Mobile has some of the best plans but some of the worst phones.  It's slim pickins on the VM website.  I think Sprint uses the VM brand to get people in the door, and then pushes them to Sprint when they want a decent phone.  This phone is a nifty way to circumvent that strategy; it's one of the best that VM has ever offered.  Online activation of a VM branded phone is equally easy no matter where you buy it.  Amazon has better prices and selection than the VM website, so this is the right place to be shopping.<br/><br/>This phone is almost as good as a Nexus 6, for about 1/3 of the price.  The case is plastic instead of metal, so the phone will not tolerate unlimited punishment.  I bought a case and glass screen protector, so it should be ok.  The speakers are superior, camera is very good. The screen is quite large.  Resolution is not quite up to iPhone retina standard but it's more than adequate, especially considering the large size.  You can get a slightly better phone, but not in this price range.  This phone uses the Google app store, which is a big plus.<br/><br/>This phone arrives running Android 4.4 (Kit Kat), but upgrades to 5.0 (Lollipop).  Kudos to HTC for not forcing this phone into obsolescence.<br/><br/>There are better phones out there, but not in this price range.  Using this phone with Virgin Mobile means you can say "No" to contracts and $600 phones without giving up very much.  Highly recommended.
I love the HTC desire816!!!! the size of the screen,settings,set up are great! I'm still learning all the features,but the features I do know& use,I love(I love HTC anywayslove,I think they have the best phones out there right now) I have to say at the beginning,I had ordered a different phone but then decided on this one&I'm so glad I did. but as far as  cancelling the original order&changinging my order to this phone Amazon was awesome! they we're always right there anytime I called or emailed them,they we're very helpful&made the whole situation a lot easier than I thought. it was the 1st time ever using Amazon&I've used it several times since then.so far I think Amazon is great&will continue using it.now I hope this helps anyone wondering or thinking about using Amazon.......I highly recommend it '''
I love these phone so much I bought another for my gf n she is a former iPhone 5s user n she says she love this phone more then Apple
I bought this phone Thursday and was in my city in 2 days. Fast shipping. And the phone is just perfect. I love it. So fast. The screen is huge. Its so much better than an iPhone. The camera is amazing. Speakers are crazy! Just buy the phone you won't be dissapointed! Best phone I've ever bought. Its so fast also.
I absolutely love this phone. The size is great, screen is attractive, battery life is outstanding, extremely thin, processor is fast, speakers have no equal (most people don't realize the music source is my phone, they think it is a radio or tv, then refuse to believe it when I tell them it is my phone), and the operating system installed by HTC is great and attractive. My friends with galaxy s5's are jealous.<br/><br/>This phone is an incredible deal when on sale, and it still worth it at the normal price of $300.<br/><br/>Cons: Pixels in the screen refresh to a new color slowly, leaving trails when scrolling or dragging icons. Occasional glitches require a restart, but this may be because I am running a launcher that is still under development.
This phone is amazing. I haven't set it up yet since I've only had it for about an hour. But I love it. It's replacing my sprint galaxy s3.<br/>I never disliked my galaxy but I've gotten use to my galaxy tab s 8.4 - so the bigger screen size on this phone isn't too much of an adjustment.<br/>This feels like a great phone it actually fits in my hand better. Although I don't have a case on it yet and my galaxy had an otterbox. Which is going to be really nice for resale value since it protected it perfectly over the past two years - but it jumped out of my hands about 50 times so the otterbox was more cumbersome it seemed. And at this price point, with a standard gel case - if I do break the phone it won't break the bank to replace.<br/><br/>The best part about this phone though - bought it on Sunday afternoon and here, Tuesday afternoon it is with free shipping. Guess there's an amazon warehouse on the other side of my state now.<br/><br/>*UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE* - VIRGIN MOBILE SERVICE IS AMAZING.<br/><br/>My work is notorious for having zero cell service inside. AT&T; was the only carrier that anyone ever received service inside where they could make regular calls. That is until I purchased this phone and set it up through virgin mobile. I had sprint before and I could not make a call 99% of the time until I was down the street from my work. Well I just made a call from inside to another skeptics phone(which went to their voicemail) and they were in shock when I put the call on speaker. They tried to tell me my service was lousy and that I left a perfectly good carrier(sprint)<br/><br/>Well I just made a call and sent a text just fine from inside our aluminum cell block. It is official. whether it's virgin mobile or the HTC 816 or the two together. This carrier and phone just hit my all time best buy list. Thanks amazon, virgin mobile, htc... I feel like I just one the little league world series.<br/><br/>*UPDATE*<br/><br/>So after using this phone for a few weeks it's still amazing. Such a great deal. It is in fact, the perfect size for a phone ever.It never flies out of my hand like my GS3 did(although I had a clunker otterbox on it which is just awkward to hold) And let me tell you this, the SLOW MO video makes it sooooooo much better. You need a decent amount of light(this goes for almost any device doing this task) but it's slow mo looks incredible. I tried explaining it's awesomeness to my brother(who claimed his phone has that) and had to interupt him and say- "No. This is not the samsung galaxy class video slowed down. This is AWESOME looking slow mo." AND IT RECORDS 60FPS regular for sports or anything you need a higher frame rate for.<br/><br/>I'm happy all the reviewers agree that this phone is just a fantastic buy.
I switched from a AT&T; Note 3 to the HTC Desire  816 and so far I am really happy with this phone.  The size is similar (smidge bigger) than the note 3. I have always been a fan of HTC phones. It is quick and smooth haven't had any problems with the phone lagging. The camera quality is great in my opinion. Having a good camera is really important to me and I haven't had any bad quality photos. The only thing I did was download a keyboard from the play store because I felt like I wasn't able to type very fast and accurate on the phone. The new keyboard solved that problem. The call quality is some thing I am still getting used to. Overall I am very impressed with this phone and you can beat it at only $55 a month on Virgin Mobile.
I upgraded to this phone from a Samsung Intercept and it's perfect for my needs.<br/><br/>I can play games, check email, watch YouTube and Netflix, and it's essentially replaced my computer as my go-to device. The speakers are great (and LOUD) for all of my media needs.<br/><br/>It's probably not quite as powerful as the top-tier phones out there, but it's just as speedy and beefy as most of my friends' phones and at a fraction of the price. I've had people ask me about this phone and refer to it as "a more expensive phone" and when I tell them how cheap it is, it really blows them away.<br/><br/>One of my only complaints would be that it's easy to turn on in your pocket, but it's not a big deal.
For the price of the phone it's a pretty good deal. Only real issue is my screen smashed the 3rd day i had the phone. It's way bigger than you'll probably expect and fell out of my jacket pocket. Now barely 3 months latter I'm having problems with my microphone during calls. I can hear everyone, they can't hear me unless the phone is in safe mode and on speaker. I'm disappointed with the customer care number I can't seem to find a way to speak with an actual person about possible replacing or repairing my phone. I never had a problem with htc phones in the past this one is just very easily damaged and I'm pretty upset that I most likely need to buy a replacement after only having the phone since February.
Terrible terrible terrible! The phone came with the internal storage FULL. It had 8 GB but it came preloaded with a bunch of useless apps that COULD NOT BE UNINSTALLED. I couldn't uninstall any of the apps, so  I couldn't download any new apps. I bought a 16 GB SD card and still couldn't download any apps! The way it works is that you have to download apps to the phone and then transfer the apps to your SD card. But, the phone came FULL, so I couldn't download anything to the phone, and thus couldn't transfer any apps to my SD card. I even called tech support. Spent an hour on the phone with them, and they couldn't even help me. Really sucks. Such a nice phone but utterly useless.
Great phone. Amazing camera and features. Battery life goes down really quick. Not what was stated as far as ability of battery...  Also I paid $185 june 3rd. Stating only one phone left if remember that part correctly.  Now has phone for $149. Not happy about that at all...  Is there a way to get new battery in place of difference on price of phone? Plus, I forgot to ask for insurance.  Is it offered?  Just bought my husband his phone and put insurance on his and forgot mine. Willing to give 5 star for battery fix and insurance in place of refund for difference or return the phone.  It is a super awesome phone other than battery issue for me.
For the price, this is one of the most reliable phones out there (as of January 2015).<br/>I upgraded to this from the LG Optimus F3 (Virgin Mobile).<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Camera and resolution is excellent (13 MP back, 5 MP front).<br/>-Battery life is outstanding. From 7am to around 11pm, and much use during the day, it's still around 50-60%!<br/>-5.5 inch screen is something I had to get used to, but totally worth it.<br/>-Quad-core processor + Android 4.4.2 is VERY fast!<br/>-Almost everything can be stored on an SD card, except apps (correct me if I'm wrong), and is expandable to 64gb.<br/>-Two stereo speakers on the front make this thing like a little boombox! Loud and clear.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Internal storage is only 8gb (fine with me, but 16gb is becoming a standard and might be necessary for you).<br/>-Sometimes feels slippery, would recommend buying a rubbery case/screen protector<br/><br/>Definitely recommend!
Have had phone for several days and it is awesome !!! Easy to operate  ,very fast , great color , huge screen and the best sound I have heard on the market , would recommend for any one young , old , budget or not ! Can't be beat for price and quality ! Do not turn on phone until you are ready to activate or it will be a little bit harder process than it has to be ! If calling to activate use a phone with good call quality so you can hear clearly , don't sync unless necessary it will kill your high speed data ! Check for virgin mobile coverage before purchase !
I bought this phone as an upgrade from the HTC one V thru virgin mobile. It's a big phone-they call it a phablet, but the resolution and sound quality are great.<br/><br/>Some downsides are that the case selection for this phone are minimal, some apps can't be moved to external storage (though they could on the previous phones), and it can take a while to fully charge...<br/><br/>The pros: good battery life if put in power saver mode, the sound is great. Mostly responsive to your touch, has Swype keyboard, and have had no issues with lagging.
Phone is great....battery lasts me about a day and a few hours...phones is just great
Upgraded from ZTE awe.<br/><br/>Received this on December 26th. The screen is big and awesome.  Camera works well, although there is no image stabilization so some blur when there is movement. Enough storage for me, plus, I added a 32gb sd card. The speakers are very good, however, not as incredible as some reviews make them seem. Blazing fast when on Wi-Fi, haven't had to much experience on 3g or 4g yet.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a great phone at the right price. Will update after a few months.
Wayy bigger than expected, in the best way possible! Has about 8 GB of phone storage, with capabilities of an SD card of up to 32 GB and you CAN move apps to SD card if the app allows it. Built in "Swype" and emoji keyboard, amazing camera! Kids mode account option, updates to Android Lollipop, you can download more fonts on Google play, built in flashlight , and amazing speakers. All in all this is a huge bargain for the quality! 💗 Hope this helps!
On my second phone because the first phones speakers rattled, made the return, went phoneless for a week, only to receive the new phone...that still rattles. Not sure if this is the phone itself or delivery drivers handling but both phones speakers rattle which is highly annoying. I would return it seeing as I spend a good amount of money but I'm not gonna go phoneless another week only to get another phone that rattles. Lesson learned.
Great value! This is a huge phone,thin and has great battery life. I upgraded from my HTC EVO 3D because of its horrible battery life and I'm really satisfied with this one. Camera is better than my last phone although not quit as good as other phones like the galaxy. I do like all the editing features on the camera though. The 4 stars is for the camera .I would defenetly recommend this one.
This is the kind of phone that forces you to always carry a charger or power bank everywhere you go. I use the phone mostly for texting and Facebook, and have to charge it twice a day. The phone has an internal battery which can not be removed, so you can not purchase a better battery for it. Other than the battery issue, this phone is a good Virgin Mobile phone.
I had no trouble activating this phone and it was cheaper than buying it from Virgin Mobile. The HTC backup app let me easily transfer all the info/ and data from my old Samsung phone to this one.  I've had the Virgin Unlimited Voice, Data, and Text plan for about 18 months and I'm very happy with that.  This phone is awesome.  So large that I can surf the web on it and yet it still fits easily in my front jeans pocket.  I wish I'd not "suffered" so long with my previous smaller phone so long.
This is an awesome phone and I don't have much to add that the other reviews have not addressed.  But I do want to forewarn anyone that is on the virgin mobile $25 month (300 talk minutes, unlimited text and data) you cannot use that plan on this phone, you will need to upgrade to the 35$ month plan.  Other than that very pleased with the product.
I've had it now for a couple weeks.  Bought two, one for me and one for the Mrs.  Great display, fun to play with.  The big display eats into the battery life. So so camera.  All in all we are very happy with the phone and very happy -I think- with virgin mobile.  Works better with a stylus.  A great deal on a very good smartphone.  --2 weeks later I've upped by stars to 5  I recommend this phone.  Great display, everything works.  Good not great camera and battery life.  GREAT PHONE for the price
The cell phone is awesome!!! I come from using an iPhone and I love the fact that I can personalize my phone to my needs and views that I want. Camera is not bad but I did not know that it records in slow-motion; this feature is truly amazing. Love the HTC Blink and its features. The battery life could be a little better but if I want to use my phone a lot I make sure that I have a place to charge it. Worth the purchase.
This is a big phone bit not too big to handle. So far I really like it. The LTE download is 56mbs verses my home cable wifi at 13.5mbs. The screen is crisp and the front BOOM speakers are the best of any phone Ive ever had. The shinny plastic back makes the phone slippery tho, easy fix with some 440 sandpaper
I bought it an year ago and my first reaction was - OMG, this phone is huge, I will return it! You get used to the size very quick. It's just as good as Samsung Galaxy s5, only that the price I spent for this HTC was just $130 !!! No problems so far, works very fast, I absolutely recommend it.
Before heading off to school I decided it was time to upgrade phones to the HTC Desire 816. This phone is one of Virgin Mobile's nicer phones, and is only available on Amazon. Some specifics I'd like to touch on in this review include the design, battery life, performance, and call quality.<br/>Design<br/>The phone has a clean and sleek black design, with a glass front screen and matte phone cover on the reverse side. Though the matte cover on the back of the phone may show fingerprints after some use, it can easily be covered by any phone case. The front of the phone has no home, back and options buttons because they are digitalized, and only display when you tap the bottom of the screen. By having these buttons digitalized, the front of the phone looks less cluttered and more modern.<br/>Battery Life<br/>The battery life of the Desire 816 lasts all day with moderate use of apps, calls or texts. I've noticed that the battery on the phone declines a bit faster when using numerous apps in a short amount of time, or when on battery sucking apps such as YouTube or Tumblr. There is a power-saver feature on the phone you may turn on if you plan on using apps heavily. If you charge this phone to 100% while sleeping, the battery should easily last until you plug it in the next night.<br/>Performance<br/>The performance of the phone is spectacular; I haven't had any issues or complaints yet. The Desire 816 is very fast and never slows or overheats when using a lot of apps. If you plan on backing out, opening, or switching apps, even while an app like music is running in the background, you will always get a quick response from the phone. The cover on the back of the phone isn't removable, so I've worried that if the phone would lock up I would not have a way to reset it. However, this did happen once and the phone was smart enough to notice it wasn't responding to my rapid pokes, restarted itself, and was back to normal in under a minute.<br/>Call Quality<br/>While this phone may look nice, run apps quickly and last all day, what should really matter is the quality of its sole purpose; calling. Let me say, there are no issues in this department either, because calls have always been easy to make, hear, and end no matter the conversation. You can easily make calls by opening the phone app and dialing a number. Adjusting call volume and options is easy and may be done while in a call, just take the phone away from your ear and it will display the settings.<br/>The HTC Desire 816 is a really nice phone and well-priced for all that it offers. You can expect a sleek, responsive phone with a battery that will last you all day. Without a doubt, this is the nicest phone out there offered by Virgin Mobile.
I'm going to start by saying that this is a wonderful deal for a high mid-range smartphone.<br/><br/>The front of the phone features a beautiful 5.5 inch screen which definitely does not reflect the mediocre resolution and PPI. The colors and brightness have always been great for me. It also has two Boomsound speakers on the top and bottom which produce the best sound quality I've ever heard on a phone. It also has a 5 megapixel front facing camera which is very impressive and is great for video calls and selfies. The top of the phone has a 3.5mm headset jack to the right and a small hole to the left of it which sports the secondary microphone for noise cancellation. The left side of the phone has two buttons--the volume rocker and power--which I have not had any issues with though they're a little too high for my liking. The right side of the phone has a slot that pops out for inserting the SIM and SD card. It has two slots although one is locked and it supports up to 128 GB. The bottom side of the phone simply has a USB port. The back side of the phone is non removable with a 2,600 mAh battery which does not withstand benchmark tests. I get 8 hours out of it with moderate use, and 6 with constant heavy usage. It also has a 13 megapixel camera with LED flash which takes amazing pictures as long as it has enough light.<br/><br/>When you turn the phone on, you see the stock lockscreen which I recommend replacing because it is not customizable and is not very safe considering you can just pull down the notification drop-down and change all your settings. You also see blinkfeed which I don't really think lives up to the hype unless you're seriously into social media and the news. It is more of a Google Now for HTC rather than an actual feature. The bloatware is considerably reduced compared to other phones I've tried. You will immediately notice Kid Mode in the settings but it is actually connected to a literally useless app called Zoodles stuck on the phone. There's also an ugly app called Key VPN which is pretty much only useful under certain conditions. After that, the only thing you have to deal with is the usual Google stuff on every Android. The only problem with this is that it takes up a lot of the already small 8 GB along with the system, leaving behind less than 4 GB available for the user.<br/><br/>The actual OS--4.4 KitKat--is great with the smooth overlay of HTC Sense 5.5. Not to worry, you can quickly update to 5.0 Lollipop and Sense 6.0 in the software page. This phone has NFC and LTE both of which work fine. It is a Virgin Mobile phone and my experience with it has been good, except for when you first set it up and the app insists on completely resetting your homescreen and installing random apps. You can uninstall them thankfully.<br/><br/>My only problems with this phone are the storage and battery. Otherwise, it's amazing and I recommend it!
When I was looking for a replacement for my iPhone, I knew I wanted to go Android.  I also knew that I would be going with Virgin Mobile to save a ton of money each month.  So my phone choices were limited to the Android phones offered  by Virgin.  I had in mind a price target of around $200, so that further limited my choices.  I saw this phone and read as many reviews as I could find by professionals and "regular folks".  I decided to give this a try, and am glad that I did.<br/><br/>There are only a few things that I don't particularly care about with this phone, but those boil down to differences between IOS and Android.  (I vastly prefer Android, but Apple did get a few things right.)  But for the most part, I couldn't be happier.  Great functionality, great performance, great display.  I haven't had any glitches, crashes, or unexpected reboots.  This thing behaves quite well.<br/><br/>My primary recommendation for potential buyers is to start out with a decent-sized SD card, and then set all of your applications to record there.  The available on-board memory is largely consumed out of the box, leaving only about three GB or so available.  I bought a 32-GB card and don't worry about running out of memory, as I did with my iPhone, which locked me in to 16 GB with no way of expanding.<br/><br/>Another recommendation is to buy a good case and a screen protector.  The phone itself doesn't seem very sturdy with its plastic case, and the front and back are both fingerprint magnets.  Get a good case to protect it from jolts, drops, and scratches, and you'll have something that should last a long time.<br/><br/>Two of my sons saw my new phone and decided that's what they wanted for Christmas.  So I ended up buying a total of three.  All three of us are quite pleased with our phones and would recommend the 816 to anybody who asks.  We don't have any complaints at all.
Good phone I haven't had any major problems with the phone the camera quality is great, low rate plans and plus I've found many adorable cases that I love! Battery life could be better but I'm a heavy user I'm on my phone 24/7 so I can't really complain at all!!
I bought this from the same seller, but on eBay. I ended up getting it the next morning and was so excited. I had the Virgin Mobile LG Optimus F3. And don't get me wrong, I loved that phone. I had it for a year, but it had tea damage in my headphone jack, speaker (to hear people), and rear speaker so that was finally catching up to it. And I got a job and decided to spoil myself for my birthday and get this one. I was so blown away by just how big the screen was. After ab a week tho, you get use to it. Now it just feels comfortable to me. The lock button was really weird at first (it's placed on the left side above the volume keys) but it's easy to get use to almost right away. Battery is amazing. The F3 had a great battery for such a little phone, so if I was going to get another, it had to have equal or better battery life because lasting 2 days was what I was use to. And this one would definately last 2 days but I keep it charged because of work and school. People were complaining about the camera? The front is good, but it's really good. Like kind of too good for a front facing. It shows all detail. But I like it. The rear does take some getting use to. You just have to know how it works. But it's great. My bf loves watching videos on here because they're Crystal clear. The BoomSound is amazing. So clear, I love it. Phone performance, I keep my phone on 3g because 4g kills the battery and uses more data than necessary, so I keep it on 3g and its pretty fast. Gets the job done. Everything is smooth on this phone. A really great buy. I'll definately go with HTC in the future. :) oh! And it has actual emojis!
Just got this phone yesterday and woah this is the biggest phone I ever owned but it's perfect nice and sleek. .and I thought with the back it would look kind of cheap but in person it looks great. .I love the grey and black color. .I love this phone!
Bought 2, one for me one for wife, ADVISE, take some pictures as soon as you get it. One camera worked great !!!! one made every picture blueish/purple. Check camera when there is little light and flash must be used. If you get blue pictures, send it back, thank you amazon ! otherwise great phone for the price, also get a micro flash card, load any app that can be loaded to the card, to the card. Has good memory but a lot of memory is used by pre-loaded  non-removable apps and OS. Store all music and photos on card, I suggest 32 GB, they are cheap. I have 9000 songs and 3000 hd pictures on card and it still has 1/2 of its memory available. Now if you get a phone with KIT KAT, you can bypass the "lock screen", not the security screen. If it updates to lollipop, you must have both screens, pain in a@@. When you get it you will see what I mean. Kit Kat works great, lollipop does too, but it forces some things down your throat. (if you don't want to update, change update settings BEFORE connecting to internet, once you have lollipop you can't go back-even with factory reset. Yes, stupid lock screen bothers me that much, security screen is enough, I use pattern, but it will accept pin or face recognition. Do a tour of the internet. GOOD phone....Check camera first !!!! Seems to be a defect that HTC can't fix.I spent a lot of time "chatting" with HTC, camera is 13 MP and when working correctly is fantastic. Remember Amazon 30 day return.
I just recieved this phone and I have to say I like it a lot.  My current phone is an LG Optimus V which I purchased 7 March 2011.  Upgrading to this large modern smartphone is like a breath of fresh air.<br/>My opinion is WAYYY  BIASED because I am coming from such an OLD PHONE.<br/>Great screen, fast processor, tons of storage space (my LG has less than 300 MB on board storage)<br/>Yes of the 8GB on the phone, half is already used out of the box.  But that still leaves 4GB of on board storage.  That's awesome to me, because of the phone that I upgraded from.  Besides, I can put a 128 GB micro SD card in it if I want.  Win/Win.<br/>13MP camera, from my old 3.2 MP.  Amazing upgrade.<br/><br/>Only thing I was dissappointed with is that I was reading reviews about this phone all over the internet and I thought the phone was Dual SIM.<br/>The Virgin Mobile version of this phone is NOT Dual SIM.  This is not a huge issue to me, but I was looking forward to utilizing both SIM slots.  There is a rubber plug covering the second SIM slot.  I pulled it off and found the position for the slot, but no actual SIM slot behind the plug.  There is a reason why the VM version of this phone is less expensive that other carriers versions of this phone.<br/><br/>Not a big deal to me.  I am TOTALLY satisfied upgrading from my almost 4 years old LG to this current MODERN cell phone.<br/><br/>Please remember my bias when considering my review for this phone.
UPDATE 4-26-2015 This phone upgrades to 5.0.2 Lollipop but, don't pay over $180.00 for it.<br/>I couldn't justify spending over a grand for a device you could potentially lose. Your phone should not cost more than your desktop/laptop computer! While the majority is trying to get an iphone (overpriced & under featured) or a galaxy note 4 I took a chance on this phone & so far I do not regret it. The price can't be beat & I might just buy another as a backup phone should this one decide to go belly up. I did ALOT & I mean ALOT of research before pulling the trigger on this purchase. I almost foolishly blew over a grand for another phone that will be outclassed by its next model within a years time causing me to resale the phone on ebay just so I can get the newest model. The only 3 downsides that I can think of is 1.not water resistant 2.non removable battery & 3.small on board storage capacity so you will most definitely want to blow another $100 for a 128 gig storage card. I can't lie... I love the majority of the flagship phones that come out each year but I refuse to drop my hard earned cash for them. If you're on a budget and you don't have small hands & you're in the market for a phablet phone & you're okay with using an Android OS this is the phone to buy! The future way I see it with the prices of the flashship phones nowadays its going to get to the point where your phone will become your desktop computer & you just wirelessly connect to a monitor. Then & only then can I see spending over a grand for a flagship phone.
Hands down, this is the best phone I have ever owned. The price is stellar, and you are getting a lot of bang for your buck. The biggest selling point of this phone is the screen. Coming from an 3.5in screen iphone 4, it was refreshing to use a manageable yet impressive 5.5in HTC screen. The speakers, HTC boomsound, are forward facing and have strong bass. The camera, at 13 megapixels, is crystal clear and is easy to use. All of my friends always ask me to take pictures at events because they love the camera so much! The phone has a plastic back, which is durable and can easily be covered with a stylish case. I added a tempered glass screen protector and it's worked perfectly and saved my screen from accidents. The expandable storage of adding an sd card is excellent as long as you are in the habit of transferring your apps to your sd. The only issue I've ever encountered with my phone is messaging errors across devices with the default messaging app (i.e. with iphones). I suggest downloading the app "mysms" as your default messaging app right away. No issues since I've used mysms. Overall, choosing the HTC Desire 816 with Virgin mobile is a smart choice for your wallet with their monthly unlimited plans. I would recommend this phone to anyone looking for something comparable to the galaxy s6 or iphone 6 plus market, but at a much more affordable price with similar, if not better features.
I bought this phone for my wife a few months ago, and after she's had the ability to run it through it's paces, I think we can list a few pro's and con's.  But, to shorten up for those who don't want to read that far: for the money, it's very solid and serious value.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Sharp, bright screen.  I have an HTC One M8 myself, and compared side to side, they seem very similar in resolution and brightness.  Good legibility in daylight, text is easy to read, images are sharp, and video looks very good.<br/>- Quad-core processor is very good.  We have not noticed any real lags between applications.<br/>- Decent battery life.<br/>- Feels nice in your hand<br/>- Easy SD card expansion.<br/>- Decent sound from internal speakers<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- As with all Virgin Mobile devices, there are some apps you cannot disable or uninstall.<br/>- Internal memory: it has 8GB, which for the most part, should satisfy most users, but make sure to get an SD card to allow you to move applications to that storage.<br/><br/>Beyond those items, my wife nor I could think of any strong issues or nit-picks about the device.  HTC made a very solid mid-tier phone, that for the current selling price is a very solid deal for anyone using Virgin Mobile.  Unless you want the absolute latest device, stuck in the Apple ecosystem, or want to spend less, I would strongly suggest this model at this moment.
Purchased this device in early January 2015. Had intermittent wifi issues but the phone was great otherwise until 31 days after purchase it stopped connecting to cell towers. Sent the phone in for repair via HTC's warranty and they tried to swindle me out of $130 to replace the LCD screen. I called and complained asking what the heck the LCD screen had to do with data connection (by the way the LCD screen was immaculate but there was a crack on the plastic housing, see more below). So after dealing with their inept online chat and level 1 phone reps, I get a call from an American who assures me they'll fix the problem.<br/><br/>On February 12 I receive a refurbed phone from HTC. This one does connect to the cell towers but takes purple pictures. So I called to see what they could do about the purple pictures. I was told that this issued needed to be escalated and I'd get a call in 24 hours. About 5 days later I get a call while at work from HTC. Can't talk at work, they'll call back on Monday. Monday passes and 7 days later I get another call. Actually, they may have called sooner but the refurbed phone doesn't receive all calls. It seems as though every other call actually causes the phone to ring.<br/><br/>So I'm done.<br/><br/>Every phone I had previously purchased was an HTC but they won't get another penny from me. I bought a Samsung phone and we'll see how that goes.
Had this phone for about two weeks so far love everything about it. I moved from a Samsung S III. Did not think I was going to like this phone better than my Samsung devices. However so far I must say I really do.
Very,very nice phone.Hasn't slowed down,call quality is good ,music playa nice with the speakers.Well worth the price.Just get a sd card.The Virgin mobile service is v.good in my area 01109.LOVE PHONE AND SERVICE.
Update: After owning this phone now 8 months I hate it! Today I noticed that my phone hadn't updated 18 apps. So being like a normal breathing human I went to update it only I couldn't. It only allowed me to update 5 apps before being informed that I was out of memory. This was after I had spent 20 minutes clearing out my cache and removing 3 apps. These are the basic apps that come with the phone and if the phone doesn't have the memory to even update it then what's the point of this phone even?! It's exhausting with this phone. Save your money and get a better one!!!<br/><br/>I have enjoyed this phone for almost 2 months now. I thought coming from the Samsung S3 I wouldn't be able to adjust from the 4.8inch screen to the 5.5inch screen, that it would be too big. Once I got the phone though I never even noticed how much bigger the screen was. I feel in love with. The colors are bright and the picture is very clear. My only problem with the phone is that when in the sunlight the screen is hard to read. Its very washed out. Also the memory on the phone sucks. I bought a 32gb card to go with the phone but even after moving the apps that would let me move them to the card, I still only have 7.68gb left on the phone storage. That makes it hard to update the apps that need updated. Of course it's a Virgin Mobile phone so it's a lot of worthless apps I don't need.
I love the speakers on this phone, they sound as good as anyone could possibly expect a mobile phone to sound. I have a 128GB micro SD card for storing music, movies and books for offline use while traveling. There are services that will sell you the unlock code for $13, but you must have the IMEI number, which can be found by going to settings>About>Phone identity.<br/><br/>As a no carrier Android device, this is an exceptional value. I've ported my old landline number to Google Voice, and use Google Hangouts to make and receive phone calls over WiFi (single band 2.4 Ghz on this phone)  and when I am home I forward my mobile phone calls to this phone, so, when I am home, this is my phone.<br/><br/>The call quality is excellent, the front facing speakers are exceptional, the screen is quite nice, the camera can take very good photos but it is a bit awkward at times and doesn't take very good photos in low light. Full  1080p video recording is very good quality, and the stereo microphones should have been a standard smartphone feature years ago.<br/><br/>The phone has way too much useless HTC bloatware that can't be removed or moved to the micro SD card, short of rooting the device. With only 8 GB of internal memory, this is a real problem. The second SIM card slot has been physically blocked, which is just not cool.
<br/><br/>
If you're like me, you probably ended up here when your semi-reliable, affordable VM phone started looking dog-eared and battle damaged and the time came to look for an upgrade. Naturally, you tried going to your usual outlet in recent months, whether it's Virgin's own website or one of their affiliated stores (minus Radio Shack. Rip.) and have seen what a dismal selection of phones they've had available to buy lately. Seriously.....What the frick happened?? They used to have really great phones like This one, The Evo 3D, The Galaxy S3.....hell, iPHONES! Can't go wrong with those, right? Even if they do cost a pretty penny.<br/>Now all they've got is the LG Volt, The LG Tribute-to-the-Volt, A Windows phone (lol), Whatever latest plastic toy crap got foisted on them from Kyocera, and of course the Galaxy S5, if you're willing to part with a couple limbs, your immortal soul and your first born child (still a bargain compared to Verizon).<br/><br/>Between the lack of viable phones and the UTTERLY confusing discrepancies between their existing data plans, the custom plans and whatever the hell exclusive data plan thing they're doing with Wal-Mart which, by the way, uses many of the SAME [*bleep*] phones but somehow still requires a new account and a $20 starter kit, sometimes it's tough being a loyal Virgin Mobile customer who just wants a new phone.<br/><br/>Find your way here to get a hold-over phone like this one, though, and it reminds you why it's worth it.<br/><br/>Out of the box, it's already an impressive piece of hardware. Huge 5.5" HD Screen, 13 MP camera with a 5MP front-facing selfie cam, Loud dual front facing speakers, Blazing 4G LTE support and a Quad-core processor.  This phone eats other prepaid phones for breakfast and frightens pants pockets. And that's BEFORE the over the air upgrade from Android 4.4 Kitkat to 5.0.2 Lollipop that's available right off the bat. The HTC Sense overlay is present, of course, but is not as intrusive as previous iterations and you can get fairly close to a core android experience on this phone with some time and a few tweaks.<br/><br/>The only downer is the battery is integrated, so there's no swapping it out. If the charge retention of the battery goes down over long periods of use, you're stuck with it, just like with an iPhone.....but if you keep a charger handy, it shouldn't be a huge issue in the long run. The battery life is actually really good once you get rid of useless power sinks like the "Blinkfeed" on the homescreen.<br/>Also, this is a huge phone. Bigger than even the picture lets on.....so it may be prudent to invest in some protective casing and a holster for it. It won't fit in most pockets without risk of damage, so a holster is essential. I personally recommend the E-Time Armor case and holster (also available here for just $6.00). You will also need to get an SD card for storage space as it does not come with one and only has about 8 GB of on-board space that is already mostly occupied.<br/><br/>The way things have been going, this could very well be the last of Virgin Mobile's affordable, truly quality smartphones (for some time, at least), so, if you're in the market for one now, get this one while it's still available. You won't regret it.
No complaints at the moment. Switching over from iPhone 4S, and figuring out if I can get used to a 5.5 inch phone.<br/><br/>Considering the price, it's fantastic.<br/><br/>EDIT 09/22/2014: Removed one star due to a few quirks I've found with the phone as I've got used to it:<br/><br/>- The camera: It's laggy and it doesn't do very well at all in slightly dark conditions. Photos end up very grainy. It requires above average lighting. Other than that, it takes pretty amazing photos.<br/><br/>- Lock Screen Notifications: If you're switching from iPhone, you're gonna miss having notifications wake up your phone and display in the lock screen without having to unlock the phone, for example, when you get a text message. It's kind of ridiculous because I've seen HTC screenshots of other phones that do have this feature functional but for some reason it just would not work on this phone. I had to download a 3rd party app called Nils in order to get this feature, and then tweak and tweak until I got to function similar to an iPhone.<br/><br/>- Unnecessary notification icons: There's a lot of these occupying the notification space on the top of your device, and you can't turn them off. For example, the Alarm icon, and the Boomsound icon. I already know my phone has alarms active and that it uses Boomsound technology. I SERIOUSLY don't need it taking up space in my notifications. And it provides no way of turning them off unless you delve into developer stuff. Which I guess I could go into but come on, not everyone has the time or expertise of doing that.<br/><br/>- The battery: Not as good as people make it sound, but it's still better than my last iPhone 4S.<br/><br/>- Default picture-viewing (Gallery) app: Completely ridiculous and cumbersome. I don't know who came up with that garbage but whoever decided to have that as the picture viewing app needs to get fired from HTC immediately. I downloaded Quickpic instead.<br/><br/>- Choppy backlight: When you leave this phone on dim light to save battery, and then when you wake it up using the lock screen button, it doesn't light up smoothly. It's hard to explain. It's like it 'skips' brightness levels from off to dim instead of smoothly lighting up. But this only happens when you have low brightness levels though. But I've seen 50$ phones NOT do that so it's kind of amusing this happens with this phone.<br/><br/>- Default texting app and keyboard: Just suck. I downloaded Google Keyboard and Google Hangouts for SMS texting; much better and prettier.<br/><br/>- Location services is confusing: The location services icon is always present unless you completely turn if off, so I never really know if it's being used. But then if I need to use google maps I need to go back and turn it on. Why can't it be like iPhone where I allow location services on a per-app basis so it turns on by itself whenever it's needed? it's annoying. But I decided to just leave it on and I believe it's had no effect on my battery life so far it's not that big a deal.<br/><br/>NOW, SOME HIGHLIGHTS of what I've really liked about this phone to counter some of its shortcomings:<br/><br/>+ The form factor: It feels wonderful to hold this phone. It feels well built. (DO get a case though. Pray you won't get a crack if you drop your phone)<br/><br/>+ The screen: It's great to have all that extra space in this huge screen. And the pixel density is just perfect. (It's a bummer not being able to use the phone with one hand thought but I can't complain about that, it's to be expected from a phone this big)<br/><br/>+ Blinkfeed: A welcomed feature. I'm not a social media junkie and yet I've found it useful to check on my feeds without having to go on my apps individually. Perfect for a quick fix.<br/><br/>+ Boomsound: Amazing sound quality from the speakers, AND it also affects whatever you plug in the headphone jack. The technology isn't limited just to the phone's speakers.<br/><br/>+ Performance: Butter smooth performance.
I must admit I was skeptical because of the low price and being a third-party seller. Make no mistake. This Is the real deal! Brand new in the box. Retail packaging. 100% legit. 100% satisfied. Thank you!
I cannot tell you how happy I am that I purchased this phone.  Had been using HTC Evo 4G LTE for 18 months, but had to stop updating apps because its memory was full.  Found this at such a great price, read review after review and bought it.  You will want to get a case because this is a super slim and large phone; it feels far too delicate to hold by itself.  And buy the fastest and largest memory card to go with it.  Excellent quality picture and speed, and the sound is as good as they say.  Camera shots are instantaneous and great quality.  Because I updated from an HTC, moving apps, music, pics, texts, etc. was a breeze; they have you use an app that auto transfers everything wirelessly, just tap one button and watch it all move!  Battery is lasting a long time.  The best thing:  My old 4GLTE phone would not find 4G service in my rural area even though VM said it existed; this new phone has 4GLTE service throughout this entire valley.....  LOVE the speed!!  I also was able to use Talkback to read my overdrive books, which I couldn't do on the old phone.  With the auto-updates, it is running Android 5.0.2 and HTC Sense 6.0.  Note:  Before you turn it on the first time, follow the instructions and go to virgin mobile website to set it up.  Then turn it on and activation will be quick and easy.
This is my first phablet and second phone I've bought on VM. My old iPhone 4 was the worst thing I've bought on this service. This is a huge upgrade for me and I love it. Just an outstanding smartphone.
i had the  LG Volt before i got this one and by far has been the worst choice ever.  My battery dies so fast its unbelievable. For instance i unplugged my phone from the charger at 4:45 and now it is 9:19 AM and my battery is at 9% and i barley used it at all.
I've had this phone for 11 months now and it is still an incredible deal at the 199 dollars I paid and now Amazon is selling it for 50 dollars cheaper!<br/><br/>This is the first time that I've gone a year without new phone envy. To say I'm still in love with this phone is an understatement. The pictures are incredible; in fact, I have used images straight from my phone to the front page of my work's website. Google Now is flawless and quick. A few Siri users have been jealous of how well it works. The screen is large and clear, and the response rate is fast. Speakers are fairly loud, and maintain a lack of distortion as the volume rises. Battery life is surprisingly good, especially on standby mode, where I could go days without using the phone and not a drop of life is wasted. I can understand some people's issues with the left side buttons, but as a lefty, it works great for me!<br/><br/>The only issue, and it doesn't directly affect the phone itself, is finding a decent holster for it to hang from a belt, due to its size. I've gone through 3 of them already, but the phone is so worth getting, I just chalk it up to the cost of doing business. If you carry your phone in a purse or in your pocket, you'll have no troubles with this phone.
The screen is basically impossible to scratch, it is the fastest phone in the world, it takes professional grade pictures and it has AMAZING picture/sound.....I'm in love with this phone!!!
I periodically upgrade my phone on Virgin Mobile, and this is my 10th over the 7+ years I've been with them.  I upgraded from the HTC Desire 601, and before that I had the HTC EVO V 4G (I've taken a linking to HTC's phones).<br/><br/>The Desire 816 is an absolutely great phone.  If the size of the phone is the only thing holding you back, then bite the bullet and get this phone; you won't regret it.  This phone is the best value on Virgin Mobile at the time of this writing.  I was able to get it here on Amazon for $149.00, but I've never seen it for more than $200.00.  Just get it and be happy.<br/><br/>You need to get 3 other things with this phone:<br/>1) a case (the phone does not have gorilla glass)<br/>2) a TEMPERED GLASS screen protector, NOT some cheap plastic one (remember this phone doesn't have gorilla glass)<br/>3) an SD card for storage<br/><br/>Pros: Very fast, Beautiful big screen, ANDROID 5.0 (Lollipop), HTC Sense 6, Great back (13MP) AND front (5MP) camera, GREAT battery life, Nice build quality.<br/><br/>Cons: Still only 8 gigs internal, no gorilla glass, back of phone loves fingerprints (just get a case)
The memory on the phone sucks, I only had the phone for less then a month and got the low memory alert. I wound not purchase this phone again or recommend it to anyone.
I absolutely love this phone, I ordered it on the 5th and got it on the 7th.it was a birthday gift for me and I got it eirly.nice size and it takes beautiful pictures
HTC desire 816 is a huge step up from my LG phone from virgin mobile. Great battery life, lot of room aps, excellent sound quality and love the quality of the photos.
This is a great phone, especially for developers. HTC will help you root the phone, this has XDA support, Custom recovery with CWM and Cyanogen Mod has a stable rom for this running KItKat 4.4.4.<br/><br/>I have two of these in my house. One is mine, the other is my wife's.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Fast, reliable, unbelievably good sound, sufficient internal storage plus SD. Camera is great, battery is awesome. My wife had hers running for two days in normal mode without having to charge it.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>Case Selection - I have three cases for this phone. Luckily my wife liked one of them so she uses it, the other is a StihlGut leather case that is cumbersome, and the one I use now is the Amzer puddin case. It is slim, grippy and gives pretty good protection. Of course, get a glass cover for the screen as well.<br/><br/>Stock ROM for HTC has so many icons on the top bar that you care nothing about. It is a cluttered mess. One rooted, you can pretty much hide most of them, and a custom rom is great for this thing, but it looks like HTC just threw every icon in the world at this phone.
I have had this phone for about 3 months now, and am finally ready to discuss.<br/><br/>This is one of the best phones I've used. I have compared it with Iphones, Samsung Galaxies, and Nokias - all much more expensive, but they barely measure up. I urge you to give this phone a try over any other phone on Virgin's network. You will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>I still can not believe the amount of phone I got for the money. I have never been one for the latest-and-greatest electronics, wait a while, and you'll have a better time figuring out what you're getting. This phone has met all my expectations, and beyond.<br/><br/>THE PROS:<br/>--- The screen is large and crisp, colors are saturated. Beautiful. The glass seems to resist finger prints exceptionally well.<br/>--- Navigation, quick-access settings and notifications are very easily and quickly accessible. So very easy to use.<br/>--- The camera is pretty neat, although you do have to get used to the shutter speed. Camera allows for some manual adjustments. Pictur... Read more
My husband and I both upgraded to this phone. We cant find one negative thing about it! Pictures are perfect.. and the battery time is good. Love the larger size and we're both super happy with it!
I've had this phone for about four months now and overall it is a really great phone, especially for the price.<br/>First off, the battery life is amazing. I can go into work at 8 AM, listen to music all day, play games and check social media during my lunch break, and still have over 60% battery by the time I get off of work at 4 PM. Even with heavy usage I typically still have about 20-30% battery by the time I go to sleep. My old iPhone would be dead even before I left work.<br/>Next, the size of this screen has ruined me from ever going back to a smaller phone. I actually laughed when I first saw how big this phone is, but it very quickly grew on me. If you have smaller hands then it may be a bit difficult trying to type with just one hand, but the size and quality of the screen are definitely worth it.<br/>With the incredible sound quality (this phone has something called Boom Sound) and the great graphics on the larger screen, it's much more comfortable to stream videos when compared to m...

Arrived way before scheduled date, phone was in perfect unopened box with everything that the standard virgin mobile phone comes with. Currently using the phone myself and its amazing. Camera especially but, tends to be a lil shaking and takes slight time to adjust but otherwise perfect for me and my semi- busy and social life. Comes with latest 4.4.2 android and awesome google now voice capability that once you say the key phrase "OK google" from any screen it will immediately start searching and/ or activate your request. This needs to first be activated in the settings of the google now app but once active will be a lifesaver . Also, just to add this phone has fast start-up and if you are switching from another phone it comes built it with this HTC transfer tool that allows you to transfer everything over to this one but, if transferring from an Android you need to download that app first on your old phone and I think for iPhones you need to transfer your info to a PC then transfer via USB cable.
I just got this phone a couple days ago after needing to upgrade and I love it. I couldn't pass up the cheaper than retail price and I'm so glad I bought it. I was mainly looking for something with a bit more memory than my old one as well as a better camera as I'm into photography and take lots of pictures, a lot of places don't allow DSLR's or point & shoots depending, but phones are usually good to go. The camera on this thing is awesome. I love having control over the exposure and even the front-facing camera is pretty good quality at 5MP.<br/><br/>The phone is huge, which I like, I'm not a heavy app user so I've still got about 4gb of memory left, plus I got a 32gb micro sd card so that helps too. The battery life seems good to me, granted I haven't had it long, but since I'm not on my phone a lot as it is, then it doesn't drain quickly. I'm a fan of power saving mode too, at night, I put it in extreme power saving so I only get calls or texts and my alarm will go off in the morning.
Best phone I have ever owned.  fast, sleek, and exciting.  I love it.  Set up was a breeze and it accepted my old phone's data saving me a lot of time.
It's a low budget phone I was satisfied to have purchased. I had thought 8GB of on-board storage was plenty. But I've learned an external micro sd card will not make up for the performance of plenty of internal storage. I'll take this phone as a learning experience to remember to not accept anything less then 16GB of internal memory to avoid performance issues of using an external micro sd card to make up for running out of internal space.<br/><br/>The phone is large, but the 720p screen does have it's limitations and I've been disappointed with the screen readability in bright sunlight. Also as with all HTC phones, the back camera just isn't as good as the competition from other Android manufacturers like Samsung.<br/><br/>Big phones are here to stay as smart phones are the most personal and used computer we own. But I really would have been happier with a smaller phone as 5.5" screen is slightly larger then my pants or shirt pocket will hold.
For the price and functionality of this phone, IT IS A 5 stars!  This phone is great that I had to buy a second one for a relative.<br/><br/>STRENGTH:  Great alternative to expensive phone such as Galaxy S5 or Note 4.  Only cost about 1/3 of them. Screen just mm shy of Note 4, but overall physical shape is mm larger than the Note 4. Naked eye can't tell much different on screen resolution between high-end and this phone, why spend more? HTC signature of two speakers (stereo) not mono. Fast response. HTC ZOE--The best Music player I ever had, music screensavers, lyrics if the songs are available - download album artwork etc.<br/><br/>WEAKNESS: Android- a customizable OS, but has great limitation than Windows. Kit Kat OS now can't copy files  to SD (Google's idea?) unless use PC w/micro adapter in  transfer files, via usb cable often crash. 4GB remaining internal storage. Glass screen is very fragile, get tempered glass or other screen protector.
Aweaome phone! I love that its so thin and such a nice camera. Both are nice. Its so big and pretty. I just love it would recommend to everyone.
Love this phone!!! Amazing deal on a great product!! Would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a great phone at a bargain deal!
This is simply a great smart phone for the price your paying. It is fast but I have noticed some lag in games and busy websites. The camera is clear and takes he pictures but is not good in low light. I suggest buying an sd card since the internal memory storage is 8 gb. At first I was worried about the massive size since I have very small hands. However, I quickly got used to it and holding any phone smaller than this one feels weird XD. I chose the 45$ plan from virgin mobile and I regret nothing. Since this is a no contract phone, I am paying less than half of what I used to when I was with a contract service. This phone is perfect for someone who is not looking for something super high end. It is perfect for social media users because of the clear and big screen and the excellent camera. Also, if your a music lover this is the phone for you. The souls quality is crisp and the boom speakers are loud and clear.
I have had this phone 4 weeks now. I am totally in love with this model. I would almost say the phone is perfect. Except for two small details. 1). The phone does have a small glitch. After swiping my security pattern to unlock the phone. Instead of defaulting to the home screen. My phone defaults to "Get Google Now". So I need to click the return key twice each time to exit that app and get to the home screen. Is that really a major flaw on the phone? Too me it isn‘ t and the phone out performs my former Samsung Galaxy IIIs. 2). The battery is not replaceable on this phone. So once the battery starts to die on this phone. I can expect a high price to replace the battery. Hopefully by that time I will use my 2 year warranty I bought on the phone. Aside from those things I love this phone. I will stick with the HTC One type of phones. Mainly because they produce great sounds thru the front firing speakers. Update: 11/11/2015. I still own this cell phone and I love it. The visuals and camera are beautiful. I originally fell in love with the front firing stereo speakers. But for some reason about 6 months ago, it seems my stereo sound isnt as powerful or maybe the stereo isn't as stereo as it used to be. Regardless this phone is still a pleasure to buy. And when I bought this phone last year, the cost was $218.99. Now this phone costs only $149.99 and I am considering to buy a new replacement. This is my favorite phone only because I am too cheap to buy the M9 model. But I would love to have the M9. I have too admit I am super cheap because this year I just recieved over $115k in bonus money. And here I am crying about paying a little under $500 for the M9 from HTC. So yes I am a cheap person and I admit it, but the 816 model is a super deal! By the way I just purchased another 816 Desire to replace the one I have. I loved the power and sound of my speakers. But since mine somehow lost the power and stereo sound. Buying a new one at this lower price is a great deal in my opinion!
The HTC Desire 816 is an incredible combination of great processing, good visuals, an incredible camera, and unprecedented sound, in a thin, light, low-cost package. There were very few drawbacks to this phone, which are at most, minor annoyances.<br/><br/>When writing about recent HTC phones, the first thing to address is the sound. You have never heard anything like these incredible yet small speakers with built-in amps. The sound quality is so good, that I now prefer to hear must from the speakers on this small phone than the dual-speaker/single sub-woofer stereo system attached to my computer, or from my best headphones. When HTC says sound quality, they don't just mean the loud rumbling bass that is now commonly mistaken for "sound quality." The sound projects and surrounds, it perfectly separates channels, and it plays the deepest bass and the highest treble with perfect tone!
I actually have ordered 2 of these phones. 1 for my son for Christmas and then a few months later 1 for myself. The phone is a little large for me as I have little hands and I am about 5'2, but perfect for my son who is 6'1. It's very thin and the features are great. I am in love with the speakers on the phone very loud. Battery life is awesome I go about 3 to 4 days without charging at all. I have a few apps that I use daily and listen to music all the time and the battery so far has been great. Storage it also great I had transferred my pictures from my other phone to this one and it was almost 1000 pics as well as my contacts and I still have plenty of storage on the phone and SD card.<br/>Only complaint I have is that there are no good phone cases for this phone. Like otterbox, survival anything like that. I can only find cheap covers that really do not protect the phone.
So far after my first few days this phone is awesome. It reminds me a lot of my old note 2. It is the same size and pretty much the same functionality. I had turned off most of the gimicky things off the note anyways as all they really did was drain the battery. The screen is very nice, very responsive to swipes. Opens apps and plays games like fruit ninja with out a problem. As some have also said the only thing that I may say is bad is the battery life. It doesn't have the longest life span before getting drained. For all the other good things so far from this phone for how much I paid for it, it is a very minor complaint. Also another thing that I noticed on this phone that I haven't seen on other phones is that when one makes a call, it seems to boost the signal. I will have one bar and then make a call and it jumps to 4 or 5 bars then back down when the call is done.
Absolutely love this phone. I got the wallet case and its great. It is a two hand phone. Great definition. Awesome speakers. Love it.
Very nice phone. Upgraded from old virgin mobile HTC evo v 4g. It's a HUGE difference in every aspect. Very quick and responsive. After a couple days I noticed slightly tapping torwards top of phone it will make a little vibrating sound like something is broken inside, hoping it's just defective, already ordered a replacement. Nice big screen and good sounding speakers. Not very good selection on cases but found a otterbox look alike on Amazon for $8.50. My only real down side is the battery is non removable and will someday need replacment or disposal. That being said for a 2600 mah battery it's not bad at all. And I was used to my 3000 mah battery from sedio for evo v 4g. For the price I paid $177 it is well worth it considering a galaxy s5 is like $500 and this thing is as big as the iPhone 6 +. Comfortable with my last HTC this one is no different!<br/><br/>Edit - received new phone still has a slight vibrating sound torwards top of camera when tapped on. Does not affect phone performance. And I guess android 5.2 lollipop is only going to be for the dual SIM version. The virgin mobile version which I have will stay at kit Kat 4.4 still a great phone. Love it!!<br/><br/>Edit- as of 04/18/2015 I have successfully updated to Android lollipop 5.0.2. Nice little changes and very glad it came to the virgin mobile edition as well.
The phone is great, I'm the type of person to do my homework before purchasing any type of device, and this phone has come to be great, but not perfect. As far as specs, everything goes hand in hand. Except for one thing, personally I love taking pictures and as far as the rear camera, with its 13 megapixels, it has yet to fail me. But when it comes to the front camera, although the specs say 5 megapixels, it didn't mention that the front camera seems to be zoomed in. If my arms were 2 feet longer, I'd be happy, but they're not and I'm not too pleased. Even at full arms length, my selfies come out too close. The internal storage isn't my favorite either. Although I try moving everything to my external SD card, it still doesn't give me enough space. HTC uses a lot of space and the RAM isn't enough. But overall, the phone is pretty good. I'd recommend.
Love, Love, Love this phone. Huge screen. Great interface. Great sound from the tiny speakers. Can't say enough good things about this phone. Hands down the best Virgin Mobile phone available, save perhaps the Iphone and Galaxy. In a sea of crap phones that Virgin Mobile offers, this bad boy is the shark. Now for the question I'm sure everybody want's to know. How much memory is left after all of the forced bloatware. After moving everything to SD that I could and only having Facebook, Amazon Music, Amazon Shopping, and Pandora on my phone as apps that weren't included, and after all the forced VM updates, I have used 6.61gb of 8. That's nearly one and a half gigs of on phone space on a VM phone. This is unheard of outside the iphone and galaxy. Get this phone!!!! Never will you find a better phone for the price, especially for Virgin Mobile.
Just got mine last Monday,  I love it! I had a Galaxy s2 previously and I have always sworn by Samsung but the price caught my eye on this phone.  I have no regrets,  the battery life out  does my Galaxy by far,  I was able to go two full days without a charge and plugged it in at 25% not even flashing for low battery yet. While large,  with a good case,  the phone fits comfortaby in my hands.  The display is great,  the sound is outstanding, the GPS connects almost automatically when needed,  my apps run smoothly with no glitching or  lag,  and the main camera takes beautiful pictures with its 13mp  camera.  The only thing I don't like is the front facing camera,  it's pictures come out grainy  and unfocused,  at least in the standard camera  app,  I have not tried it through an external app yet.  All in all a great buy for a great price.
I wanted to find a phone with a great camera on it but wasn't too expensive. This said it has a 13 mp camera so that was the sole reason I bought it. It does take some good outdoor photos but I'm not impressed at all with how it takes the pictures while I'm inside. I must have missed the part where it said the size of the phone because I was shocked with how big it was. It is something I'm still trying to get use to. The one thing I absolutely hate about this phone is the storage space. I have a 16gb sd card in the phone and transfered everything possible to the card but yet I have no room at all on the phone. I can't even update half my apps because there's no room to do so... Even the apps that are on the sd card. It tells you to clear the cache to free space but that gets annoying to do multiple times a day just so I can use stuff.
Bought this to replace an HTC Evo 3D that was malfunctioning. Screen-size on this phone is pretty big (and beautiful) and the battery goes for over a day with normal use which is a huge improvement over the Evo. I actually fixed the Evo recently and contacted Virgin Mobile who said I could still use it as needed as often as desired without incurring any swapping fees. So I can take the Evo skiing where a smaller phone would be more practical and use the 816 for workdays, etc. - great to be able to switch as desired. I bought the little leather case and a glass screen protector and they seem to function just fine. It's only been a week of ownership but there are no cons that come to mind other than the size is too large for some activities. My daughters and friends with the over-priced phones were very impressed with the 816 - envy....
I am so happy I made this purchase.  I love this phone.  I have had 2 iPhones and a Galaxy and this one is my favorite.  The camera is gorgeous and it's fast and smooth.  BATTERY LIFE NOTE: As it comes shipped it sucks... won't make it a day. Go turn on power saving mode and it makes a world of difference and I don't see that it is acting any differently than before... no compromise that I can see.  The inactive battery saver at night is AWESOME if you forget to plug it in.  It's the first phone that plays nice with my car's bluetooth system and streams my music from Google Play.. FINALLY.  At this price and for $35 bucks a month unlimited this is the smartest fiscal decision you can make with a phone... just BE SURE that you BUY AN ADDITIONAL SD CARD or you will run out of memory real quick like. :-)  Only a slight learning curve.
I love this phone it is great and fast. It was well worth the price. The camera and boomsound is amazing. Watching videos in HD IS AWESOME! Great phone 💗
I love this phone.  It's a great deal.  It's very fast, speakers are loud and clear, and 5.5" screen very big. It is the best phablet for the bargain.
Waited a month before writing review and it's now a month so here it is,<br/>I LOVE THIS PHONE!  I wont go into great details other than to say if you are looking for a large clear screen, responsive phone, and the latest droid version it's all here.  Not a single complaint and few "I wish this did or was likes".. So few I won't even get into them.  Honestly, if you want a phone that runs with the big dogs and will cost you half or even less this is it.  Feel free to direct any questions you might have at me and I'll do my best to answer as I understand this review is pretty simple however, again, I have absolutely only good things to say so that leaves little to actually be said.<br/>Get one before the market realizes just what's being sold for well under $250 here...
Yes, the screen is huge and the slightest bit cumbersome but when youre sitting around killing time on Netflix its worth it. Speaking of killing time, the Boomsound speakers on either end are awesome for listening to music. I find myself just turning Pandora on the phone, placing it on the kitchen counter and doing the dishes. No need for a Bluetooth speaker now... If you like having a very nice phone with almost all the features of the actual flagship but dont mind a few cut corners to keep the price reasonable this phone is an exellent choice. A big beautiful screen, good sound for music and video, a 13MP rear and 5MP front camera with a quad-core processor and 1.5GB or RAM make this the perfect phone for someone not wanting to drop $500-$600 on a One or S5. Im in love.
Very nice mid-range android phone. Quite large. Not really a pocket phone. My last HTC was 4.5 inches and fit well in my front pocket. I use a holster and case for this "beast". It's bigger than I had imagined it to be. I purchased on Amazon without seeing it first. It's not a bad thing that the phone is huge, just keep it in mind if you keep it in your pocket. It's fast, smooth, loud, and has a very nice screen. The battery lasts me all day with basic usage (a couple calls, some texting, some web, and emailing). It does eat battery fairly quick if you do video streaming. The BOOM sound is nice. I really like HTC and Virgin Mobile. They work well together. The battery IS NOT removable. I would have preferred a replaceable battery, but for this price and the quality phone you are getting, its a great value and a nice product. I would definitely buy this again if mine breaks or something happens to it.
I don't get the latest greatest phones, so for around $200.00 this was a good deal. The screen is large, the camera and video work great. While a fairly big phone the weight is very light. The processor in this phone is very snappy. I have no lag between actions. I recently forgot to plug it in overnight, waking up the next day I was very concerned as my last phone (Samsung Galaxy 3) always ran out of charge if I didn't plug it in overnight, much to my amazement, only about 2% of the battery had drained. Excellent battery life!<br/>I had a HTC thunderbolt a few years back and have always loved the quality of their phones.<br/>PRO's<br/>Excellent Battery life<br/>Excellent Camera and video<br/>Excellent performance<br/><br/>CON's<br/>None I can think of
Pros:<br/>Very fast<br/>Very clear and loud speakers - very low distortion<br/>Very bright screen<br/>Very light weight<br/>Large phablet screen<br/>Great battery life (can use it for over 2 days moderately, with still around 20% charge remaining)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Even though the front looks great, the back looks cheap because of the shiny plastic (which is a fingerprint magnet). I'd recommend a case for this phone, which hides most of the back.<br/><br/>A few things to be aware of:<br/>Since the battery is relatively large, the 1A - 5VDC charger will take a while for a full charge.<br/>Because of the large screen, it is slightly difficult for people with small hands to operate it. It also doesn't fit into small pockets.
The Desire 816 in my opinion is one of the best phones on virgin mobile. First off the screen is a nice roomy 5.5 inch 720p display with great viewing angles and a crisp picture. Second the htc boom sound speakers sound full and rich with a decent amount of bass. Third the rear facing camera is a 13 mp shooter with flash which takes very detailed pictures and the front facing camera is a 5 mp which takes some pretty good selfies. Fourth the snapdragon 400 processor is quick and snappy. The only cons I have for this phone is the funky power button placement and the fingerprint magnet back. But overall this phone is a great mid range phone and is worth checking out a 4 out of 5.<br/><br/>P.S. Not a phone for those with little hands.
So, its a big...BIG beautiful phone.  Great speakers, great camera and huge pretty screen is what I was looking for and what I got...threw some eco power saving apps on and keeps the battery going as long as I need it to.  Best phone I've ever had.  A nice cheap replacement for my doomed iPhone.<br/>But.  There is a always a but.<br/>BUT.  The headphone jack seems really loose, the audio plug to my car speakers slides out all the time...very annoying.  And now, like 4 weeks after I got the phone, the SIM card popped out and won't stay in.  Push it in...pops out. My temp fix is i have the card cover taped down, but, that's an issue.  I will update if i'm able to resolve these issues with tech support.
I am in love with my HTC desire 816.  I love the size of this phone. It fits perfectly in my hands.  The location of the power and volume buttons at the top left of the phone doesn't bother me at all.  They never get in my way when making calls.  The calls on this phone are so much clearer than they were on my Samsung Galaxy II phone.  Also better is the larger qwerty keyboard letters.  I can text much quicker now and the hands free microphone picks up the words with a better accuracy.  Ap downloading is really fast as is music downloading.  Picture qualify is excellent, very clear.  The selfie function is very handy.  Overall I would recommend this phone and I will not be trading any time soon.
Battery Life is very good when compared to the old HTC EVO.  Screen size is phenomenal.  The only down side is that when I received the phone in August, and did an HTC system/phone update, Dot View got installed.  When I called VM to see if its compatible with this phone, they said no, so my next question was, if it doesn't work how do I remove it from my phone?  Well needless to say after following the steps of resetting the phone, Dot View is still there, (nonfunctional and taking up needed much space on the phone).  Other that that, I like the phone and would purchase again.  Be sure you get a case (for the back, so you don't have all those fingerprints) and tempered glass protector though.
Awesome phone, one of the best virgin mobile phones I have had, great speed, and overall a great product.
I previously had the LG Volt through Virgin Mobile, and it had all kinds of bugs and issues. This phone works like a charm. It is huge! I knew that it would be big, but actually receiving it, I can't believe how big it looks (I am 5'2 and have tiny hands haha). I would give this phone a 5 if it weren't for some weird layout issues. Unlike other Android models, this phone does not have a menu key on the home page. I find that odd. I also think that the lock screen could be more customizable. I have seen far less superior phones with better customization. But, overall this is a fabulous non-flagship phone. I am very happy with my purchase, and would definitely recommend to a friend.
I've had this cell phone for a little under a year and I find there's much to be desired. The battery life is average to poor (especially when programs are running). I'll have it fully charged and then turn on my GPS and check back and see the battery life lowered to 73% within 10 minutes. The limited storage has affected my ability to even download any sort of apps whatsoever. Constant updates have taken up a majority of my available cell phone space and despite calling customer service and factory-restarting my phone, the issue doesn't go away. There's a constant reminder of limited space available and the amount of RAM used (85% used... ,etc).<br/><br/>1/10, don't recommend.
I've been looking for a phone with a 'large' screen so I can see things on it better and this phone fits the bill. Nothing fancy about it aesthetically (stock black) but picture quality is excellent and speakers are in the front so I can hear on it better. And the price was right for a prepaid phone of this size. (Note: I don't believe this has 'gorilla' glass as it states in small print on the packaging that if it's dropped the glass will break. So I'll just be careful (as I would do with any phone!). Phone has a non-removable battery (for those who like to install battery 'extenders' - no can do with this one!).<br/><br/>Happy with this purchase. 4 stars.
Before I bought I read a few reviews and watch some review videos for the phone. I have to say I live everything about it. I switched over from Apple to andrioid. And I have to say HTC is the way to go. People say the power button is in an awkward spot. But since it's my first android phone I couldn't tell. Love the 13 mega pixel camera. It's a great mud range phone. I've been using it for a few months now. And it doesn't appear to be mud range. Only downside of the phone is the glossy finish at the back. I'm a scratch freak when it comes with phone I bought a goria glass and a skin for the back so I can use it without a case. This phone is worth the money.
When my Samsung Galaxy S3 fell and the screen cracked, it rendered the phone useless. I was in dire need of a replacement phone that I could use on a day to day basis. I compared all the options I had and this phone stood out to me. It has stellar specs and it looks nice too. It feels a little cheap in the hand because of its plastic build but after adding a metal case, it feels much better.<br/><br/>From my experience of using this phone every single day for many months (since November 2014), I can honestly recommend this to anyone looking for a good phone on Virgin Mobile USA.<br/><br/>Note: You should buy a microSD card as this is only an 8GB phone.
Absolutely love love love this phone so much in fact that I also ordered my son one he loves it too
I like this phone after getting used to the humongous size.  I didn't realize how BIG it was when I ordered it.  Fits in my pocket so that works, but probably would not fit in a woman's pocket.<br/><br/>Screen is NOT gorilla glass, I put a scratch on mine within a week.  make sure you use a screen protector.<br/><br/>Function is really good, I wish the phone keyboard/call list was more like my older EVO was and showed more names at one time, my only complaint.  otherwise, works great, very speedy with all my apps, takes great video and picture, actually took better pictures in some strange lighting situations than my Nikon D3100 on a recent trip.
Love this phone, did get use to how big it is. Now I don't want to go back to a smaller phone lol.<br/><br/>Only really downfall on this phone is two common issues with this phone.<br/><br/>1. The SIM card - it will pop out all the time and not stay in.. I've tried so many times to keep it in there now it's kinda damaged the SIM card. So because it won't stay in I used tape to keep it closed. This is a common problem with the phone.<br/><br/>2. Battery life- It sucks.. drains fast, esp when it comes to videos or games. Probably will want to buy a portable charger for this phone.<br/><br/>But yes I do love this phone and suggest it 😁
Feels so cheap and breakable but odds are youll put a case on it anyway so your good there the display has terrible motion blur problems so if you wanna take video with the camera forget about it the interface is pretty snapy very rarely lags battery life lasts me a full day so thats good and the memory is what really kills thos device cant have hardly any apps on this thing because the os takes up 5gb!!! So that amoung other things i have less than 1gb of apps on my phone and its already telling me im out of space like are you kidding me probably gonna upgrade again and hasnt even been a year already sick of this thing
So far I love this smartphone. It's actually the first smartphone I ever owned so I am not sure I have anything to compare it to. The only (minor) issue is its size. It's seriously huge so be warned if that's not what you're looking for. This is what people call a "phablet." Another thing, is the battery life doesn't seem very long and there is quite a bit of bloatware. I hear these are common problems with most smartphones though. I suppose one could always rootkit it and remove all the unwanted stuff.<br/><br/>As far as I am concerned this is an amazing phone for this price.
I just got my phone on Friday, Dec 12, 2014. I went through the exact same thing as another customer with Smith disabled. Amazon sent me a new one (really fast). It just arrived today. Opened it up, and right out of the box, I got the Smith notification again. I haven't had any other negative experiences with the first phone. Took it off the charger this morning around 6:30. Carried it to work all day and spent some time on Facebook and Amazon. It still has 68% over 13 hours later. If everything else keeps working fine, I can say it's an overall great upgrade from my old HTC Desire.
The sound and etc was awesome, but the giant size of the phone makes my hand sore literally.  I think they make this phone just a little smaller in HTC 6** some number.  I'd prefer that because jeeze  just buy a real tablet this is a very heavy phone with a case on it.  The memory 8gb and thats not enough bc the bloat wear is stuck on phone.  The android update is 1gb....not cool, and it took some work to move my music to sd card from Amazon mp3, and the stock program.  Anyway I know I would be happier with the smaller version.  Proceser is great tho considering.
THIS IS MY SECOND HTC PHONE AND IT PERFORMS FLAWLESSLY. I REALLY LIKE HAVING THE LARGER SCREEN, IT MAKES TEXTING AND WEB BROWSING MUCH EASIER  THE CAMERA TAKES EXCELLENT PICTURES EVEN IN LOW LIGHT CONDITIONS.<br/>  THE CALL QUALITY IS VERY GOOD, I HAVE NO PROBLEMS HEARING WHO EVER I'M TALKING TO AND THEY SAY I SOUND NICE AND CLEAR. I'M ALSO HAPPY WITH HOW FAST THIS PHONE IS. VERY GOOD DOWN LOAD AND UP LOAD SPEEDS. I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH SOUND QUALITY OF THE FRONT SPEAKERS, THE MUSIC HAS A NICE RICH SOUND ALONG WITH BEING NICE AND LOUD WHEN YOU NEED TO TURN IT UP. I HAS NOT SURE I WOULD BE HAPPY WITH A PHONE THIS LARGE BUT I'M GLAD I BROUGHT IT. IT IS THIN AND LIGHT AND FEELS GOOD IN YOUR HAND. I'M VERY SATISFIED WITH MY PHONE.
Awesome phone!! Great speakers, huge screen, only setbacks is the fact you can't take battery out if or when it goes bad on u. You would have to purchase new phone. SIM card pops out often and internal memory is 8gb but unless u root it and get rid of all the preinstalled apps u will have no space to download apps. I've got a 16 gb SD card but no apps will transfer to it because as u know any app u download has to go on internal memory before you can transfer it. Otherwise, it's a great phone. I had a LG volt and this phone blows it out of the water.
I've had this for a year & love it. I bought it along with the handmade "Stilgut" leather flip case, the "Skinomi" HD Screen protector, & a 32gb memory card. It's still running like its new. Battery life is still good, the speakers are still awesome & the best that exist on any smartphone, camera takes phenomenal pictures, & it has no issues running any games. The only issue I have is I hate how Google forces you to use up so much memory with all their bloatware apps so I might jailbreak it so I can delete all the extra junk.
Amazing phone. Absolutely worth the price. Fantastic battery life, even with OK Google from any screen, and comes outfitted with a nice quadcore processor. My only gripe is the lack of a removable battery, but the upside to this is that the phone has a really nice aesthetic and feels really smooth. Also, my favorite part about the phone is how much friction the back part has: I can hold it using only my fingertips at about an 80º angle. All in all, an incredible phone that is second only to the S5 in terms of what Virgin Mobile has to offer.
I bought this for my dad and he loves it He has bad eyesight so the large screen is great for him. it runs everything smoothly but of course with a large screen comes a sucky battery life but that is to be expected. My dad's last phone was the sharp aquos crystal from boost mobile and this was miles better. The last one had terrible call quality and this one has great call quality. we have been with a lot of carriers over the years and the two best ones for call quality in Wisconsin have been Virgin Mobile and US Cellular.
Love the phone so far! Nice sized screen, vibrant colors, sound is awesome, front facing and rear camera is lovely even with dim light ! Only 2 things that I don't like 1. I can't press the spacebar without accidentally hitting the home button instead 2. The power and volume buttons are too close together and sometimes I'd hit the wrong button (try to turn the volume up and accidentally lock my phone!). Otherwise I love it....and it comes with all the emojis I can think of ! No more downloading an emoji keyboard app. 👍
So far I really like it. The camera is pretty good, as long as you have good lightening. For the price it is a must have. Far superior to other phones in a similar price range. So far not laggy. This phone is pretty big but you get used to it quickly. I was afraid that it wouldn't fit in my pockets but it does even if it sticks out a bit. The lock button on the left side was easy to get used to. It doesn't bother me at all. Overall, I love it. It's the size of an iPhone 6 plus and it's one third of the price. Amazing.
I read a lot of reviews before making this purchase. I have been using this phone for a week now, and I am so very happy I brought this phone. I love this phone. The camera is great! The size is not too big. I was concerned that the size was going to be clunky in my hand, but it is very easy to hold. The display on this phone is very clear. The colors are bold and graphics are great! if you are looking for a mid priced phone that can compete on some levels with the higher price phones this is a good phone to buy.
The phone is great. Very nice photos with it. The only drawback is storage. Although you can add a microSD card to add storage which is great for photos and such. Many of the apps can't be moved to the SD card so the phone memory gets full pretty fast. It's a bummer becaust you can't even update the apps when memory is almkstt full. Bottom line if you use many apps like I do then you'll feel limited but if you only use a couple apps and mainly want a phone that takes decent photos , then this phone is great.
Im so happy I bought this phone. I was hesitant due to the screen size, thought it was too big. Now I can't imagine going back to a 4.5 inch screen. Setting up with virgin mobile and transferring my info from previous VM phone was a breeze. The screen size is great, fantastic quality, videos and web pages load very fast. I put a 32 gig micro SD card which was incredibly easy to install in the side slot.  The camera takes great photos and videos. Battery life is decent. Can't recommend this phone enough.
Ive had this phone for a few months now and its holding up well. An upgrade from my lg volt, it has shown me no lag, great reception, and great battery life. For the price this phone is a steal.<br/><br/>Pros: Snappy Performance, Massive screen (perfect for my giant hands), Android Lollipop. 13 mp Camera is a boss.<br/><br/>Cons: Relatively Average battery life. Can still get me through a full day 6 am- 10 pm without plugging in with moderate use. Typically about 45 percent at the end of the night.
---this is the best smart phone i have ever used--i don't need a high end device--the screen size is the big draw here---from the reviews i have read--the glossy back and the power button location are the only drawbacks to this phone--but use a case--and put the phone upside down in your back pocket, and you won't turn it on by accident---watch out for car mode-----turn off automatic launch on the app--or it will drain the battery---have fun getting to know this sophisticated and capable smartphone---
I purchased this phone for my son a month ago and I'm so impressed with it that I just ordered one for myself. Love the 5.5" Screen - it's like a mini tablet. Phone calls are clear and the camera takes great pictures.<br/><br/>Both my son and I switched from our Sprint plan to Virgin Mobile in 2013 and have no complaints.  The service is good and I like that there is never overages.  It's affordable --  $55 month for unlimited calls, text and data.  Hotspot with 5GB is additional $15 month.
This phone is definitely worth the cost.  I have only had it for a few days, but it is well made, fast, and everyone who has played with it has been surprised that it is a budget phone.  The camera is great and the battery lasts me two days with normal use.  High usage (audiobooks all day and a few gaming sessions throughout the day) equaled one day of battery.  It has met my expectations completely.  It is a bit large, but as it was so much less than the Samsung S 5 that is completely okay.
I love this phone. I bought it online without ever seeing one in person and I was surprised how large it is. I have no trouble hearing callers, the volume goes up quite loud, and everybody seems to hear me clearly as well. It also connects flawlessly with the Bluetooth in my car. It charges quickly and stays charged for over a day unless I'm using it constantly as I do when I'm reading a book on it. I have my whole music library on it and the speaker sound is also surprisingly good.
Definitely needed a cover, I'd recommend:<br/>Tri-color Double Dip Genuine Hard Plastic Shell Case Cover For HTC Desire 816<br/>^Hard glass screen covers do not fit under this case though, so I wouldn't waste the money on being over-prepared.<br/>Overall, good phone (albeit Huge!). Battery life isn't that great, but it's to be expected with something this size and with so many features running.<br/>Takes great pictures and performs fast with need for minimal re-starts.
This phone is very slim, excellent construction, looks fantastic, and is blazing fast! I downloaded 2GB maps in under two minutes! The resolution is very crisp and is a competitor with the best of the phones out there! Android vs Apple... Aliens vs fruits, erm i think the aliens will win that battle! A fantastic phone for the price; best on the market; there is no other competition for under $200. The speakers are also brilliant; very good and LOUD!
it's about the same size of the iphone 6 Plus<br/>and honestly should have got one from CL<br/>the 13 mega pixel camera sucks pictures come out way to dark and always have to be edited and adjust the contrast and brightness or for some reason open instagram in the app and use that Camera for taking pictures they look more natural and color accurate . The Internet and everything else works ok most of the time and when the youtube vídeos work the sound is crystal clear and good phone call quality
Been on Virgin Mobile prepaid for many years and this is by far the best phone I have ever owned. Some of the features are almost like the I phone with out the big price tag and the high cost monthly service. It's my second HTC phone I have owned and I love the company. It's a well built phone with all the features one needs in a smart phone, The big screen is great, its like the best of a pad and a phone. Clear phone calls and web use is fast.
Needed an upgrade from an HTC 601 Desire. Received an amazing phone have to be honest! To think, it's considered mid-range. C'mon really? 13MP rear-facing camera whilst wielding a front-facing 5MP camera, packing a quad-core processor that's blazing fast with applications, and YOU CAN'T FORGEG ABOUT THAT 5.5" screen display. Really awesome phone, especially coming from a 5MP rear-facing, dual-core, 4.7", puny 601. HTC never dissapoints!
Wow this thing is BIG! I wanted a bigger phone for occasional web surfing and easier texting, and this really fits the bill. The display is crystal clear and the sound is amazingly good. The only complaint I have is that it is very "plastic" feeling. I haven't dropped it yet and I did get a good bumper cover, but I'm not sure it would survive a drop on a hard surface. Only time will tell, but for the price, you can't get much better.
This phone is HUGE !! They are not joking when they say it has a massive screen so if you're looking for a phone that's almost a "phablet" this is perfect . I've had it for only a few days so I don't have much to say except that it has a pretty good battery , excellent response time , and it is absolutely gorgeous ! It's so sleek and pretty , I can't get enough haha if you're thinking about buying it - DO IT ! You won't regret it !!
Great phone!!! The camera quality is amazing! Streaming videos is as well! The only issues I had so far was that, once in a while, the battery drains quicker than I hope, but then again, it's probably just trying to find service. Also, at times, even though I'm on wifi, it seems to struggle loading pages quicker. But I love the phone. You get what you paid for. But I really think anyone who buys this phone got themselves a great deal!
Awesome phone, Great speakers, Huge brilliant screen. Camera is awesome. Looking forward to the Lollipop update. Super impressed with battery life. I really can't say anything bad about this phone. Make sure you shop around, I found this phone on Amazon for less than $200 which is a steal for a phone of this quality. Just an amazing piece of technology! Paired up with a plan from Virgin and you really have a huge bang for the buck.
I ordered this phone based on all the good reviews I had read here. It was a great decision! I love the phone. I was afraid that the screen would be too big, but I was wrong. It's perfect. I installed a 64GB SD card and rooted the phone, so I shouldn't have any storage problems. Screen is fast and responsive, apps launch quickly and switching between apps is fast. Highly recommended to anyone who wants a great phone on a budget.
Fantastic phone! Love all the features it's blazing fast and if anyone complains about the battery life I'm not sure what they are hoping for cause this one is great! From a full charge it easily last the entire day. And that's with me streaming music for a good 6hrs and a fair amount of other usage. Would highly recommend be sure to get a case tho phone feels a bit fragile, and it's size can make it awkward to hAndle at 1st.
Coming from a htc evo 3d on virgins service this phone is a huge improvement much faster better camera large screen almost too big 8 gigs of internal storage you get about 4 gigs of it to use for apps you can move apps to your sd card if you have one I'd suggest at least a 32 gig one I'd also suggest getting a phone case for this phone it's an all plastic build so it's probably not very rugged so drop protection is a must
I just recently purchased the HTC Desire 816. Man! This phone is awesome!!! To me it is just as fast as the iphone 6 plus. There is no lag time. And the boom sound beats any other sound from a cell phone and the includes the iphone 6 plus. I am happy that I purchsed this phone. And for the price, you can't ask for a better phone. The htc desire 816 is just as good a phone as any hi end phone out there on the market!!!!!!
Best phone ive owned. And I get a lot of complements. The size is perfect once I got used to it. There are times I catch myself using this rather than my 10" tablet since the phone is so big and the resolution is so great. But this phone does need more space. 8gb is not enough specially since they use up 4 for their stuff, so really you only have 4gb to use. So I use my tablet for all other stuff I need.
For me and my use of it, this HTC Desire 816 has been just fine.  Battery life is much, much better than the previous HTC phone I had...which almost stopped me from buying this one...but the price was good, and I saw it at the AT&T; store for more than $100 more, so, I decided to purchase and I've been totally happy.  All the features I need in a smart phone...no complaints after almost a year of ownership.
I am absolutely in love with this phone and it's features!!
It's a great phone for the price. The size is a bit of an adjustment but overall. Very good. Battery life is one of the best I had. The connectivity to WiFi goes in and out but it's tolerable. Since this is not a top tier phone,  finding good cases is a good challenge if you're in to that type of thing. Get a good case as soon as you get the phone. The screen breaks easily.  I enjoy this phone.
So far love the phone. shipping actually came a day early. ill probably end up doing a full out review on the phone. cuz honestly i was alil hesitant about it, im coming from the sg3 so. but over all bad ass phone takes great picks an videos, enjoy the larger screen. takes alil to get use to holding it but, i dig it, for the price its great. and front facing speakers are actually not to shabby.
This is a great smartphone for the price. It has the qualities of a nice smartphone without being too busy and overdone and it's a good price range. It's nice and.fast, compatible with great apps I use, very durable and a nice feel to it. I recommend anyone who is looking for a decent smartphone for a cheap price to simply invest a couple hundred bucks into this phone...It's amazing
I'm pretty much in love with this phone. I thought I wouldn't get used to the size of the phone but it only took a day or two to get used to it. The camera quality is fantastic for the front and the back cameras. I went from a galaxy s3 and I honestly think this phone is faster and more dependable. Definitely a good phone for a good price. The battery life is also AMAZING
Received my HTC desire 816 today and I'm absolutely in love. Even my friend who has a iPhone 6 plus complimented on how nice the phone looks. I really wanted a iPhone but had to settle for something affordable and honestly this phone quality doesn't make me care that it's not an iPhone or that I only payed 149 dollars. Arrived the day it was suppose to. Great camera btw!
I already owned this phone and ordered one for my girlfriend. It arrived well packaged and everything worked. No scratches or anything. I enjoy this phone very much as well as my girlfriend does. It has a lot of quality features like the bigger brands such as Apple and others just for a cheaper prise. It's performance is great. There's just nothing to complain about.
At first I had a lot of doubt about buying this phone and the only reason it attracted me was the screen size and of course the price. I have to say after a while of owning and operating this phone daily, this is a great phone. The thing that has surprised me most about this phone is its battery life given that it has a big screen and great sounding speakers.
This phone is amazing in every way!! I love the camer, screen, price, and sound!! The one thing i live the most from this phone is the slow motion camera!!!! I wanted to get the iphone 6 plus just because of the slow motion but when i found out this phone has it i just had to have it!! All in all the htc 816 is super amazing! 100/110 recomend this phone!!
The only reason why I gave it a four is because when I first got it there was a huge problem with the screen lighting up. The phone was response to touch I just could not see anything. But the problem. Fixed itself as a I was packing it to be sent back and has not happened again. Other than that hiccup I have been loving this phone
I got this as a present for my daughter for Christmas.  She was so excited when she opened it up!  The phone has worked so well and we have had know problems with it whatsoever, she has even dropped the phone a few times and I am happy to report that it has not cracked due to the special screen HTC uses.  Great product!
720p is good enough, boomsound is loud, battery is good, camera is fantastic, its got enough ram and cpu power. this is hands down the best 'no-contract' phone for sale on amazon. you can always go the unlocked phone route if you're going prepaid, but you're not going to find anything comparable to this for the price.
Just got this phone yesterday and I already love  it. Great phone for a great price. Does everything a $600 phone does plus some. Looks great. Nice HD quality. The feel is amazing. Works great. Everything accurate in description. If you're looking for a big phone for a low price, I highly reccomend the HTC Desire 816.
Fantastic phone. You will not be disappointed.
***UPGRADED TO 5.0.2 on 4/24/15*****This was a gift, an upgrade from the VM F3. I love the phone also and I'm comparing it to my S5.  I also purchased the OPTIONZ PREMIUM TEMPERED GLASS for it which fits perfectly and was so easy to install. I absolutely think if you want a great android phone from VM then the Desire 816 or the S5 are the way to go!!! The gift is a hit!!  She absolutely loves the screen size, the speed is on par with $500+ phones and I don't know what all the bad battery talk is about but this phone was taken off the charger around 8am fully charged and has just gone below 70% after midnight.  Apps most used were text, FB, mail, and browser...  There are no complaints about this phone (none)!!!**********7/1/15 UPDATE******** Bought another for sons birthday replacing a S3 with a cracked screen, he never wanted such a big phone but is now used to it and both phones are working great on LOLLIPOP, sound is loud with both speakers, camera's are just as good as phones coming out today, tempered glass protects screen and you can't beat VM UNLIMITED at $45 even though dAta gets throttled after 1GB....Best phone with a VIRGIN MOBILE SIM
Huge upgrade from my Galaxy SII. I wanted a smart phone with a large screen, that wasn't outrageously expensive. (Avoiding iPhone's and Galaxy's).<br/><br/>I'm not someone who knows a lot about technology. It does everything I need it to and does it well. Beautiful, easy to use, face, great camera. Love it.
Honestly I ordered this as used and it came looking brand new no blemishes despite the box being wrecked. This phone is fast and I'm a power user. Can play games with ease. Snapdragon 400 processor means almost zero lag and for anyone upgrading it comes with solid battery battery life easily lasts me all day
PROS:<br/>-Great sounding speakers<br/>-Decent 720p HD screen<br/>-Smooth overall performance<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>-Buttons a stretch to reach<br/>-Camera slow to focus in low-light<br/>-Lacks a standout feature<br/><br/>There's a better one in this price bracket though: http://amzn.to/1JhwHjf
I love this phone. It will give any of the more expensive phones a run for their money. This is my second HTC phone and I must say they are doing something right. I would never stand in line for an Iphone and the galaxy when this phone is just as great if not better! save your money buy this phone!!!!
This phone is great, one of the best I have ever owned. I would suggest that you get a case for is right away, as-is the lens covering over the back camera can scratch/scuff easily when placed on a hard surface such as a table or desk. Other than that, I would rate this is a really great phone!
Great phone, I LOVE nearly everything about it. Before I made the purchase I did a lot of research on it. Everything I expected and more is what I got. Love it overall. One issue is I dropped it not even three feet and the screen shattered...words of advice buy a Case or back up screen.
I love my new HTC Desire. The pictures are better than expected. The price was great and takes the same pictures as the Samsung S4 or Note 3 for 1/3 the price. The battery life is not the greatest that's why 4 out 5. But I have a spare. I think it is an awesome phone for a great price!
This phone is surprisingly good, and for the price is a steal. Is way better than the other phones that are more expensive because of the brand name. I really love my HTC. Is easy to use, clear and a great resolution of the pictures. I definitely recommend this phone to everyone!
Great price on a decent phone.  The phone is fast and light, a little bigger than I thought.  Has nice sound and is well engineered as far as the layout of hardware and functionality.  Not to hip on all the software that is preloaded on the device, which is my only complaint.
HTC Desire is a great phone. I don't think there was anything wrong with it besides you can't have two windows open which they say and the call quality is really bad some places and my calls drop but 85 percent of the time I don't have problems with call quality or reception.
Got this as a Christmas present for my husband and he loves it! Going to get one for myself soon as well. The screen is HUGE compared to my current HTC Evo. The way you interact with it is different as well, but it is fairly intuitive, and it didn't take him long to adjust.
Was a gift for my mom. She loves it. It has everything you will need. It is very light weight. I bought case for it because it feels as though if I drop it once it will break. Great phone. I have an iPhone. I almost contemplated switching to this phone I like it so much.
Solid mid-tier smartphone. Feels nice in the hand, screen looks good. Happy with the performance so far, doesn't handle "heavy" multi-tasking very well. Stock performance suffers greatly from carrier bloat ware. (Bringing it down to a 3.5 or even 3 star phone)
When I broke my HTC desire 5(?)16 on vacation I found that upgrading to the 816 was the same price so decided to go for it.  The phone is enormous and though I was worried at first, now I can't imagine going back.  Very fast also, gorgeous display, highly recommended.
Best phone offered by virgin mobile in my opinion. This phone is BIG so keep that in mind before ordering. 5.5" screen, great cam and processor. There's no reason to buy an iPhone unless you want to pay five times more for an Apple on the back of your inferior phone. ;)
Big improvement after Kyocera Vibe blew speaker .The boom sound is great for phone & video.HTC guide made it easy to transfer content phone to phone quickly,besides setting up & answers for all functions,screen color awesome so far I'm very happy with purchase
Now when I got this phone I was like wow, this thing is huge! (That's what she said) 5.5" screen and it's a phablet. I went to an iPhone 5 to this and it's not bad. Battery life isn't that bad varys per person. But overall, big screen, has nfc and lte.
My wife and I are both very happy with these phones. The specs and features for the price are top notch! They take fantastic pictures, are very fast, and have a huge battery. I had to charge my old phone every six hours, this phone goes more than two days.
**Firstly, this is the only choice you have for high specs and low price on virgin mobile. So there really is no reason to not get it.**<br/><br/>Alright now that you accepted that fact lets state the flaws you wont notice right away and what makes me give this 3 stars after over a year of owning it. Keep in mind I have large hands (im 6'4'') so youd think i would like a bigger phone, right? Wrong.<br/><br/>1. The actual screen to body ratio is pretty poor. Theres a large border around the screen, the speakers take up a lot of space, the stupid logo has its own row, and the navigation buttons are on screen which doesnt count as usable space. The screen seems MUCH smaller after realizing what you have to actually work with.<br/><br/>2. I didnt think it would be a problem with the power button being above the volume buttons but i absolutely hate this. I mean HATE. Im not left handed so turning the screen on and off requires finesse with your pointer finger to not lose grip of the phone and throw it. Ive done this a lot and like i said before, i have large hands so i cant imagine an average sized person doing this without always using both hands to hold the phone and push the button. this sort of required finesse also applies to typing text with 1 hand, it wont happen.<br/><br/>3. Camera is very poor and grainy in low light. Otherwise it is pretty standard.<br/><br/>4. I previously owned a Samsung Galaxy S3 (also virgin mobile) and will say the colors on that phone blow this phone away. it was pretty underwhelming looking at this phone until i finally forgot what the s3 looked like.<br/><br/>5. 8 gb internal storage with unremovable bloatware means hardly any real world storage space. After system updates, HTC sense junk updates, you will be scouring your phone for things to delete just so you can install the next major system update. My galaxy s3 had 16gb...how is this newer phone half the space?<br/><br/>6. A general wrap-up on the size of the phone. Since the screen is 5.5 in, with a large bezel surrounding it the phone is much larger than youd think. i constantly drop or throw (like a bar of soap) this phone because it isnt practical to hold with 1 hand. Im sorry, im getting older and i feel dumb standing in 1 spot with both hands on the phone for everything i do like im in the 3rd grade staring at the davinci code trying to figure out a great mystery. This phone is just too damn large for how much usable screen space there is. Also, having this in my jeans pocket is very uncomfortable and i always take it out if i go out to eat.<br/><br/>7. This is the biggest issue. The simm card slot on these phones is very poorly manufactured. After a few times of dropping the phone, the spring mechanism that "snaps" and holds your simm card in place will break. This causes the simm card to never be able to properly stay in the slot. bought a hard plastic slim case that sort of smashes the sim card into the slot and keeps it in place. So now i can never remove this crappy plastic case or else the simm card shoots out of my phone. This issue is well known if you look it up. I was going to repair it myself but the simm card assembly is contact soldered to the main board which requires a special heatgun. If you get any parts too hot your phone is perma fried. So now sometimes my internet just drops out and says "cannot establish a wireless connection" and i have to hold the upper right corner of the phone where the simm slot is to regain connection.<br/><br/>7-2. So because the phone is too large, you drop it, simm card slot breaks. There is no amount of being careful in the world where you WONT drop your phone. it is inevitable.<br/><br/>8. With the latest system software updates the phone now randomly has a restart loop (seems completely random but it happens on google maps a lot) and will lock up on the HTC logo screen. Unless you wait for your battery to die the only way to regain control of the phone is to rip the back of the "non removable" backing off. Then, with a tiny flat head screwdriver pry UP on the battery cables/pin that connect the battery to the power board. Push the connector back into the pins, and snap the backing plate back on. Power on phone. This problem actually happens a lot and is very random as to what causes it.<br/><br/>9. Turn off location services unless you like a lot of errors popping up saying "google everything has stopped working" Turn on location services when you want to use GPS.<br/><br/>That is the end of the review. I hope this helps with some people who do not want those "star struck reviews". This is a real world, normal person with a job account of the problems ive found over the last year+ with the phone.
I like this phone a lot, it's great for gaming, Youtube, web browsing and news feeds. Call quality is decent, haven't had any real issues with slowdown or restarts or app crashes (unless it was the app at fault). I like HTC's more conservative approach to pack in bloatware, this is a huge improvement over the sack of garbage Samsung phone I got last year and got rid of as soon as possible. Virgin Mobile's bloatware is another story, but removing the Mobile ID .apk from the phone's base directory stopped Virgin from killing off my wallpaper and shortcuts every time the phone restarted.<br/><br/>Now the main issue I have with this phone: the headphone jack has become increasingly loose to where my headphone plug now slides out of the jack with very little pull - it frequently unplugs itself whenever I put my phone into my pocket. This is bad, because I need to listen to music while on public transit in order to preserve my sanity. And not dealing with a janky headphone jack is also beneficial to my sanity.<br/><br/>I called HTC support and got someone who was almost impossible to understand, eventually I got to the point where I asked them what the outcome will be if I send my phone in and wait over a week for them to do anything with it. They said that if the problem was the result of anything that wasn't a factory defect (ambiguous; they could easily claim that it's the customer's fault for plugging in headphones and I couldn't disprove that, even though this headphone jack is objectively a POS because I've never had a smartphone jack go out on me like this) then it would cost me nearly $200. Yeah... For that much I could buy another brand new HTC Desire 816 and have enough leftover to order myself a pizza. Are you for real, HTC? You think anyone believes that fixing a headphone jack costs THAT much in parts & labor? That's gouging a paying customer, plain and simple.<br/><br/>I was loving this phone with zero reservations before, but now I have quite a few of them, especially since I just had to drop a lot of money on bluetooth headphones to make up for this audio jack fiasco.
I had the HTC One V for a while and traded it in because I wanted a larger phone. But I loved that HTC phone and was always looking for one to go back to. After using the Virgin Mobile Supreme/ZTE Supreme for a long while I found myself without a tablet (my tablet all of a sudden stopped working). I decided to consolidate technology by getting a larger phone to take over tablet duties and happened to see the HTC Desire 816. I wanted to get it for a specific price and Amazon had it so here we are.<br/><br/>I have to say that this phone is the best phone I have had so far. So far I haven't felt need to replace my tablet. The screen size is really good (5.5 inches is substantial without being too crazy...even though if it were a little bigger I wouldn't complain) and it helps that it is a really light weight phone. Editing documents is a snap (running Office Mobile). I use it to take notes in church as well as in meetings at work and it works great.  The camera takes amazing pictures and video which I can upload in a snap with the 4G LTE. The sound system is off the charts and the speed is great. I have added a 32GB micro SD but you can add up to 128GB.<br/><br/>I was surprised how light it was when I received it...you definitely need a case so that it will not get broken. Make sure you buy a silicone one with a hard case attachment.  I have dropped it a few times and have not had any problems.<br/><br/>The only change I would ask for is it HTC would make the screen a little bigger (maybe 5.8 - just because I use it for so much more than just a phone). I also would add more internal memory. 8GB is good (I'm not a gamer so it doesn't bother me but it might bother others) but 16GB would be much better.<br/><br/>I have had this phone since November/December and I can rightly say I am well pleased! This one hit all the right buttons with me.
Its screen isn't as fine-grained as the one on an iPhone 6+. But it's plenty good enough. I mean, these big phones have 5.5" (diagonal) screens, and the HTC has as many pixels as my 42" HDTV. That's more than enough for me. The HTC also has the best sound I've heard yet on a smarty phone. It has become the stereo for my recumbent trike -- along with its dashboard in general with an excellent app called the Ulysse Speedometer.<br/><br/>I've been happy with Virgin Mobile for some years now. This phone is the best one I've ever had on their system (or on Verizon before I got smart and ditched them). The battery supposedly can't be replaced, but I suspect something can be done about that when the time comes. There are also the "charger" batteries you can get that hang on the back of your phone. I have a couple of them around. The iPhone shares this problem -- at three time the HTC Desire's price. Amusing.<br/><br/>So I have a  13 MP camera (5 MP selfie cam) and a generally cool device that's large enough that I no longer use my 7" tablet, but small enough to fit in my front pants pocket. To make my phone more able to stand up to life's slings and arrows (and droppages) I got a Nillkin Frosted Shield Matte Hard Back Case Cover - fits perfectly. Also, instead of the crummy, ultra thin screen protectors that inevitably bubble, I blew the Big Bucks (under $9; free shipping with Prime) for an  Optionz Premium Tempered Glass Screen Protector for HTC Desire 816. Hah! Feels like Gorilla Glass. We're talking serious protection here!<br/><br/>I agonized over this phone purchase decision for several weeks. Even with Amazon's low price (lower than Virgin's) this was a bunch of money to spend -- at least for an old guy (like me) in a Florida "55+" trailer park. But hah! Loudest smart phone around. Play Pandora and run the bike computer at the same time -- which this phone can totally do with no lag because its CPU and RAM are up to snuff -- and life is good.<br/><br/>One note, applies to most Android phones: Too much pre-installed crap-apps bog the thing down and suck battery. Eventually I'll need to root it to get rid of the cruft. Not knocking HTC here; most computing devices these days come with a lot of junk software pre-installed. And Facebook is the worst one. It's the most power-wasting app on my phone. It has GOT to go!  (I can still access FB through the Chrome browser, so no loss except a power drain.)<br/><br/>FREE TIP: If you're on Virgin -- and for all I know, other cell providers also do this -- you can keep a spare phone around, and if your "main" phone needs repair, gets stolen or is otherwise out of action you can activate the spare one in a couple of minutes through Virgin's website. So my previous phone, a perfectly good (but slightly small for me) Samsung Galaxy Victory is now in a cubby on my office wall, ready to hit the field and substitute at loose end, 1/3 back or any other position I designate. Fore!
It's a great phone but has its good and bad days, the screen is just beautiful to me, definitely a hd display. The battery life isn't bad but it's not that good either, I find it actually having better battery life with power saver off then with it being on. And internal memory Is kinda disappointing because I constantly have to delete stuff to get other stuff in. But other then that it's a great phone I can honestly say I love it. The BoomSound speakers are freaking awesome, sound is loud and clear and just perfect. It's also quite fast, it has a snapdragon 410 chipset with adreno 306 graphics with that it clocks at 1.6 ghz with 1.5 GB of ram to support. And let me tell ya it helps so much. Now back to the battery, please do not expect this phone with 5.5 in 720x1280 (~267 ppi)  screen  to have awesome battery life with a 2600 mah lithium polymer battery to have as good battery as lets say the iPhone 6+ please note that the 6+ has a 2915 mah lithium ion battery and that's with the screen at only 50% brightness on standby. Ok so just like the 6+ heavy usage isn't really this things forte. Now the camera, it's not a photo lovers dream but it's not exactly a nightmare either, with the right lighting and the proper settings you can take really good pictures. But please note that it's not solely the megapixels that make the camera good it's the sensor, so this camera has a good sensor with the pixel density to back it up. So 13mp is nice but crappy sensor crappy photos. Same goes with the front that has 5mp. Both can shoot in 1080p ok but it can be iffy. But as a whole this is a really good phone. Definitely keeping it until it dies or until I can afford a new one, and even then I'd still keep it because I really love it 😂
I don't recommend this phone. There are so many preinstalled apps that can't be removed that there isn't room to add any apps that I actually want. Adding an sd card has little impact on this issue because many apps can't be moved to the sd card.
Very pleased with this phone so far.  I was a little nervous ordering an HTC, as my previous HTC phone was so-so, but this one is fast, has a nice big screen (size-wise, same dimensions as the iPhone 6 Plus), good built-in features (the standard music player actually lets me edit playlists in an intelligent way that EVERY music player should but almost none do), and despite what I've read in other reviews, the camera seems fine and the battery life is excellent.  I'm sure the top-end Samsung Galaxy and iPhone competitors are better in many respects, but for $200, and a $35/month unlimited everything plan, I am completely satisfied.  My only wish is that it came with 16 GB internal memory instead of 8, but 8 is still an improvement over all my previous phones, so I can live with it.<br/><br/>Adding June 2015: Again I am still pleased with this phone in most ways, but I have to add a caveat: the 8 GB internal memory is getting to be very limiting.  I did a factory reset on my phone, let the OS and all the pre-installed apps update (we do have Android 5.02 now), and when it was done, they took up over 6 GB.  That doesn't leave a whole lot of room for other apps.  HTC has added to the load of bloatware with many apps which I don't need, are redundant, or where I prefer another app for the purpose.  Google also installs its full suite of apps, many of which I don't use.  And of course you can't remove any of these or move them to the sdCard.  I'm still not sorry I bought the phone, but I can't really recommend it to new purchasers at this point; the way things are going you won't have *any* room for personal apps before long.  (Virgin has also apparently announced they are not going to upgrade it to the next version of Android, and has stopped carrying the phone on their site -- there are rumors that they are going to sell out to someone else soon, so you might want to hold off on purchasing or upgrading any Virgin phone till things are more definite.)
The phone itself is great BUT my phone seems to have a completely dead pixel on the bottom right. It was there right when I first turned the phone on. It's a black pixel and it's just so distracting and makes me like the phone less. I try to ignore it but since I know it's there I just keep staring at it. I love this phone though. I would gladly give this phone 5 stars if I'm able to get a replacement phone.<br/><br/>October 25<br/>I got a refund and now I've reordered the phone. I hope that there is nothing wrong with this one. I really do love this phone but the dead pixel on ny first one was just so distracting. I'll update my review and rating (currently 2 stars) once I get the phone.<br/><br/>October 27<br/>I got my new phone. It works perfectly fine. No dead pixels! This phone is just awesome.<br/><br/>Now that I have a perfectly working phone I'll give my review.<br/><br/>This phone is great for a mid-range smart phone. It does pretty much everything that a higher tech smart phone does. My friend has the Galaxy Mega and she has been playing with my phone a lot.<br/><br/>I absolutely love the boom sound speakers. No more cupping my hand behind my phone on full volume just to try to hear a video. This phone pretty much has a mini surround sound.<br/><br/>The cameras are really good. 13 mega pixel back camera and 5 mega pixel in the front. Yay for great selfies!<br/><br/>This phone is user friendly...to me anyways. I've never had an HTC phone before and everything was easy to find and modify.<br/><br/>If you want a big phone that is cheap (money wise) then this is the phone for you. I went from a 4 inch screen to this 5.5 inch screen and now my old phone looks super tiny. This phone never felt awkward to me though. I adjusted to it really fast.<br/><br/>So far for me the battery had been really good. I took it to work at 5 am fully charged and with texting, phone calls, internet use I get home just after 6 pm and the battery was around 50%. Not bad. I do keep the screen dark most of the time though. My eyes work better with the darker screen.<br/><br/>There are only a couple of things that I don't like about this phone.<br/>1) The amount of space this phone is very small. Only 8 gigs. Buy a micro sd card or use the one you have. I personally bought a 32 gig micro sd card for this phone.<br/>2) This phone is very lightweight and slick (due to the plastic back...also that is a finger print magnent). Buy a case if you can find one. They are very hard to find but they are there. I have a red one on mine.<br/><br/>All in all this is a great phone...phablet...no regrets even though I did have to return the first phone due to a very distracting dead pixel that wasn't able to be fixed. So just beware when you buy an electronic device off the internet.
I love the phone – best I have ever had.<br/><br/>The phone works, as it should.  No dropped calls in the first month.  Voicemail is much louder on the better speakers, and when I turn the phone speaker on, I can hear the phone from across the room.<br/><br/>There is plenty of storage for my apps.  One of the reasons I upgraded from my HTC Evo 4G was that I had to delete an app so that I could get its latest update.  Not a problem with the HTC 816.  The SanDisk Memory Zone app tells me that the internal memory has 4.2 GB truly available for storage – I’ve loaded all the apps I wanted, and including the ones that cannot be moved to the SD card, I still have 1.5 GB free of internal storage – plus 29 GB free on the 32 GB memory card.<br/><br/>The battery life is much better for me than was the Evo.  I charge this phone every three days: The Evo needed it at least daily.  I use this for navigation, using GPS and Waze.  Works well and is easy to see.  I listen to Podcasts and read books via the Kindle app.  Web surfing via Google and Chrome work fast.  I’ve watched a couple of Netflix movies while waiting for my vehicles to be serviced.  Good picture, sound – no “buffering” that I remember.  Audible works fine, as does TuneIn Radio.<br/><br/>The camera is good enough for me: I can easily “share” the videos or pics I take to Google Drive, among other places.<br/><br/>The setup was quick – all my apps came over from my Evo and I did not do anything to make that happened!  I had to sign in with my Gmail account and everything worked!<br/><br/>I like the size, I like the phone, I like that this is about $600 LESS than the same equipped iPhone 6 plus.  Highly recommended!<br/><br/>Update:  After one year's use, I still love it.  File Manager app makes it easy to delete junk that accumulates on the phone - the SD Card is great for moving apps.  HTC or VirginMobile or somebody upgraded this to Lollipop 5.0.2 - It is still the best phone available for VM at less than $200.
This is an awesome phone. No two ways about it - the very best mid-range phone you can hope to drop your hard earned cash on.  Very good screen, great battery life, decent camera, awesome sound, highly responsive, sufficient memory [tho barely], decent performance.  It's a nicely assembled package, and delivers.  This is amazing value for money.<br/><br/>So, why the bad score?  Simple: HTC and Virgin Mobile have installed some nasty applications: without so much as a by your leave, they have permanently running applications that have full access to all your data [spyware!], can be updated without your permission, and update your home screen.  My background and icons have been reset so often I have lost count.  Virgin regularly adds advertising to my 'status bar' without a means to turn it off [it does not respect the 'show notifications' flag].<br/><br/>I contacted Virgin Mobile about disabling "Mobile ID" and "My Account" [Case #56224637] - they were very polite, but basically informed me it is not possible to disable, let alone uninstall.  Helpfully, when it first starts, it asserts that installing the applications constitutes acceptance of the terms and conditions and the privacy policy -- even though there is no choice on installing. The privacy policy makes for an interesting read.<br/><br/>I contacted HTC about disabling the "BlinkFeed" feature [T#11446100777]. They, too, politely informed me that it isn't possible to disable, let alone uninstall... and if it is a problem for me, it is resolved by never connecting to WiFi or mobile data.<br/><br/>In summary, this is an excellent phone, crippled by Virgin Mobile & HTC's spyware that has egregious permissions and privacy violations. Once rooted, it is a five star phone, native, one star - this review reflects the average...
What can I say, for the price, this phone is remarkable. The screen is beautiful, the BoomSound is superb, and the processor is blazing fast! Best virgin mobile phone out there, and for the price, nothing compares. Highly recommend!
Got for my wife;  she loves it...so far so good after one month.<br/>Of course, she used to have a $4.95 flip phone<br/>so of course she loves it;  I still have my $5 flip  phone<br/>to call her so you tell me who's the idiot.
Got my phone on the last estimated day. Perfect condition. Have had it for over a month and ZERO complains. The battery does die quickly if you play candy crush a lot or use Snapchat a lot but, you can always get a power bank.
OMG best phone ever!! I left boost mobile using the Kg optimus f7. This camera is awsome!!  Much cheaper on Amazon!  Saved $100.00 ordering from them. I would recommend this phone to anyone who loves playing on there phone.
Excellent phone, I'm in love with it but the battery drainage is kind of tough to handle. I charge it about 2 times more during the day than my old phone. Probably because I'm on this phone all day. But I love this device.
Works excellent doesn't feel cheap or like it will brake in a week. It's is a big phone at 5.5 but it is also very thin about the size of an iPhone 6. The camera is also very good. Easily competes with $600 phones.
Received my beautiful htc 816 about 3 weeks ago..since i still had time and money on my account i opted to wait for the start of the month to activate my phone..at my unboxing i connected to wifi and completed my setup...got a htc firmware update right away..when phone rebooted i just couldnt believe it..a sleek and streamlined vanilla android kit kat just like my nexus 10 with almost 5gb for apps..the touch screen was awesome and apps played smoothly..i thought finally this is going to be a great experience...FF to today...activation process has been a nightmare..after hours on phone assuring me all is well...nothing!!..finally my talk and text started working but no data..the rep was telling me no data where i was..but i used data on my last VM phone for the last 5 years with 3g speeds..will be heading to work soon today and i hope they got my data is working...Now for the heartbreak!!!!...when i connected my phone to wifi this morning..something strange happened..my phone rebooted 3 times..wasnt sure what was going on..Then.........all my apps dissappeared and were replaced with the VM rom..full of apps and wallpaers that i cant remove or will ever use..my storage went from almost 5gb down to 2.8 because of all this bloatware..For a second i thought VM has finally joined the big boys..but alas no..this completely  screwed up my phone and at this moment i still do not have data..will updated my experience later...the phone is awesome in its original state!!
I revised my review down from *** to ** after using it for a few weeks.<br/><br/>The good: a nice big screen--and that's pretty much it.  This phone does run Android Lollipop pretty smoothly, for whatever that's worth.  I have not been impressed at all with the speakers even though they are supposed to be one of the phone's best features.  Battery life is good if you use an app like Juice Defender but not so great out of the box.<br/><br/>The bad: the low internal memory is a serious issue.  There is so much crapware installed on this phone that you cannot get rid of unless you root that you will be lucky to put 20 apps on this thing before you start getting error messages from the Play Store because it no longer has enough memory to auto-update your apps--including all that crapware.  Yes, you can add a large external Micro-SD card and move some apps to it but that isn't a real solution.  Why?  Well, 95% of apps can't be moved to it--mostly just games and some third party apps and when they get updated by Google Play they end up on the internal memory card again.  Many apps also use memory from the internal card even if you run them from the external SD.  I've got probably less than 30% of the apps on this thing that I had on my previous phone, a Galaxy S3.  Many apps I paid for I cannot put on this phone because you are forced to prioritize brutally when there is so little internal memory.<br/><br/>Then there are the updates.  By my count there have been at least 4 updates between Android and HTC that forced my phone to reboot in the past 10 days, and I have no control over when they go through.  The other day I was driving to an appointment using my Waze GPS when the screen went black.  I thought the phone crashed, but then came the familiar Android is updating message and when my phone booted back up Waze GPS was no longer functional--the map was blank and it had no idea where I was.  I switched to Co-Pilot GPS which stores maps on the device--and my map was gone and the app was acting like I was a new customer who had just installed for the first time.  And this is all happening WHILE I AM DRIVING AND WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF USING THE GPS TO GET TO AN APPOINTMENT!!!!!!<br/><br/>Maybe I was spoiled by the Galaxy but to me this is a seriously lousy phone, which was likely the reason Virgin Mobile stopped selling it after less than a year.  If I had the money I would replace this thing tomorrow.
I've had this phone for about 4 days and I love it! I had a LG Optimus F3 that was also prepaid virgin mobile but I was looking mainly for a bigger screen. This phone does not disappoint!<br/>The Boom sound is great, it gets about as loud as my Macbook.<br/>OS is easy to use.<br/>You can still see the screen in the sunlight. (A problem I had with my LG)<br/>Apps load fast, isn't any noticeable delay.<br/><br/>DRAWBACKS<br/>Have to charge the battery after about a day and half. (If I don't really use it.) I try to keep it on power save mode.<br/>Plastic on the back is prone to fingerprints.<br/>8GB of storage isn't a lot after all the downloads already preloaded it leaves you with about 4GB. I bought a 32 GB Sandisk SD card for about $12.00 off amazon and the phone has no problem with it.<br/><br/>Note: Make sure you wait till Virgin Mobile already downloads "Virgin Mobile Essentials" onto it before you do anything. As soon as I got it I fixed it how I wanted and restarted it and it downloaded a whole new layout. So I had to go back and download my apps and "customize" all over again. Isn't not permanent, you can fix it. Its just a hassle to do it all over again. Essentials didn't download until about a few ours after I activated it, so maybe wait a little while and restart before you fix it how you want.<br/>Overall anything I found  slightly wrong with it, doesn't really bother me. More pros than cons. It's a great buy!
I got two of these phones. One for my self and one for my boyfriend they have preformed well defiantly up to standards.  Only thing I could want more is for it to turn on my tv since my dog ate the remote .
Before I bought the HTC Desire, I carefully looked at a lot reviews of what people thought who already had the phone. I was extremely surprised that when I got mine, the reviews held up to their own. I LOVE this phone!!! The display could be a little bit cleaner, but I don't really notice it unless I am staring at it for a long time. The fact that it's so big is perfect for me because I have huge hands. So many were complaining about the power button being on the left side. I don't understand why so many are complaining about this, because it doesn't bother me at all.<br/><br/>I went from a Samsung Galaxy S3, and I wanted to bring to Virgin Mobile, but Virgin Mobile only accepts Virgin Mobile phones. I was sad at first, but this phone quickly made me forget how much I loved the S3. The most I have heard about this phone is the buttons being on the left side, but again, I do not mind it at all, and maybe those are the people who have small hands, then maybe I could see it being an issue....(to each their own). I love the BOOMSOUND, that the phone has, and the speakers are on the front side. I bought a really nice case for it, and I love it as well too. The battery life on this thing lasts a very long time, and it makes me happy!!! My S3 would lose complete battery life, even with the lowest settings and limits made possible, within about 16 hours.<br/><br/>I would not trade this phone for anything, it's definitely a keeper!!!
Amazing phone upgrade from LG optimus f3...better picture better video faster..all around a great phone....could have had gorrila glass screen....but hey with all the greatness this phone has  Who cares
I love this phone I was coming from the Samsung galaxy ring and this phone is the best upgrade ever. I had it for three days now still learning how to work it but this phone is a great purchase for me.
This is a amazing phone. The best virgin no Ile phone I ever had. Screen size is great. Camera is perfect, hundreds of emojis, internet speed is fast. Texting is a breeze. This phone was a GREAT buy.
This phone is amazing! It's faster than the I phone 6 and 6 plus. It has more processing power and proccerors for that matter than the i phone 6 and 6 plus. This phone is just amazing overall!
Beautiful display, snappy swipping, booming speakers, crisp and detailed camera, and crazy long battery life make this phone a joy to use every day. Definitely a flagship among no contract phones
Excellent  for a great price! You cannot go wrong with this phone has a great screen , awesome speakers, and camera is amazing. I've had this phone for almost a month and I had  no problems yet.
It's a very good phone,<br/>The only problem is that the 8 gigs of phone storage... Half of that is being used for useless apps you will never use and you can't uninstall even if you want to.
I love my new HTC a big improvement from my last phone I love everything even the size it bothered me at first but now I'm use to it and I love it especially eating movies or playing games
It works fine and I like it. I just didn't like that it said about 95% of my memory was full even though I moved most of my apps to the memory card and I don't even have unnecessary apps.
Such a great phone for the price point. I am really glad I found one for sale - they are getting hard to come by. Beautiful screen, great features and call quality. Very happy with it.
My wife and son love their new HTC Phones. I love the great plans I have with Virgin Mobile to meet their phone and data needs. Phone has great screen and sound for a mid priced phone.
Amazing phone, battery last a couple hours less than expected but always getting compliments, amazing sound, excellent memory for price, and would recommend to anyone on Virgin Mobile.
I upgraded from a ZTE Awe and essentially this is better in every way, You can't simply do a phone swap through the Virgin Mobile website if you have an existing account, i tried that and it required me to repay my monthly charge, even though i paid my monthly charge 3 days before receiving this phone on the mail, i didn't repay the charge and called customer service instead and they walked me through the process.<br/><br/> I have proceeded to root the phone, which was easier than the ZTE Awe, and tried a few cyanogenmod nightly builds, but i lost 3g service so i reverted back to the original rom. Something that bothers me is that the second sim slot is blocked off with a rubber filling that i cant remove, i am hoping to sim unlock this device the following month for a lengthy trip to the Dominican Republic and use a CDMA network there, knowing VM's policy i will try to use a third party.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the phone, its all good enough for me, the battery lasts long if you disable NFC, and run it in power saver mode, however i have gone further and added modifications by installing Xposed Framework running greenify and other modules that expand battery beyond that. I like how there is some development support for this device, because i like to tweak my phone a lot.
I've had my phone for about 1 month.  I purchased the phone, because my LG Slider (Keyboard Slide-out) had an internal storage of approximately 500 mb.  I could no longer update any of my apps or system configurations!  With this HTC, I actually read the 200 +page manual.  The phone has many capabilities that I'm exploring on a daily basis.  The ONLY complaint I have, is, unlike my old LG, the HTC does not have an onscreen or on-window menu.  So, sometimes I have to return to a previous screen/window in order to figure out what I need to do to operate the current window/screen/app.  For those of you looking for a BIG phone, be aware.  This phone is no wider than a SAMSUNG or LG.  However, it is about 1.5 to 2 inches longer.  The SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE(S) and the I-phone 6 are larger, but cost a WHOLE lot more than the HTC.  For those of you who are new to smartphones:  Although GOOGLE, the phone manufacturer and the phone carrier may ask permission to track your phone usage and location, ALL apps that you use, do this AUTOMATICALLY!  Last bit of advice.  Buy a screen protector, preferably glass instead of film and a rubberized protection case.  This will be a lot cheaper than the monthly replacement insurance that most carriers offer when you break your phone.
Purchased this phone in September of 2014 and for the first six months it was a decent phone, it was slow to respond and didn't live up to promised 4G speeds but I could live with that. After about six months it started dropping calls. In the last three months the touch screen started to become unresponsive basically it had good days and bad days and has gotten progressively worse. And now it will only connect to the about 30% of the time, I know it is the phone because my Niece also has Virgin Mobile and has no problem connecting to the network. I have tried restarting it and turning it of for periods of time and it does not help also ran antivirus through it and that was not the problem either. One of my first phone was a $20 Tracfone  that would do similar things but if I pulled the battery out it would reset and be fine but you cannot do that with this phone because the battery is sealed, another inconvenience. All in all I consider this phone to be a complete waste of money and will never purchase another HTC product, I purchased it to replace my very reliable Samsung Reverb because I wanted faster connect speeds BIG mistake. I would encourage anyone thinking of purchasing this to not waste the money it is GARBAGE!
Loving this phone!! Came from the galaxy s3 which had horrible battery life wouldn't even last me three hours bt and this phone out stands the s3 on every aspect so glad i got it!
One of the best smartphones I've ever owned. Great size. Colorful screen. Quick boot up. Only drawbacks are the internal storage. Has 8 gigs of space, but only 4 are accessible.
Amazing phone.  Love the size.  Surprisingly light weight. Comfortable to hold. Nice grip. Love the camera. Music sounds amazing. All in great phone especially for the price!
Not enough memory, I had to buy an extra sdcard but unfortunately, I can't move all the apps on the sdcard. Lot of junkware from HTC you can't remove. Otherwise, nice phone!
I love my HTC Desire 816
excellent phone.  just as good as the galaxy s5 if not better.  great battery.  5.5 inch screen and still more pettite than the iphone 6+.  no contract is the best feature
Great phone.  Battery life is terrific.  Fast.  Great camera.  Great screen.  The latest version of Android.  And  under $200 with no contract.  Couldn't ask for more.
If you are looking for a great smartphone without having to sign a lousy contract (and let's be honest, that is still what you have to do with major carriers), then this is the phone for you! for less than $200 you can outright purchase this great smartphone. The picture is crisp and clear, cameras are a HUGE plus, very good HTC "boomsound" speakers, very durable, and has a larger (still very thin) screen than most other phones! People will legit not believe when you tell them that you bought this for a monthly phone plan! With that being said, expect two major drawbacks! The internal phone memory is only 8GB, which is expandle by using a micro-sd (mine is 32gb), but it was almost useless because android is so junky. Also, now that i have had the phone for a year, the phone is starting to run slower and slower! By that i mean it takes 15 seconds (literally) to open up a thread of texts from your messaging app. This is extremely annoying, but after a year of use with only these few issues, I am very Satisfied. It is also worth noting that Virgin Mobile has been great and the service is always Terrific! Make sure you pick up a good quality, cheap case on amazon!
It was gabage it didnt work.. the battery died every 5 monites no matter how long you plugged it in and the fone would get so hot it felt like it was vurning ur skind
Writing this review from my new phone! I have been a long time Virgin Mobile customer.. I have had about six virgin mobile phones all together. I love that I can pick and pay as I please instead of having to pay an arm and a leg in order to have a smart phone.<br/><br/>This phone is just...wonderful. It is crazy fast, the screen is huge (I'm a small female and it fits my hands) the speakers are so loud! I upgraded to this phone after having the iPhone 4 for a couple years and I don't miss it even a little. I would have to cup the bottom of my iPhone when I was showing someone a video or put it in a bowl while listening to it at home...not anymore! The camera is also much better. It takes very crisp and bright photos (selfies are very crisp too lol). The thing I love most is that you can customize this phone to make it your own. There are many themes and color schemes to choose from and also many options to customize your phone experience. With the iPhone I felt a lack of customization big time! Overall this phone packs a punch! If you're looking for a reliable, customizable, high end feeling phone..this phone is for you. I would reccomend to a friend indefinitely.
Better than my old phone. The feel is more fluid. Only problem was the battery life doesn't seem to last very long. Other than that I am very happy with this phone.
I purchased this phone a few months ago when I was wanting to upgrade to a better quality smartphone on the Virgin Mobile network.<br/><br/>First thing that I love about this is the size of the phone and the screen. At first I was worried it might be too large, but it is fantastic. It is small enough to carry with you and put in your pocket or bag. Yet it is big enough to play games on, and everything that comes with a larger screen.<br/><br/>The cameras are what sold me. The back camera is outstanding, and takes amazing quality photos. The video camera also offers Full HD which is wonderful as well. Plus the selfie camera is fantastic!<br/><br/>It keeps a charge very well, and when it does run low, it recharges very quickly as well.<br/><br/>The sound on this phone is outstanding. Perfect for playing games, movies, and music.<br/><br/>I have only had 1 issue with it so far, and that being it shut down once on me, and I couldn't get it to turn back on. Finally after a half hour it came back on. I later determined that it had overheated from being on the charger, being used, and having a thick case on. Since then I have had no issues at all.
The HTC Desire is my first foray into the "phablet" zone of smartphone.  A friend of mine has an iPhone 6 Plus and this thing is exactly the same size, just a hair thinner.  We did some side-by-side tasks such as opening and operating apps, playing video, and re-booting the phone and each one performed those tasks at identical speeds.  The major difference - the HTC used only 2% of its battery versus the iPhone using 5%.  This is a fantastic phone.  My only complaints:  The phone is ENORMOUS!  If you're not used to a 5+ inch phone, it will take some time to get used to.  Say goodbye to one-handed operations.  The other complaint - HTC loaded up the phone with TONS of bloatware that I will never use, and it's incredibly difficult to get rid of.  The only tool that was worthwhile to me was the Phone transfer tool that used peer-to-peer WiFi to download all of the data on my old phone that Google had not backed up to the cloud (non-Google contacts, app settings, passwords, etc.).  It made initial setup a breeze and within 10 minutes of activating the phone, it had everything my old phone had - exactly where it was supposed to be.
Me and my husband received these phones. I love mine but my husband is old school so he doesn't like how big it is, but I'm completely happy with this purchase.
Arrived as expected. Brand new in the box. No issues. It's a pretty decent phone. I thought I'd miss having a white phone but I really like the color of this one. I'm really happy with my purchase. It runs great.. But like most HTCs it does take a little bit longer to start up. My suggestion for buyers would be to disable/uninstall unneeded apps and to purchase a SD card to ensure that it runs swiftly & smoothly while you have it. I really enjoy the launcher and being able to create my own themes for it. It's great for taking videos and pictures. I do not like the pre-installed picture editor on the phone, however. It doesn't have that great of options and the "selfie enhancing" features on the editor just make you look like a fish-eyed doll (NOT IN A GOOD WAY). It's not that big of a deal, though. The speakers are loud and clear. The battery life is awesome... When you're not in constant use. When you're using your phone without taking breaks and have the screen on full brightness, it does die more quickly... But, most phones do. When you first turn on the phone, you have to wait for apps to update so just be patient and let it do it's thing. I remember being worried at first with it taking so long to start up, but once it did and I was able to activate the phone with no issues..  I was beyond ecstatic :)
Great phone, we are very happy with it and Virgin Mobiles service plans.  The phone has great battery life - lasting 5 days of moderate use between charges.
Love it! This phone is a great phone. I'm not most high tech person, so for me this phone is amazing. My teenage daughter wants it and my husband does too.
I love this phone its fast and doesn't slow down at all and the battery is pretty awesome but I must say you should download CM security and clean master.
Amazing phone, gets the job done.. no matter what, definitly this phone is up the higher class of smartphones in the game! Thank you HTC & Virgin Mobile.
Love it! Great big screen, starts up fast, good battery life. This is the second one I bought for another family member. Picked this over Samsung Galaxy.
I switched from an iPhone 4s as I could not afford to replace an Apple phone. I did a lot of research and found that this phone was consistently getting great reviews on the camera quality and battery life.  I completely agree that the camera is of excellent quality considering this is a phone. However, all the focus on the camera must have taken away from the primary use of this product, which is to make and receive calls! Call quality is mediocre, at best, and the battery life is incredibly disappointing. I always use the power saver feature, close all apps, dim screen, etc. to save battery, but it just doesn't help even though I only use the genuine HTC charger instead of the cheap ones that fry your phone battery.  People always comment on how big this phone is. I like the size of the screen, but the phone is so slim and narrow it can be hard to keep in your hands. I've dropped this phone more than any other phone I've had.  Overall it's decent, but for the price I paid I was expecting a phone that could actually handle making phone calls and keep a longer battery charge.
First some specs. It has a nano SIM card slot, so if you wanted to try it out on another network, you could. Many but not all apps can be transferred to the 128 gb micro SD card (not included). The speakers sound awesome. It is a power hungery machine. One has to really dig into the settings for it to consume the battery at a reasonable rate. It does have a Power Saver funtion and an Extreme Power Saver function just like the Samsung S5. The Extreme Power Saver function turns the device into a GSM talk and text device with access to HTC's email and calendar apps as well. If your a guy who likes to keep your phone in your front pants pocket, this phone is too big. If your a guy who already has a "man bag" or wears suits or jackets on a daily basis, this is a great value. even full size web pages load fast and look good on the 720p display. It can be viewed nicely from any angle. This device has replaced both my old phone and tablet pc due to its size and speed. It does lack some features that Samsung phones offer, but for around half the price, I can live with that.
Wonderful phone. Loved it, although I would suggest not turning up the volume to loud as to avoid blowing out the speakers (especially the bottom one).
I wanted to wait a while to fully try out the phone before reviewing, so here it goes. This has to be one of the best phones I have ever had. I was wondering about the size at first, upgrading to a much bigger screen from what I had, but now I love it. I don't have problems with the power button like other reviewers have mentioned, I usually use both hands to hold my phone anyway. The battery life for me has been great, but then I always plug it in at night anyway, but even at work, in a concrete and steel building for 12 hours a day, I have at least 50% left to go home with. The phone also has two different power saver modes if you really need to conserve power. The "Boom Sound" front speakers are great too, no need for a extra speaker, and the boom sound improves the quality of the sound with headphones in too. One thing I did have to do is buy a case for it, the plastic shell felt a little uncomfortable in my hand (like it would slip out) and cases are hard to find for this phone, not a great selection. All in all, this is a great phone for a great price.
Prolly the best phone for Virgin available right now. The Samsung S5 is not worth the money when considering how powerful this phone is for the price.
Camera takes decent pictures and is slow, video is good, touch screen works well and looks fantastic, it can hold up to a 128gb sd card. (ONLY 8 gigs of internal, if you use a lot apps that could get tight and extremely annoying and crippling), its not a super perfect running performer but its ok. It's manufactured in Taiwan. After doing a lot of tweaking in different settings and apps I've vastly increased the battery life, although it barely makes it a day if I am using it a lot. It is versatile, as are most androids. If you are not good with smart phones or computers you may want to stick with an iPhone. It just takes some time and effort to get it all set up like you want it. Of course iPhone simply doesn't give you all the options, not to mention you spend a fortune for storage.<br/><br/>Sometimes the screen is just blank when someone calls, sometimes the keyboard simply will not come up when attempting to enter something. These small but potentially very crucial errors are a deal breaker for me. Oh, and the camera lens gets scratched very easily, aside from the camera being extremely slow and hard to focus properly. The battery life is DREADFUL. It is buggy and gets slower over time.<br/><br/>It feels solid like an iPhone, its a "sealed" phone like iPhone but it can be opened and the battery CAN be changed.<br/>Virgin has some cheap plans too, sprint network.<br/>I won't be buying another HTC due to the few crucial errors I have encountered.
This phone is great in every respect. It is big but still easily fits in my front pocket. The display is very clear. This phone was a super deal!
This phone is pretty amazing it's way better then my Samsung galaxy s3 the only problem I had with it is the camera it's not as good as I excpect
I like the phone. I was initially concerned about it's size, since I was used to a smaller phone. It took about a week for the phone to "shrink down" and not feel awkward anymore, in other words, I got used to it and now it feels weird when I pick up my old phone. The added real estate makes a world of difference to an old foggy like me, who wakes up every morning with a little less eyesight and a little less hair.<br/>As others have mentioned, the sound quality is amazing for such a small device. Now, it's not a heart stopping "boom box" by any stretch of the imagination, but it sounds great for what it is.<br/>It has a brilliant display from every angle. I have not seen a phone any clearer or sharper at any price.<br/>The cameras are pretty good. I've always had cameras on my cell phones, but I hardly ever used them because I'm a hobby photographer and I don't shoot with anything less than a DSLR. However, I can see myself taking pictures with this one from time to time. Coming from me, that'... Read more

My daughter loves her new phone.  Same size as a iPhone 6 plus but better price. Speakers are awesome! She loves everything about her HTC 816.
Well I've had the phone for a few days now. Coming off of a Samsung Galaxy S4 and a ripoff contract through Cellcom, I was leary at first but I watched and read a ton of reviews online before making the purchase, I became pretty confident and made the purchase, I'm glad I did. The S4 was hands down the best phone I ever hadhad. This phone coming right out of the box had an enormous impression size wise (enter:that's what she said joke #1), and I thought my S4 was big lol. The user interface that HTC has, very clean. It's taking some time to get used to, but it's nothing bad or difficult, just different. The screen resolution is on par with me, no visible pixels, plenty bright and very good color. The build quality is top notch, very nice design and material. One flaw though, as stated many times before in reviews, the back, it's glossy and a fingerprint MAGNET, very annoying. I suggest buying a case (good luck, very mediocre selection). The sound this phone produces through th... Read more
The phone is nice but I keep hearing complaints about the speakerphone option. People keep saying I sound distorted so it must be the phone.
This phone is about the size of a Galaxy Note 3.  It took a little getting use to the size, but my old eyes love having all that screen.  I've now had it over 8 months without issue.  The phone is a solid build and fits comfortably in my (big) hand.  I wouldn't say Apps initiate immediately (1.6 ghz quad-core processor), but I haven't had any noticeable lags during initiation.  It takes good photos for social media (13 mp rear, 5 mp facing); video quality is good with adequate lighting, not so good in dark surroundings (does have light/flash on phone), and audio recording is good. The display is crisp to view and very east to read (5.5" HD), protected by Gorilla glass.  There is significant glare on the screen in bright sunlight, making it almost impossible to see. Overall, for the price (now at $149), you cannot beat it.  It isn't an IPhone 6 Plus, but it isn't suppose to be.  I would definitely repurchase this phone (like, 4 of them) before I would buy an IPhone 6 Plus
I was looking for a slightly more updated phone than my S3 and LG Volt I'd had previous. This is what I chose.<br/><br/>720p Screen is adequate (1080p and 2k is not worth it).<br/><br/>The size means it still fits in my pockets, even on skinnier jeans.<br/><br/>The speakers are actually quite amazing, they are loud but still have a great quality, and more bass than I expected.<br/><br/>The onscreen home key, etc. has not bugged me a bit<br/><br/>The battery lasts quite well.<br/><br/>The things I didn't like (so far) are:<br/><br/>Ran out of onboard storage quick! The phone doesn't like to move apps to my 32gb sd card. If you want to use the space you have for games and larger apps, be prepared to compromise.<br/><br/>The light that indicates new messages and such is very easy to miss.<br/><br/>The Camera is lack-luster for a 13mp beast. It's better, yes, than the S3 or Volt, but if I record video, say, it is hard to watch due to the lack of quality @ 720p
The delivery made it on time as promised with 2 bd shipping. Overall I love the phone. My first phone was in my back pocket and took a hit to the power button, leaving it forever cycling between on and off. Usually I move on to another model but again I am in LOVE with this phone, so I looked around for for a replacement and was pleased to find it at half the price.<br/><br/>The phone is fast, responsive and rarely lags. I don't play a lot of games, mainly keeping up with my social and work life. I take tons'o'pictures and use it to help me get around the new area that I am living in. I do wish the battery had more staying power. By the time I have made it home and want to browse the web or veg out on candy crush the battery is in need of a charge. Need to go somewhere and use GPS?? Yeah, your phone may not make the day. I did myself a favor and grabbed a portable battery bank. Every night my beloved phone and its battery buddy get plugged in and prepped for another day.
So far this phone has been working perfectly. I heard a lot of negative comments about the battery life. It's true the battery life isn't long. It seems I would have to charge it daily if I wanted to really use all there is to offer; however, I realized a great deal of battery life was used to maintain this livefeed page or widget that takes up a full screen on the phone. It's constantly updating news and other media. I knew I could really live without it. I deleted the livefeed page (I forgot what it was called) and my battery life is extended to up to 3 days now with light use.<br/><br/>Another note: the screen is huge, not Galaxy huge but pretty big! It's perfect for those who have trouble texting due to large thumbs (like me!), reading ebooks, and watching movies on the go.<br/><br/>It's a great moderately priced android phone, does everything other phones can do. I did have to upgrade my virginmobile grandfathered plan of $40 to $45 monthly but big deal, I'm sold!
So let's get into this phone, no specs just how it's worked for me<br/>Pros<br/>This phone has a great camera, front and back<br/>Great video quality (I had a S4 and the video was awful video quality)<br/>Runs smooth mostly<br/>Good memory for price<br/>Good size, it may seem large at first, but you'll get used to it<br/>Sounds is amazing, and also has BoomSound for headphones(really good)<br/><br/>Cons<br/>There's space that could've been used as screen<br/>The buttons are on the touchscreen, and I'm not a fan of them.<br/>The battery, I thought, would be better<br/>It gets laggy if you don't clear app cache<br/><br/>This phone is a great mid price phone. It's a old size and the sound in it is good. If you're thinking about getting this phone, keep in mind that the battery is comaparble to a S4. It has good memory for price, and about service around your area. Mine is blazing fast with LTE so look into coverage before making the purchase.
Love this phone, is better than all my Galaxies. Does everything they did, plus more, with a bigger screen & much better battery life.
This phone can do pretty much anything myself or my wife need it to do....we both really like these....definitely like a small tablet
Who would have thought it was cheaper on Amazon. Amazon basically stands for amazing. Im so excited. It came fast from the seller in the virgin mobile packaging. Let me start off by saying this phone is huge! It super slim,sleek and at a price you can't beat. I got the phone, a tempered glass screen protector and a case for 195$.<br/><br/>Compared to an iphone, that's about $400 less if you were buying the phone. Its on the charger now because it just came in today but hopefully I can come back and update later on it's usage. For just being able to evaluate it visually and the packaging, it came as described, looks awesome and definitely an upgrade from my HTC evo 3d. Stayed with HTC but upgraded phones. They seem to make a good product for the value. I don't think you will beat this price until the phone gets way older technology wise but it was launched not too long ago I believe. That is all for now and I will try to update on usage later!<br/><br/>2/15/2015 UPDATE<br/><br/>Been using the phone for a few days. It's been great an easy to set up on virgin mobile. Battery life is pretty good. Keep a charger if heavy user of web surfing or apps but overall good. I installed a launcher because it gives a cleaner look but I just wanted to come back and let everyone know activation was easy. This phone came with the sim card encase anyone was wondering. Have a good one and enjoy this phone!
I love it everything about this phone. The size, specs, features, camera and the image quality are great. I strongly recommend it.
My HTC 4G 3D phone served me well for 3 years, but due to the small memory capacity, I needed to upgrade.  I looked on the VM website, but all they had that was clearly superior was the S5, which is $500.  I started to search for a phone the VM doesn't have on it's website, and I found the HTC Desire 816 much to my pleasure.<br/><br/>What a terrific phone!  It automatically switches between 3G and LTE and WIFI without me having to lift a finger.  The bluetooth 4.0 plays amazing sounding music through my car stereo, so I can stream slacker while I drive!  Sorry XM radio, no need for you now.  The graphic display is big, bright, and beautiful with crisp colors.  But the best part is the fluidity when switching between apps.  Apps spring open quickly, and there is no lag when swapping between them.<br/><br/>Plus, you can upgrade 4.4 kit kat to 5.02 lollipop right out of the box, and lollipop rocks!  Get this phone!
Bought myself this phone hoping I wouldn't need my reading glasses anymore. So far, so go. Some apps are still really small like the online free poker. So be it. Can only find accessories online so might as well buy them all together. Have to buy a hip case to get the ear plugs. Be aware that some of the products add to the number to Purchase on their own. (Unless my phone is hacked already.)<br/><br/>States battery last up to 7 days. Guess that's IF you don't do anything but phone calls. I run my battery down in 4-5 hours and that's with the battery saver on. I'm still trying to figure everything out.<br/><br/>Beware that warrenty doesn't go through on cart if you edit something. $100 deductable AND $7 a month. Just put that money in savings to buy your own. Talked to Virgin Mobile and they stated they do cover the very limited 1 yr manufacture warrenty but that's it. Their extended warrenty has simular terms.
I love this phone. It is wonderful. big 5.5 inch screen 13mp camera. A real social media phone Good speackers for playing music.
Best phone ever. Why pay $700? When u can get the same phone for cheap. Just need to buy ur memory if 8gb is not enough for you
The phone is amazing what you pay for great sound its has and the size of the phone is great as well good job virgin mobile.
I bought this phone to upgrade from my iPhone 4s which I  had used for a few years.  I've been using the phone for over a month and I have very little negative input on the phone.  The built-in camera takes excellent photos in daylight, but it's performance in low-light without flash is one of my few complaints - photos are washed out or blurry, with a slow shutter response time.  I'm happy with the ability to add to my storage space with an SD card, as my space on the iPhone was frustratingly limited.  The screen is large, and video/photos viewed on it are great quality, especially when streaming in HD.  No connectivity problems with wifi or Virgin Mobile. This is my first Android phone in 5-6 years, but I don't believe I will be going back to Apple after my pleasant experience with this phone.  Purchased this for about $150 from an Amazon seller and it's definitely worth the price.
This phablet is almost perfect with its good looks, nice display and superb performance. The only drawback are the cameras.
I absolutely love..love this phone!!! BEST phone I've had so far and I've had a lot of phones. And for a  great price!!!!!
This phone met and exceeded my expectations.  Great price.  Just under $150 new.  Using on Virgin Mobile (Sprint) network.
Awesome phone for the price! Just do yourself a favor and root it. The Virgin Mobile bloatware will cause SO MANY bugs.
It's a good phone. It's fast, I've never had an issue with it freezing, which is scary considering the battery is inaccessible. The screen is huge and is of good resolution, but has a lower pixel density that higher end phones. The rear camera is of good quality and front facing camera is higher in resolution than other comparable phones. The flimsy casing is something of concern. I've had mine over two weeks and the back of the phone has cracked starting at the headphone jack. The back is also a fingerprint magnet. For a mid range phone, it packs a lot of favorable specs at a good price.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>+ Large screen<br/>+ Fast processor<br/>+ Price<br/>+ Slim<br/>+ Light<br/>+ Camera Quality<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Fixed Battery<br/>- Plastic body/Flimsy feel<br/>- Glossy plastic back attracts fingerprints
I've only had this for 3 weeks and so far so good. Yes, it is a big phone! I love the big screen, which won't take long to get used to it. I've never had a tablet and I don't think I'll ever will because this giant phone seems to big enough to be used as a mini-tablet. Videos on youtube and Google Play Movies looked fantastic. The audio is also just as good. Touchscreen buttons haven't been an issue at all, easy to text and type.<br/><br/>One complaint I have is that it had too much pre-installed apps, especially Zoe, which takes up a lot. I also preferred TuneIn radio(on my old HTC One V) instead of this new NextRadio(HTC Desire 816). Not a big issue as you can just delete these unwanted apps.<br/><br/>I'll hold my opinion on the camera for now as I've only used it once so far. I will definitely give a 6 month or one year updated review.
The phone lasted less than a year and even then it was barely making it, through. The memory was for crap and on top of that it was constantly freezing and I was restarting it three to four times a day just to find I had multiple missed calls and texts. I would NEVER get another phone that didn't have a removable back. The battery life was TERRIBLE barely getting a days charge and the charger itself broken with in the first three months. I will never purchase another HTC product again. I usually never make reviews but this one had to be done because I wish someone would have warned me. The only and I mean ONLY positive thing I can say about this phone is that the camera was amazing, and took nice clear pictures. But that's it, everything else that makes a phone, it didn't have and I will never and I mean never purchase a HTC product again.
Best Phone I've ever owned!!! It is extremely awesome if you happen to be a photographer or videographer it has the capable tools to suit your needs. The zoom lens as with MANY regular camera tends to become a  bit pixelated when taking an up close tight shot but this is forgivable. My only beef is it doesn't have a quick-press camera button. Instead, you are forced to press by screen to initiate the camera app function. It does have the option to turn the volume button into a quick shot camera button, but I chose to use this for the camera zoom which to me is VERY important. Other than the aforementioned, I can't really say anything bad about this device. I'm constantly buying extra parts to help assist in my smartphone filmmaking. This thing is super AWESOME!! I find myself not being able to put it down as I have abandoned my tablets!!!
Awesome phone only drawback is the home screen is right above the space bar.Love the screen and the speed.and sound.
I am in love with this phone. The only concern I have is its memory. You may need to buy a memory card if required.
This is a much better choice than all those Samsung phones or Apple phones that come out every few months. The Virgin Mobile service offers everything I need for only $35 a month. I'm loving this phone.<br/><br/>The battery lasts all day with medium use throughout the day, if you are streaming video all day it wont last very long.<br/>Call quality is just right.<br/>Speakers are on the front so you don't have to flip over the phone to play music and risk damaging your screen.<br/>Screen size is just right, I wouldn't go any larger that the 5.5 inch screen, it just fits into my back pocket and is the perfect size for occasional video watching.<br/>Make sure to check the Virgin Mobile website to see how service is in your area before choosing ( we don't want to blame the phone for your poor judgment in service choice)
Great phone for anyone who doesnt feel like spending $600. Too much preinstalled bloatware but the price is right!
This phone is huge, it's definitely an adjustment if you're used to a smaller phone (my old phone case fits inside this one). The resolution and color and screen in general are very crisp and clear. The sound is a-mazing! I've used Virgin Mobile for 7-8 years now and this phone has more USEFUL features than any VM phone I've had. It didn't come loaded with a million apps (some, but not as many useless ones as usual). I thought it was odd that it didn't have an alarm app downloaded, but it's easy enough to download one on your own. My only complaint so far is the battery life. I let the battery charge completely before first time use and went the first day not using the phone for anything but texting/Facebook and in about 12 hours the battery was down to 30%. Not the worst I've ever had, but I've also had better.
I waited until I had this almost a week before writing my review. I do like the size and clarity of the screen. I can agree with everyone that the power button needs to be on the other side. My last phone was an LG Volt. I started running into battery problems with that. I wish this phone had some of that phones features. You can't personalize it as much. I am very happy with the battery life. I can charge it at night and with the battery saver on all the time, it's at 80% by the time I get home from work. That's with some texting while at work. The LG would be at 30-40% with the same use. The camera is more complicated to use. It has options like my Canon digital camera. It's going to take getting used to. Pretty good phone. I'll keep it. I do think it'd be hard to go back to a normal phone from a phablet now!
No disappointments.  Larger than I expected.  I came from an iPhone 4S and this is way better in every aspect.
What a nice phone! I had a Samsung Galaxy Victory that had terrible battery life so I did some research for weeks before buying. After looking at specs and reviews for many no contract phones, I decided I wanted a quad core CPU with more than a gig of RAM. That led me to this phone... and I'm so glad I bought it, it's really snappy, I didn't know how much difference in performance there would be, but wow, it's night and day. The screen is super bright, the speakers are great, the battery is really good for the screen size, and it took about 3 minutes to activate 😊<br/>I would say the only downside is that it's big enough that it's hard to hold and text with the same hand accurately. That being said, my tablet sees a lot less use now, so go buy this phone, you won't look back.
Got this as a replacment for the S3. I've had it a day and a half and am rather impressed so far. It's nice.
Had this phone for a month it is a great buy! Definitely worth double than the price I got on here $170. Phone works great, call clarity is pretty good (better than my iphone), speakers are freaking loud (almost as loud as my laptop), the camera is amazing took some photos at work and the 13 megapixel camera kicks ass! Below is a photo I took at work the other day! The phone is exactly the same size of the large iPhone 6, for a big guy this phone finally feels right in my hands! OHHH and the kicker, most of the cases for this phone are pretty cheap and great quality!<br/><br/>P.S. phone charge is about a day with heavy use, power saver doesn't make a huge difference. The phone also syncs with google +, google accounts, and google docs so as a student I am always up to date!
Sim card doesn't stay in without a case on it.  I always use a case but frustrating to not have the choice.
This 816 replaced a Samsung Galaxy III. There was a couple of days learning curve involved, but overall, this is a grown-up Galaxy SIII.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Much better sound with watching something, listening to music or talking on the phone.<br/>Hard button for taking a picture.<br/>Processing speed.<br/>Clear and detailed screen<br/>Fewer irritating bundled apps which cannot be uninstalled<br/>Takes excellent picture in good light.<br/>Battery life and charge times are impressive.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>More Fablet sized than phone sized<br/>Picture quality only so-so with lowish light<br/>Needs a screen cover because no gorilla glass<br/><br/>This has an SD card slot (up to 32GB) and is not only easy, but actually fun to use compared with the SIII.
I don't get the latest greatest phones, so for around $200.00 this was a good deal. The screen is large, the camera and video work great. While a fairly big phone the weight is very light. The processor in this phone is very snappy. I have no lag between actions. I recently forgot to plug it in overnight, waking up the next day I was very concerned as my last phone (Samsung Galaxy 3) always ran out of charge if I didn't plug it in overnight, much to my amazement, only about 2% of the battery had drained. Excellent battery life!<br/>I had a HTC thunderbolt a few years back and have always loved the quality of their phones.<br/>PRO's<br/>Excellent Battery life<br/>Excellent Camera and video<br/>Excellent performance<br/><br/>CON's<br/>None I can think of
I couldn't activate my phone because virgin said this meid was in use. was my "new" phone used?
I saved 70 dollars... I love it! Battery isn't great but def worth it... I'm just an HTC fan all around
Now I can see why this phone is a fantastic value.The best phone I own to date.The big size is just fine.I am a photographer ,and showing my images on a big screen is a big plus.I perform a lot of editing of my images and find the screen with having high sharpness and great color.This camera is impressive considering it is on a smart phone.The only minus is the 8 gig storage. Since I have other tablets I do not need to download lots of apps.Just the ones I use all the time.I have discovered that you need to leave ample room for updating.You will fill up your internal storage quickly filling .Install at least a 32 gig sd card for your videos and pictures.Other then that, I am enjoying this phone and it is a lot cheaper then the IPhone plus.
Not too shabby of a phone, replaced a SIII with this, one big gripe is how close the power is to the volume buttons, that took some time to get used to, and the usb media seem to start "smith"? haven't looked for this program yet , but usually crashes the usb media function in my 2014 dodge 1500. Not to hip on an internal battery either, but the batter life is about to be expected due to the size of the display and  options etc that you can use. I get about 1/2 a day if I use "waze" and about 10 hours of normal desk use.... The menu system could be a bit more customary, really dont want to root it just to get a better UI, so will keep looking for a phone that does suit my needs when more become available for Virgin mobile.
It's a nice phone htc knocked out of the park with the 816 only downside is not enough internal memory
My son loves this phone, best thing I ever bought for him.  I will be getting one in the coming weeks!
Outside of Amazon sitting on my order for 5 days, finally shipping it on day 6, I will say that I love the phone. All specs other than the (slightly slower)1.6 quad core proc., everything is comparable to the big, bad expenssive phones ($400-$600)..Outside of a promotion or signing a two-yaer contract, I dare you to find a better phone for the $. Hands down best mic and speaker combination I've ever had or even heard. Virgin, well: it is what it is. live somewhere that has service, you won't be disapointed, live somewhere that you hardly have signal, you wont be happy. Phone is big and smooth and runs faster than I expected.<br/>Amazon shipping and communication: 3 stars<br/>Virgin Mobile Service: 3 stars<br/>HTC Desire 816: 5 stars
i had an LG Optimus V for the past couple years. it was my first smartphone. although it was still working well, i realized it just didn't have the storage capacity, the screen size, decent loading time, or call clarity. i upgraded to the HTC Desire 816 based on reviews and price.<br/><br/>totally worth it! finally, i can scroll through twitter quickly and watch youtube (something the optimus couldn't handle). the picture clarity is great. and the call clarity is fantastic. i'm no longer straining to hear the other person at the end of the line. i uninstalled and/or stopped running pre-loaded apps i don't need, use the power saving option, and have no complaints about the battery life. for well under $200, this is a great smartphone.
The phone has it's good qualities like being able to save things to the SD vs internal storage but there are some serious cons. If you choose to engage the security feature it's always a three step process, button on, swipe THEN security which is time consuming and annoying. I was expecting a LOT more from the camera. It's the slowest I've ever used. I have a toddler and can NEVER catch him in a picture because it's seriously almost always a full second between my pressing the button and it taking the actual photo. The video function constantly turns my videos blue. You can see as soon as you switch to video that it completely changes the coloring of what's happening. I've tried a lot of different settings and it's made no difference.
the HTC Desire is an awesome cell phone!  although it is quite larger than my previous phone, i really like all the perks it offers and the camera is everything i had hoped it would be:)) havent added a plan yet, wondering if $35/month will be enough to get all the text/talk/etc i want. My 14yr old daughter says the speakers are REALLY great:) i kind of wanted to be able to slip this in my pocket or purse. May just keep this and use my other phone for talk/text as it is smaller and really wont matter if i drop it or lose it anywhere. Dont want to let this too far out of my reach though. All the apps are great if you use snapchat, instagram, facebook etc. I like that if i go somewhere i have a GPS/map and also the weather channel:))
Can;t seem to get the camera to focus. Too many blurry pictures. Other than that the phone is great!!
Super performer. My gripe is on an 8 gig phone most  the space is taken by pre-installed bloat ware
Great cell. I will admit. I will not have anything other than an HTC at this point... so my opinion might be a bit biased, but still. One thing that could use improvement as with all HTCs, is battery life. However, I found that if you know how to 'not waste battery life' it will be more than sufficient for the whole day and even compete with "max-saver" phones. I must also say that I am a little disappointed with the low internal storage of the phone; it should have had 16GB, not 8. But well, I guess that's a trade off for the other features the cell has. Ahh, RAM could have been a bit better as well, but this really is not much of a problem, as it should be more than sufficient for regular cell phone users
Good phone nice and sharp for a 720p display don't let that fool and it's fast trust me.
All in all, this is a solid phone. I love the screen size, the camera, and the sound quality. Coming from the HTC Evo 4G/3D, I was weary about upgrading but you can't beat the price. It feels nice to have an updated OS and HTC sense.<br/><br/>The only con is the space, or lack there of but then again I transferred literally all my apps and files from my old phone onto this one before loading my old SD card. Once I did that, space was no longer an issue. Not too keen on the blinkfeed or the gallery app but that's just a personal thing.<br/><br/>Once again android and HTC have won me over. So nice to finally have a real new phone.
This is a great phone. I love the giant screen. It's quick and fluid especially for the price. The speakers are so good that I use them more than my headphones, HTC is ingenious for putting front facing speakers. The only downfalls for this device is the mediocre battery life, and pitful camera. I seldom take pictures so the camera isn't that much of a problem for me, but the battery life is pretty bad. I can get a full days worth of use if I use it lightly. On the days I use I heavily I will have to charge mid day. It's gotten to the point where I always carry around a external battery charger. I hope HTC upgrades the desire line in the future with battery life. Best phone I've had on virgin mobile for sure.
Absolutely love it! Best phone i've bought, even my mother got one because she got jealous! haha.
Blown away! This phone is phenomenal. Stunning graphics, perfect size, very customizable, crisp, clear audio (during calls and when playing music, etc.), simple to use, so far great battery, no lag when playing graphic heavy games, streaming Netflix is a breeze so fast and so clear and crisp! Bought mine from HSN so I could take advantage of flex pay and bundles but I purchased my case here on Amazon. I went withstanding wallet case because it seems like it would provide the most protection can't find any otter boxes hopefully they are making one, the case I have works great for now. The size is so great! I just love it!
Very nice phone! Sturdy and responsive. Great speakers with rich sound. Perfect for games, movies, or music. Excellent 13 megapixel rear cam. 5 megapixel front cam. It's got a lot of screen space, so if you're looking for a large phone that won't break the bank, this is an excellent choice. Paid $175 for mine with $55 a month (no contract) Virgin Mobile service. VERY AFFORDABLE! People who want a status symbol choose iPhones. People who want real phones with all the trimmings of an iPhone and much more, but don't want to shell out hundreds of dollars extra for 2 year old tech, choose phones like the HTC Desire 816. Really Apple??? Only an 8 megalpixel camera on a 600-800 dollar phone? Skimp much?
Brand new in package for $70.00 less than even Virgin Mobile is selling them for. Amazing phone.
I was looking to buy the Virgin mobile supreme again, but they seem to have been discontinued. So I was trying to find a good phone with a nice, hd and a bigger screen. And I came across the HTC 816, and I Must say I like it better than the supreme.  The phone is bigger that what I expected. sometimes it hard to hold since its so big, but I become adjusted to holding. I like the picture, its very clear and it takes really nice clear pictures. I wish the phone would come with more phone space, and they would not all of that bloatware that you cannot delete. That's probably the only thing I don't like about this phone. I also notice the went down $20 since I bought and that was about a month ago.
Phone overall was great except for the android and HTC updates which killed the internal memory
Awesome upgrade from iPhone 4s! Came early. So happy I got it. Nice, big, and great camera. :D
5/5 love my HTC 816 love everything about my new phone and can't wait to show it off, kudos!!!
Great quality phone for HTC fans with long lasting battery and HD videos and great for games.
I really love this phone, it's wonderful and definitely an upgrade from the dreaded LG Volt!
I've had this phone for over two months now and I still love it. I was in search for a new phone and I spotted this phone in RadioShack but it was wayyy out of my budget. My ma had a smart idea to see if it would be cheaper on Amazon and it was so I purchased it right away. The shipping was pretty fast. It came like two days after I ordered it. If you're a female with big hands like myself and want a nice sized phone to make your hands feel smaller, lol, this is the right purchase. Or if you just want a bigger phone to have with cheap monthly payments this is definitely a two thumbs up. If you do buy it, I hope you enjoy it as much as I've been enjoying mine.
Perfect phone for me. Love the camera. Love the size. The quality of the phone is definitely amazing. It does not feel or look cheap. The only downfall to the phone is the storage and that there aren't many cases out for this phone. But if neither of those are an issue for you, then this phone may be for you. I really enjoy the settings on the phone in regarding of conserving the battery life. The battery life within itself is pretty long for me. This phone took awhile to prepare for shipment but I was able to get it in two days after it was shipped. I'm very happy with my purchase and I would purchase this phone again without hesitation if I ever needed to.
It's the only Virgin Mobile phone that I could find in my price-range with more than 1 GB of internal storage. Since Google has made it impossible to store apps on external memory, I wanted something that could handle more than the bare minimum of apps. I love the HTC 816. First, it has great picture quality. It's great for watching videos on because it's about 6 inches tall and 3.5 inches wide. I call it a phablet because it's like a phone and a tablet. It's really easy to read news articles on because I can make the type large-enough. It seems to process fast, but I don't play many games (Fruit Ninja only). It's fun to customize and easy to use.
I love this phone! Great size. Not too small not too big. Have always loved HTC products!
This phone has known issues with the power button (I wasn't aware of this at the time of purchase)!  Three days after purchasing, the power button broke. I've tried taking the phone to various cell phone repair shops and no one can fix it.  The back of the phone does not come off, so there's no battery to remove or a way to get into the phone to fix any issues. I have all kinds of problems with trying to reset it if it freezes or the power button is stuck. I give it 3 stars because the size of the screen and resolution is very nice. I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy it though. I will never again buy a phone where you can't remove the battery!
I received my smartphone yesterday in estimated time. Appreciate you Seller! =) I love this smartphone... The camera takes great pictures, the speeds is fast & lag free, HTC U.I. looks awesome & simple; they don't have lots of unnecessary bloatware apps like Samsung have! HTC kept it minimal on apps that everyone will uses daily! I thought 5.5in was gonna be too big, but it's not... I can type with one hand & see more informations on the screen via websites & social networks. This phablet is the right size, even if you have average size hands. If anyone wants to buy the HTC Desire 816 by Virgin Mobile; I recommend this seller! =) I'm happy! =)
Arrived quickly and in excellent condition. So far I am satisfied and like this phone.
Snappy & attractive. An inexpensive mid-tier smartphone that does what I need it to do: phone, text, email, VPN, and remote desktop. I don't play games on my phone, so I'm not certain of that kind of performance. The phone clarity is superb. Bluetooth sync works in my Volkswagen, perfectly. Track listings & artists always show up in the VW HUD. YouTube works great. The 4G service is fast, too. Not a bad camera, either. Screen is only 720p, but that is good enough for me at the price it is sold at. Very clear. Battery life is really good - high usage & it keeps on truckin' all day & night long. Highly recommend this phone.
OK Really 4 and a half stars. Taking half off for notification volume. This phone is a great phone for the price. Smooth, and peppy. Screen res not as high as my last phone (Samsung s3 ) but still great. The front facing speakers and the boom sound software - Excellent! I mean WOW!!! Sounds great. That being said the notification sounds could benefit from the sound software but unfortunately it does not, making the notification sound a little lower than i would like. Hence the half star deduction.<br/>I would recommend this phone for those an a budget or just not willing to put out 300 or more on a really good phone.<br/><br/>OK UPDATE: To make notification sounds louder it is best to use mp3 files that way the boom sound will activate and make it much louder and easier to hear.<br/>Also i saw complaints about poor battery life. For me not the case. My S3 would need to be charged by 2pm everyday. My day starts at 4 am with fully charged phone. This phone at 4pm still has about 65% battery life left. So great battery life for me.
I'm an old, gray bearded, man, who has been painlessly sucked into the 21st century by this phone on a belt clip. Very nice. Previously I only bought very cheap, phones that had become more or less obsolete. Love the sound on this as  I stream YouTube videos, or the beautiful photos when I check for recent sightings on my Audubon Bird guide app. I even can understand everything being said, and vice versa, on my phone calls! I still like the illusion of freedom of pay as you go. I've seen on articles from the interwebs that providers are finally starting to catch onto this same idea! Who knew I was so forward thinking!
Great mid-range smartphone for the price. Exceeded my expectations. I went from an iPhone 4s to the HTC Desire 816 and I honestly enjoy this phone better due to a larger screen and watching movies. However this is not the best camera phone and if you are looking to take  pictures with this phone good luck STAY AWAY, you're better of with an iPhone but it's gonna cost you. I recommend looking at your needs and wants and your budget when making your decision and everyday practical use. This phone is great for me but is not for everyone especially if you're a girl and love taking a lot of pictures like my girlfriend.
Good, sturdy phone. I've dropped it numerous times and it has held up just find with very minor scuffs on the corners from the impact. Was actually able to physically rub out a scuff. Phone is very fast, I have a bunch of apps loaded onto it and It's never lagged, froze up, or anything. Picture quality is good, screen is vivid. I expected the speakers on this phone to be a bit louder. (They are loud, but just not as loud as I expected them to be by any means. // they are about as loud as a galaxy s3's speaker, if that can bring you any comparison. Although these speakers face towards you, which is a HUGE plus)
What a fantastic phone/tablet (phablet), especially for the price! The image quality is just fantastic. It is 720p which is lower than high end phones (1080p), but the difference is hardly noticeable. The contrast and colors are near flawless. Sound is amazing, probably the best I've heard on a phone. Camera is 13mp but doesn't take fantastic photos. Photos don't look bad at all, just not great. Kind of a shame due to the fact the rest of the phone is so high quality. If you are looking for a no contract phablet phone in the 200-300 dollar range, this is a no brainer. I couldn't be happier with this purchase.
This phone is complete garbage. It comes with 8GB internal and the OS takes 5 gigs. After app updates, I have room for 2, maybe 3 apps. So the phone is worthless. I had to root the phone, only to find out that I need to partition my SD cards to push apps to it. Did that, pushed apps to the SD card and it was all good. Rebooted and the card wouldn't mount and the phone wouldn't boot because of it. Had to factory reset and I'm back at square one... with a totally worthless phone. DO NOT buy this phone. Future you will than you.
The phone is awkwardly large.  I keep my phone in my back pockets and it seems that it is constantly protruding from the tops of my pockets.  This fact makes the phone easier for someone to steal and easier for me to lose it if I bend down/over.  I have longer than normal fingers and find it difficult to swipe as easily as in the past on my HTC Evo.<br/><br/>Pros: The camera is great.  I love the OS and display.  It's wicked fast and hasn't frozen up on me yet.  The sound is AMAZING.<br/>The cons: the out of the box storage capacity is crap and the size of the phone I think is just a tad too large.
coming off Galaxies which I never really liked.  Poor battery. Lagging.  I do a 2 step program.  I have one phone for posting, camera, music, radio and one dedicated phone for voice an LG90.  This is more practical than it sounds.  My Desire is on my Optimim wifi.  My LG90 is on TMobile.  Both phones give me tons of juice.  The Desire gives me superior photos and amazing sound.  The LG90 was only $100 and it is full featured, a good size and excellent battery life.<br/><br/>I have since dropped the HTC on a tile floor while changing cases.  Dead.  Relying strictly on my LG90 which is a very nice phone except I'm a talk radio chick and even though I keep buying every BT gadget under the sun, I really miss the ease and convenience of my amazing sound /speakers in the HTC.  I absolutely never go backwards but for the current price, I can afford to have my premium sound and fancy camera again.  I never missed a phone before. I always upgraded but I miss this phone.<br/><br/>One phone doesn't do it for me.  It's annoying and there is no reason not to keep your old phone hooked up to your wifi.
This is a very nice phone.  The battery lasts twice as long as my previous phone.
loved, loved, loved, this phone!!!! would buy 100 times over and over again!!!!!
Wonderful phone!!!!!! Can't beat vm monthly charges 38 a month....beautiful.....
Very good phone!  I love the screen size and clarity.  It is awesome!
Buy your phone from Virgin Mobile's Official site as it does promise a 1 year manufacturers warranty on phones bought directly from them which covers malfunctions from the device. Some vendors do not offer any type of warranty so your best bet, even if it's slightly more expensive, is to go with the smart choice of being able to rely on them if anything goes wrong. Overall a great phone, very fast, Camara takes quick well lit pictures, a phone meant to be used with both hands and quiet bigger than the S5. Switched over from a galaxy and I prefer HTC now due to the customization.
I've had this phone for 2 months now and I love it.. The size is a bit intimidating when you first open your box... But that quickly goes away. Call quailty is great. To decline and answer a call is a bit odd. Back camera is decent. Front facing not so much. But I can deal with it.  For the price and being on a cheaper plan Im satisfied. Oh for any spint users wanting to transfer your number you hv to call them directly. Virgin mobile is on the same network as sprint and you can not activate online. And to speak with someone press zeros til it transfer you to customer service
It is a fantastic phone! I love it and all but I have three problems.<br/>  1) I can never find good cases to protect it.<br/>  2) The speaker on top of the phone is now louder than the bottom speaker(I don't know why and how long it has been going on).<br/>  3) And after five months(I received it on December 21st ish)....for some reason...the SIM card now won't read...I have yet to figure out why. It was good one day, then in and out for a day and the next day it is gone. WiFi and everything still works...just no calling and texting...which is why I have a phone.
This is by far the best phone virgin mobile has ever had in terms of price and quality. Haven't dropped it too much because I've heard it breaks easily so get a case with it but other that that this is the best phone you can get that's actually worth the price. Also it is quick and will do everything you need it to do and even better yet still have battery. I have yet to make this die in one day. I have at least %40 left at the end of a 16 hour day so this battery is pretty good donwside, unremovable. But I would reccoment to everyone (switched from HTC desire 601)
good phone nice screen decent battery life and pretty smooth operating system
This is a great Android phone for the price.  It has everything you need.  My wife and I are both very happy with the 816.  The screen is big and has a very clear and bright image.  The sound is really nice too - loud when you need it.  The speed is good and there is plenty of memory once you move some things over to your SD card.  You could spend more and get the new Samsung Galaxy, but you really would not be getting much more in terms of day to day functionality.  Also, the phone seems very sturdy.  I have already dropped it a few times and no problems at all.
I'm really impressed that Virgin offers such a large phone at such a reasonable price. I'll let others post their technical benchmark results, but I can say that I've had the Note 3 and even if Virgin offered both, I would choose the 816 Desire. Just the general feel of navigating menus and opening applications is quicker on the 816, the screen is nearly as big as far as I'm concerned, the camera is great, and with Virgin's monthly rates, this phone is incredible. To be fair though, the Note 3 excels in most areas, I'm just giving my overall value rating.
Upgraded to this phone a few weeks ago and I love it.  It took 2-3 days to get used to the larger size but now everything else seems too small.  The phone works great and is so much faster than my old phone.  There is plenty of room to install apps.  The screen is clear and everything looks great-pics,  videos,  apps.  The battery life is decent.  If I just text and Web browse it lasts all day.  If I play games a bit more then it needs a charge in the evening.  I would recommend it if you are looking for a bigger phone without breaking the bank.
This phone is a little large, so I can't really hold it with one hand for most things, but it's very slim and light and the screen is responsive.  All my favorite apps work great with it.  I just wish there was less HTC software loaded on it since these apps are pretty large and take up memory.  I've had it for about a month and a half now and I haven't had any problems with the hardware. It also charges very quickly. Virgin mobile also offers great plans and together the phone and plan are very affordable compared to other options out there.
Have used the phone for about a month now and am pleased with this with a few caveats.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Large brilliant screen<br/>Very good call quality<br/>Excellent battery life<br/>Fast processor<br/>Cons:<br/>Slow shutter speed<br/>Somewhat flimsy construction<br/>Does not come with an SD card, so factor the cost of one into the price comparison<br/><br/>For the money and if you are on Virgin Mobile, this is a great phone.  Not sure if the on/off & volume buttons will last two years, which is my usual upgrade cycle.
I bought this phone after coming off a Sprint contract with a Samsung Galaxy S3. I bought it off QVC for $189.00. I was first impressed with the sheer size of the phone. I recently compared my phone to an iPhone 6+ and they were the same size. I am confident I bought a GREAT product for a nominal price. The LTE is blazing fast. I was finding it difficult to find a CDMA phone that was feature filled for a sub $200 price. In fact, I'm waiting for the HTC Desire 820 to drop so I can buy that and gift my current phone to a family member.
This is an outstanding phone for me.  It is the best phone I've ever had however my last phone was a galaxy S2 so of course this is a step up.  The battery life is amazing.  I just woke up and looked at my phone and the battery was only down by 1/4 and I unplugged it yesterday morning. I do keep it on the battery saver mode though. Haven't noticed any change in performance with keeping the setting there. I would so recommend this phone for anyone. Love the front facing speakers. Camera is great. Shipping is superfast here on Amazon.
This phone has it all!! This is the only phone I have ever owned that I don't have a single complaint about. It's fast, high quality, and exceeds my high standards regarding Android based phones. Its so versatile that I have not needed to use my computer one time since getting this phone. The battery life especially surprised me. Androids normally do not have the best battery life, but with this phone, I just use the 'power save' option, and it lasts the whole day, even with moderate to heavy usage. I highly recommend this product!
I wanted a larger screen but did not want to pay the price for a Note 4 or other similar phablet. The HTC Desire 816 fit the bill. Although the screen is not 1080p or better, it still is beautiful and great for viewing videos. In addition, the dual front facing speakers project sound better than most other cellphones. The only gripes I have are that the battery is not user replaceable; Android Kitkat (does not allow direct to micro SD card install); only 8 GB of internal memory; left-side location of the power button and bloatware.
I can't say anything about this phone that isn't already covered by the other reviews except I've dropped it about 900 times in the last year and the worst I've ever done to it is crack the glass in the corner, slightly. Doesn't even go over the screen. Surprisingly rugged for such a big and thin phone. Also the battery life is abysmal, but i learned to work around it.<br/><br/>Honestly though, I regret upgrading to lollipop and I'm hoping when I buy a new Desire 816 that I can avoid it. Worse battery life and worse performance.
huge display i love it the speakers are super loud and it was under $200
Upgraded from a HTC evo 3D. It's such a nice phone. Big screen and loud.
I've had this phone for 7 months now and haven't given me any problems hasn't slowed down. I love the size of the screen and pretty much everything about it. I've had galaxies and iPhones but there's something about this phone I like better than those.  I would definitely buy this phone expecially if you're getting your first smartphone pretty easy to use or if you just want a bigger phone for a cheaper than every other phone company charges.  I got to my house in like 2 days.  Very happy with this product I would buy it again.
My daughter has been trying to get me to buy a smartphone fr awhile. After trying a smaller I-phone from this company that I wasn't happy with I bought the desire. I love it. The screen is wider than my old phone. Easy to set up. Easy to navigate between apps. The battery is much better  than with the old phone. The camera resolution is fantastic. I wish the reception was stronger but that is more the carrier than the phone and I live in the out back. Good phone for the price. It rates up their with the higher priced phones.
I'm very pleased with the phone, and the service I received with Amazon
Shipping was fast (with Amazon Prime) The package came in a box with bubble protection. Phone came in Virgin Mobile retail packaging.<br/>Set up is easy with an existing Virgin Mobile account. The phone came preloaded with a bunch of apps that took up almost half of the 8GB of memory on the phone. Battery life isn't all that great probably because of all the apps running in the background. BUT the phone is great. Nice set up and layout. Extremely nice camera. Snapdragon makes the phone move really fast. LTE is great too!
I purchased two of these for my wife and I.The sale price and reviews made the decision a no brainer.These replace two Virgin Mobile Awe phones.They are one of the best purchases I have made.Clear sounding,great reception,and awesome screen.Sound is very good,I wish it were louder.I am not a phone person,personally hate them,but these are fun to use.I play Pandora One using Bluetooth in the wifes car,and it connects flawlessly with no skipping,keeping its signal throughout.Mine shows LTE signal here in southwest Ohio.
Good for the money. It's fast and  the screen was better than expected
I freaking love this phone its everything I wanted and moreeヽ(^。^)丿
I started out really enjoying this phone, it's absolutely amazing for the price point. Unfortunately my screen has started to freeze and flicker and the phone will reboot. I'm not sure if I just have a defective model or if this is just an issue of cheap components. I really want to love this phone, but the screen issues are really annoying. I purchased this phone in late september so the phone isn't even a year old. I'm  wondering how I can get it replaced since it is still under warranty.
I LOVE this phone! A d I didn't overspend on it. A terrific buy. HTC is awesome, great camera , great speakers and all this in an incredibly easy to use package. The Desire 816 is larger, about the size of a 3x5 card, but for me, that's a good thing- eyesight issues and large or fumbly fingers are absolutely no problem.<br/><br/>The battery has never even come close to running out, barely even losing an eighth of it's charge when I take it out for the day. I give it a 5 star rating - A+++
good product easy install large screen and has a nice keyboard set
Good Phone But The Battery Runs Out Quick Can't Beat The Price $ .
The LCD is weak and will break easily when dropped on any surface.
I love this phone it does so much and more!!! 😁money 💸well spent
Switched from a iPhone 4 and dont miss it at all,  the only major deal breaker that I have with this phone is that mine came with a bad headphone jack input,  everytime I connect my headphones,  they just would stop working due to poor connectivity and I tried different types of headphones,  so at this point I don't want to bother returning the phone, so I'm using my old iPhone still for my workouts, is sad couse if it wasn't for this essential manufacturing issue I'd give this phone 5+
I love this phone with it's 5.5" screen and excellent WiFi capabilities. The rear  camera is 13 megapixels and is a serious upgrade from my last phone. The music on this device is very good with the dual speakers. I would recommend downloading an equalizer from GooglePlay for an<br/>added boost. only little negative is the battery life. If you are careful and use power saver when you can you should not have an issue. Got this for an amazingly low 179.00 and I am very pleased.
My experience with this phone so far is great. It's a little big but it's still comfortable. Compaired to my last phone (iPhone 4) this thing is amazing. The audio is amazing with the boom sound and the battery life Will last me a good day and a half  with normal use. Over all you can't beat it for the price. And if you did what I did and looked up videos to decide if you wanted it and thought you might need a SIM card you don't, it's included and already in the phone ready to go!
Pros<br/>Easy to use<br/>many features<br/>HTC Boomsound plays music great<br/>most apps work flawlessly<br/>budget high quality phone<br/>feels nice in hands<br/>Huge like the recent phablets<br/>Amazing 13MP Camera<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Cant swap battery<br/>battery sometimes doesn't last that long<br/>glossy finish (preference wise)<br/><br/>For more go to video review (replace (dot) with a . )<br/>youtube (dot) com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v;=SNH4h9OpRGA
Though not state-of-the-art, this phone delivers! Graphics aren't super-crisp, but they're fine, and the screen is huge. The built-in speakers are amazing for vocals and higher-pitched sounds (don't expect much for bass or drums). The 4G LTE speed is not blazing, but it can stream songs from Google Play and videos from YouTube effortlessly. It comes with a recent version of KitKat, which gives a very smooth user interface experience.I really like it and would buy it again.
Everything about this phone has been great. I've only had it for 3 days, but only one complaint so far. The battery life. I will take this phone off of the charger at 100% and 4  & 1/2 hours hours later with moderate use I am down to 25% and plugging it in. Everything else is great. The camera is amazing, and the front camera isn't bad either. Apps run smoothly, and I haven't experienced any lag. 4 stars, but only because I have to bring my charger with me everywhere I go.
I bought this phone for my husband's birthday couple months back, he loves it except one huge problem, no storage. I bought a 64G SD card, hoping that it will fix the issue, but not at all.  Kept saying no storage available, the apps, games and media won't store on the SD card and the phone kept saying no storage available. Not so happy about it. The phone came with a lot of apps that we don't use at all, yet we can't delete those apps, anyone knows how to fix this issue?
This is a great (albeit very large) phone.  I did have a problem applying the system update to Lollipop but was able to use the HTC Sync desktop tool to do it.  I previously had the LG Volt, which was also a good phone but this one is even better.  I now have a fully functional web client in my pocket.  The large screen makes typing and viewing much easier than on smaller phones.  Performance for all tasks has been great, battery life has been great too.  No complaints!
Very nice and well constructed phone! Very loud also!
Fast shipping and what a great phone for the price.  Thank you.
this is one of the best phones I have ever had. The camera both front and back are just absolutely amazing. That was one of the biggest selling points to me. this phone is just absolutely amazing. it is the fastest phone I have had with virgin mobile so far. the battery life is also really good surprisingly. I would have never thought that a mid range phone would have such flag ship qualities. I highly recommend this phone to anyone who is on virgin mobile!!!
Love the htc desire 816 by virgin mobile works great! I enjoy the big 5.5 inch screen fits perfect in my hand. Its definitly an eye catcher..Worth the price..Gotta say Amazon is the best and trust worthy place to shop if you cant trust no other site then this is the best place for you. Your packages arrive on time and in perfect condition.Im glad i purchased my phablet here love it cant keep away from it, works great. I would recommend this phone to anyone.
Bought this to replace one I bought 4 months earlier.  Has a known problem with the power button sticking, but my 18-yr old son loves all the rest of the features so much that we are trying it again.  I can say the case & glass is pretty tough and handles dropping etc.  Get a cover for it that protects the power button.  He says that the camera, the ease of use, the screen size, OS, phone/text functionality are all superior to others in this price range.
For the money, you're not going to find a better phone. For more money, you might, but then, if you had a lot of money to blow, you'd already have bought your Samsung Galaxy or iPhone. Call quality is probably more "okay" than "great," but the screen size is outstanding, and resolution is surprisingly clear. Again, there are better phablets out there, but they will cost you more money; you aren't going to find a better under-$200 phablet.
Went from the iPhone 4 to this phone... It feels great to be back with an android phone! The best thing about this phone besides the screen (which is large and looks fantastic) is the fact that I have yet to feel any lag during use. My iPhone just always seemed to lack much of the hype that all "Apple" people gave it. For the price, this phone is unbeatable. Quit hesitating, don't get the LG Volt, get this phone and you will not be disappointed.
Performs great!  I love the big screen and the sound quality.
*in a way,likely the best virgin mobile phone.no,feature wise it's not quite my galaxy s3(by any stretch)-but it does have size over the s3,which is a definite plus.battery far excels the galaxy&the; settings inclusive dual battery/&extreme; battery save options certainly come in handy during travel time without charger.price:@$180on Amazon last time I checked,need I say more?again,perhaps the best virgin phone(ie,bang4buck wise)hence,5star rating*
The 816 is replacing a Galaxy 3 because the Galaxy lasted 3 years and was draining batteries like crazy. The HTC is bigger and runs smooth with little battery use. I am still getting used to it and learning the HTC system. The only drawback I have had so far is the Galaxy used to allow me to customize the text messages so I could tell my Boss from my GF and unfortunately the 816 does not offer this customization.<br/>Overall it is a get phone.
Just received this phone as a replacement for a two year old iPhone 5. The first thing I noticed is how sharp the graphics are. As expected it will take some getting used to Android again but I actually prefer it to iOS. I haven't had much time to play with it since I've only had it 24 hours. I will update this review after I've had time to learn it. One question I already have is if this phone can be paired to the Hondalink on my 2014 Accord?<br/>Edit: once I had time to play around with it pairing it to the Hondalink was easy peasy. Just make sure Bluetooth is on and Hondalink will take it from there.
Beautiful screen on the Phablet. Just get rid of the bloatware it comes with. Added a memory card because it only comes with 8 gbs. I suggest a screen protector and a case. The phone is very slippery, but the finish if fantastic. Battery life is very good, even with heavy use. Only annoying issue is when I take it off charge it doesn't automatically light up and the buttons on the side are not as responsive as other phones i've had before.
AMAZING PHONE!! except for the preloaded virgin mobile apps
I love this phone best I ever had so far from virgin mobile
This phone has lasted me for over a year and has maintained it's speed and responsiveness.  It even got the lollipop upgrade after which everything worked perfect.<br/><br/>The battery life is fantastic and hasn't gone down much over my year of ownership.<br/><br/>Iv'e dropped it a number of times and it only got a couple minor scrapes and scratches.  The screen is still perfect and great for reading articles and responding to emails.
This Phone May be an older Model. However I love it more then the Galaxy Note 4 or the S5 even the iPhone 6 plus. It's everything I need and want. Great screen. Very clear and vivid. Excellent sound quality. Performance is very fast. However the limited 8GB's kinda sucks even though I bought a 32 GB so that satisfies my Needs or space usage. Overall a must buy for Cell Phone Gamers. For the price this phone has it all and then some.
The battery life is terrible, and i wish it was removable
Switched from a Galaxy 2 to this HTC. I've only had it a couple of weeks but it has been such a difference. Surprising strong battery for a phone with such a large screen. Transferring all my stuff from my previous phone was a snap with the HTC transfer. Loving my phone, can't recommended it enough. Does not come with a memory card, so switch yours over or buy one ahead of time because it has very little storage on it's own.
If you want a nice large screen and fair performance, this phone is a good buy. It works well and is sturdy for the price. It runs lollipop nicely. Only complaints I have are 1, the camera isn't that great, it has a tendency to wash out pics in bright sunlight, and 2, the antenna must be a little weak, as this phone shows less signal than what it replaced, a Samsung victory. And, of course, Virgin Mobile's limited network
Best phone for the money period. Processor is quick, screen is beautiful and the over all design is good. The only area where you can see this is not a flag ship phone is the material of the back cover. In only the time it took to place the screen protector on the front, the back already had obvious scratches from laying it on the bathroom counter. I can deal with using a case because all other areas of this are awesome.
I love my Desire 816. It's fast, with plenty of internal storage, the cameras work great, and the screen is beautiful. I like HTCs enhancements to Android, including the HTC Sense content aggregator. The screen is bright, and the huge 'phablet' size of the phone makes it a joy for consuming internet content and playing casual games. The phone has been very reliable, with only occasional needs for restarting.
I've had it for several months and no issues. It took awhile to get used to the size, but now when I use other people's "regular" sized phones I feel like Jack and the bean stalk, they look so small now. Battery life could be better, but I will use this until it dies completely before getting a different phone. Also, using it as a gps on my dash is amazing, the size really helps seeing small roads
I've had it for about 6 months and no issues. Love it!
I am super happy with this phone. So far. I may change my mind as I have it longer. My only "complaint" is that I definitely had to get used to the size. But once I did, I prefer it. I can use it as a mini tablet almost while I'm holding mydaughter --especially when skyping! The camera is fabulous, I can use many different qualities in order to use for messaging or prints. It has a good speed.
When I received the phone  display screen was broken.
This phone rocks! Hands down 1 of the best smart phones out there. All the bells and whistles of the ridiculously expensive options (not that there is anything wrong with that) without the price tag. I would've preferred a different carrier but I haven't been disappointed with Virgin so far. Love, love this phone. If you are considering getting this, trust me, you won't regret it. Get it already!
Great phone! Picture quality is amazing for front and back camera, fast android processor, it never lags or freezes, has awesome WiFi connection, and the dual sound speakers are really cool. Only complaint I have is that it's a little big, but the phone itself makes up for the size and even with my case its not bigger than an iPhone 6 Plus. I love this phone and I would  reccomend it to anyone!
Was looking for a cheap replacement for the Galaxy S2. This has been a great phone so far. The size of the phone is a little surprising at first but after a couple of days you get used to it. Seems like it will handle everything I need it to. A little disapointed in the amount of space taken up by useless preloaded aps also the battery life is not the greatest full charge lasts about 18hrs.
Great purchase! Very impressed. Arrived on schedule!
Nice big screen not a lot of features buh I do like.
This has a beautiful display, and such, but I have returned one already because it keeps saying " SD card unexpectedly removed"  I didn't remove it, it was just sitting on the table, then it of course removes all the pictures, and ringtones, etc.  and I have to keep resetting everything.  Got the second phone...it's doing the same exact thing ~~will save up for something better ...
Bought this for my daughter and she loves it!  The screen is huge!! I'm starting to rethink my Galaxy S5 upgrade and might buy this instead. She plays games on it and it hasn't overheated. The battery hasn't had a problem but it's only been a week. I can't pry this phone from her fingers.<br/>She said the internet is pretty zippy and the apps work great.<br/>Has a front and back camera.
This phone is great. Until you drop it. Phone screen gets all glitchy and makes it look like you have double vision. I fixed it by tapping it in some miraculously helpful way... But then I keep dropping it and have to keep finding just the right tap to fix it. I have a small glitch in the top left corner but it's not too bad. My old phone could handle a fall like a champ.... I miss it.
I love this phone!  The only issue is not enough memory.  But that is an issue with many phones. It is loaded with a lot of system files (apps) and I often find myself deleting apps, but overall I am pleased.  The call quality is pretty good and the battery life is way better than my old phone.  So the phone does everything I need it to do and more.  I am very happy with my purchase.
I needed a newer phone for Bluetooth 4.0 and this was priced right. My previous phone was an EVO 3d, so this was a step up in size as well as specs. The increased size makes this a little bulkier, but it makes up for that shortcoming with it's increased speed and larger screen. My one complaint is I seem to have gotten one that won't update. I've tried almost a dozen times so far.
An average nice phone with lots that surprised me.
When it was delivered to my address, i didn't expect for this phone to be huge! I knew it was a 5.5 in screen but it blew my expectations<br/>! so far i have no problems with it and enjoy it very much.<br/>The only thing i dislike is the back, its very cheap plastic that scratches very easy if its put down flat on a hard surface, i would recommend to buy a case to go with.
I absolutely love this phone, I upgraded from the S3 and so far this phone does everything that I need it to do. Don't get me wrong I love my Samsung, but it was old and the screen was shattered and if I could have afforded it I would have got the new Samsung I wanted, but this phone was much more affordable, and I am NOT disappointed with my decision to buy this phone!
Phone is as expected from all the reviews I read.
Awesome only drawback is battery is not removable
This is honestly the best phone I have had! The screen is beautiful, the sound is amazing, battery life is great, and I actually love the size. So many people have commented on the phone and found it to be interesting. Virgin Mobile has been well also--no difference in service. Definitely a great choice for folks looking to get off contract and use a high-end phablet!
This is a really good phone. For a no contract phone, we couldn't ask more for the price. It updated to Android Lollipop right out of the box. It's not going to replace a tablet but a phone should have to. It takes point and shoot quality photos. While it would be too big for me (a guy) to carry in my pocket but is fine for my wife to carry in her purse. Recommended.
Great phone !! If you want a big phone, this is it just as big as a Note 2 with a better design. Speakers, camera, and speed is also great. Only thing is you may want to invest in a phone case because fingerprints on the back of the phone are noticeable and almost look like smudges. GREAT BUY especially when virgin mobile is selling exact phone for a extra 100 bucks.
I'm enjoying this purchase with a smile!! No matter what other's have said about this phone. I find it to have all the updated technology I need and the screen is far bigger & better than some of those phones on the market that cost an arm and leg. Don't count the HTC DESIRE 816....out! This reasonable cell phone has what it takes for your everyday usage and more!
Pros- very beautiful screen , 4glte,720hd for movies or YouTube ,both camera,dual front speakers with boom sound,fit nice on the hand ,very decent processor with snapdragon 400 with adreno 304 graphic,can hold up too 128gb sd card.and very well made.<br/>Cons- low internal 8gb only 3.6 is available and charging port seem too be loosely while charging the phone.
Nice nice great fine add a protector case and its not going to slip off your hand very nice display my wife loves it I bought it for her..I can't stand the i phone hype this done performs nicely with out paying hundreds more for a name and its fast enough your not waiting for loading nice operating system very stable and good battery life htc did a great job
Very good phone. You need an sd card  for more memory for pictures/movies. This is not a good option if you install lots of apps/games as you only have like 3 GB available for that; some apps even though you can in principle move to sd card will still use some of the internal 3GB.<br/>For me though this is not the case so the phone is perfect. Large screen;
Got a 62 GB card and it's no help because most apps can't move to SD card.  So, due to maybe one or 2 GB usable for apps, your maxed out with Android 4.4 from the start.  And of course virgin and Google have a lot of preloaded apps none of which you can't move to extra storage, pictures ...almost nothing.<br/>dissapointing, have 61 gb left open yet no room.
I have had this phone for 7/8mths now. And it still works like it did when I tookn out the box. Front facing speakers are amazing. Speakers and ver clear, had bass, and are very loud. Back camera takes awesome pics and video's. No lag...doesn't freeze! I do wish it had more memory but that is basically the only negative thing I have to say about the phone.
Amazing phone one of the best phones virgin mobile has and the best of all is the boomsound speakers not to mention the huge 5.5 screen which is amazing for watching videos and playing games. Also the battery life is pretty good lasts me for at least a good full day without charging it.
I love  this phone, especially since Virgin Mobile is always sold out of the higher end phones online.  Pictures are beautiful, even has an editing feature to remove blemishes.  Phone is fast and doesn't shut down my Maps when my Amazon music is playing.  Works like a charm.  Just know that you will NEED a memory card if you want more than a few big apps.
As big as the galaxy note 4 and great processor
Great phone.  It's big but thin so it really doesn't feel much more bulky than my old Samsung Galaxy S3.  It's speedy and works well.  I was a little concerned about not having a removable battery but battery life is great.  We'll see how than pans out over the long run though.  I just wish there were more accessories out there for it.  Cases and such.
Love love love this phone!!! I had a Samsung galaxy s3 before this and did not want to pay $600 to upgrade to the next one. Two things better than the galaxy, the screen on this is very large but not to big & awesome camera. One downside, the battery is not as good, it took me some time to get used to charging it more often. Overall very happy with it
I love this phone!!<br/><br/>Best deal out there for the price they offer this phone!<br/><br/>If i were you i would go ahead and get the phone it will not let you down!! It is very powerful little device!!<br/><br/>I also went and bought a memory card for the phone that works awesome!! http://amzn.to/1KDeW1b  I got it here on amazon as well!!
Super excited to have this prepaid htc desire 816 phone. I love the size and i just received it. It came sooner than the expected date. It's brand new, wasn't opened at all or damaged. I love virgin mobile. You choose what plan you'd like and everything is unlimited!!!! :)
Very happy with this phone.  Very happy with battery life.  Previously had an HTC evo and the battery life was terrible from the beginning and only got worse so this is quite nice to have a phone that can go 36 hours on a charge.  Its bigger than my friends Samsung galaxy S5.  The size took a little while to get used to, but now I love it!
I upgraded my wife's phone from a Samsung Galaxy Mini (that couldn't stay on!!!!) to this little gem. It has enough RAM and Memory space for what she needs, she loves the new camera and is on her new phone a lot LESS, because she can actually do all her "things" and spend more time with me!<br/><br/>Fast, Great and Amazing phone!
SIM card mechanism malfunctioned after only a couple months of light use. Never touched the SIM slot, but now it will not lock in place so I cannot receive 4G LTE data. And as a result of the locking failure, the slot cover will not stay closed completely.<br/><br/>Aside from this decent-sized inconvenience, the phone is a great device.
With any new phone, it takes time to familiarize yourself with the environment.  But, it all came together and I am loving the features.  I love the size of this phone too; much bigger than my last phone.  My service with Virgin mobile is affordable and I receive service in areas I never used to with my other phone.  Happy customer here.
Awesome phone , battery dies kind of quickly
Love this phone works like a $500 dollar one
Bought this phone for my daughter for Christmas. Wow! What a great screen. It's huge compared to my iPhone 4s. It's also blazing fast. Apps open immediately without any perceivable lag. Were I not so immersed in the whole "Apple ecosystem," I would buy one for myself. For the price, I don't think you can get a better phone.
Really glad I found this phone.  I had 3 different Samsungs over the years (including the Galaxy III) and they all fell apart within 9 to 12 months.  This phone has been super durable with great battery life.  I am a fan of HTC's and will continue buying them.  Nothing better than finding a product at a good price that lasts long.
Good enough for those who are smart enough to keep up with technology, but not too much for those who aren't in the loop. Fast response, good volume and call quality. Have to restart maybe once a week but no problem even with that. Have bought replacement due to being run over (!!!!!), but that wasn't the fault of the phone. :)
It was a gift for my husband.  He loves it! He's not a big on keeping up with the latest gadgets, so this phone to him was like getting the latest and greatest.  So, I am happy I made the right choice for him.  The pics come out clear and he has had virgin mobile network for YEARS.  He is happy with the service they provide.
Nice big screen, pretty fast, fairly good battery life. Only issue is it is so thin it is hard to hold on to. I would prefer a little more thickness as a bigger battery. Also having all the buttons in a row means accidentally turning the screen off when I mean to turn the volume up. Sense lacking a message widget stinks too.
HTC has a glitch where you put in an aixillary cord. It constantly brings up Google talk. I can't listen to Pandora. This phone also won't let you delete frequently contacted people in texting. It runs nice. I'd recommend it. However I cry a little every time I get in the car and can't plug my phone in to listen to Pandora.
Thought this phone was a praised a little too much for why I expirienced, but overall a great phone. Camera 4/5 (excessive editing features that yet lacks a few basic ones such as photo brightness) speed 3/5 (only used for 2 weeks) screen 5/5, OS 4/5 ( LACKS ABILITY TO USE TWO APPS AT ONCE! huge letback for a large phone !
I've had this phone for a month now and I've dropped it a number of times. I have yet to have a problem with it, and I'm horrible with phones.I love the front speakers, and the camera is awesome. I know a lot of people keeps talking about the battery life, but I installed a battery saving app and my battery lasts all day.
I love this phone. The only things I have a problem with, having come from the ease of a Samsung is the notification tone sounds when you're on the phone so you get a super loud tone in your ear.  And it's almost impossible...or I haven't found out how...to post a photo from your gallery to Facebook.  I love the size.
I love this phone. Although I didn't expect it's size, which is larger than the galaxy x5, I still love it. People try to judge the size of my phone but the phone is still awesome. I highly recommend this phone. Remember phone is big. . But think big phone = large screen for selfies, gaming, watching movies and etc.
Great price it's about $100 cheaper than Radio Shack and Virgin Mobiles own web site. The Phone is a lot faster than my current HTC EVO 3d phone with a lot more internal memory though it comes with 8 gigabtyes only about three is usable to the user since bloat ware and operating system utilizing most of the memory.
Very good choice for a phone, even with 2015 standards! This is a great phone for the new android user, or even someone looking for a small upgrade. The only downside is the 8GB of storage runs out extremely quick, so make sure you get an SD Card to expand that! It performs quite well for only having 1.5GB of ram!
I bought this to replace a casio gz commando and a nokia lumia 510. It was worth it completely. This phone is fun and fast and cool in every way possible for android usages. Good for video viewing and photography and gaming. Good software and apps but phone storage is crap mine is almost full 8gb not enough room.
good big honken tonk phone. yeeeehhaaaaw!
Phone is top of the line for a good price
There are many pros too this phone. Awesome 720P screen. Truly there are very few cons with this phone but there is one major con. The on board phone storage is very minimal but easy too work with. Overall great phone and it was a steal for $199
I love everything about this phone except the placement of the SIM card. If you put your phone in your back pocket, it will eventually pop out and not want to stay in that side slot it's in for some reason. I have it in a case, and I still have trouble keeping the SIM where it should be. This phone is HUGE!
One of the best phones i have ever owned. Screen is very bright and has vivid colors, battery life is fine for how much i use it (I can almost always make it all day on a single charge), only downfall is it doesn't fit in my pocket very well. I've also owned a iPhone 5c and this phone is a much better deal.
I have zero complaints about this phone.
I'm writing this after owning these for a little over 2 months. Great phone. Shipping was quick, and the activation/transfer from my previous Virgin Mobile HTC was seamless. Camera is satisfactory for Instagram, and the sound coming from the speakers is exceptional, and the large display is quite crisp.
I've gone through so many Android phones at VM and this one is the best one yet. The camera has lots of features and the screen is HUGE. I recommend buying a micro sd card. Battery life lasts about 8 hours with continuous use (IG, Twitter, Games, Emails) but on standby the battery could last a full day.
Everything about this phone is great , expect when I put it on the charger it tends to heat up and over heat at times.  But I've learned to work with it.  It's very big and I get compliments on it all the time . Love this phone  :  ) I would recommend buying screen protectors  . Scratches very easily  .
Really love this phone. The battery lasts a really long time and it is easy to set up and use. It does need to be turned off/restarted every now and again to stop it from getting glitchy but other than that I have no complaints. I have had this phone for months now and I will never go back to Samsung!
Nice phone for the price.  The phone works well and seems like a solid phone for the price.  All accessories included with the phone works well.  The price on Amazon is cheaper than what the Virgin Mobile website offers the exact same phone for.  I would recommend this phone to my family and friends.
Daughter was very happy with this phone
Nice phone for the price. Only con is the small internal storage. Apps and operating system take up most of the room. Not a deal breaker though. I imagine you could store apps on an external storage chip to avoid this problem. Would recommend if you are trying to get the most phone for your buck.
A very solid Virgin Mobile phone, at a very competitive price.I won't say its the best phone available, but it will be about a quarter or less expensive than the Iphone 6 or a Galaxy 5/6. Impressively good audio, and a very fast processor. Just make sure you get a good deal of external storage.
This phone is awesome!!!!  It is humongous and it's crystal clear!!  I love the sound boom and the fact that it has not just one but two eco battery saving settings!! I would recommend this phone to anyone. And the camera is unbelievable!  This phone has tons of bells and whistles. I LOVE IT!!!
This is a review of the phone itself. Not virgin mobile service, thereforeI will not be going into network service<br/><br/>Overall it is a decent phone. It has one MAJOR flaw though.<br/><br/>The big CON<br/>Internal Memory - This device only has 8gbs of internal memory. Yes I am being serious. That is barely enough for system resources, let alone additional apps, photos, music, etc. Seriously even before the Android 5.0 lollipop update I noticed this problem. What is annoying is that this phone comes stock with quite a few apps. These apps take up a lot of the 8gb of space. Most of them are useless. For whatever reason you can not uninstall them or completely move them to your SD card (which i do have..you NEED one with this phone). Because of this issue I have only been able to download only a few apps, only the essentials such as uber, skype. Many times some of my apps cant even update because there isn't just enough space. It is extremely frustrating. And with the impending new android updates, this is only going to get worse.<br/><br/>One other thing i found annoying was that there is no removable battery.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>720p screen and a large screen. - I hate phones with high resolution but the screen is too small to even enjoy. This is not the case.<br/>Speakers - Amazing sound. Hands down best speaker quality in any phone i have seen in years.<br/>Affordable - Less than $200. No complaints here.<br/>Camera - Megapixels on the front back camera are great.<br/>Battery life - as of now with powersaver enabled the phone lasts all day with average use.<br/><br/>Last note<br/><br/>??Processor?? - So this can either be a pro or con depending on how your perspective. The phone has a weaker processor than the average current smart phone. This was done to reduce price. The only time I notice a delay or lag is with taking pictures. I have not seen this with any other app.
Wow. First of all let me tell you how amazing this device is. For the price it's incredibly quick, the camera is amazing, and the audio....just wow. Now as for the shipping it was a little confusing at first but was very responsive and fast. I would definitely recommend this device to anyone.
A little big but it's as good as any phone I've had. Coming from galaxy victory and HTC evo 3D. I am really happy about every aspect of this phone and for under $200 it is totally worth it. Just know it is big if you don't want a big phone almost tablet don't get it. Otherwise can't beat it.
Its a great phone and the size is awesome im able to injoy watching Crunchyroll, Hulu, YouTube, and other streaming apps in great resolution.Im also able to injoy gaming now. My old phone suck't it will crash or was incapable of playing most new games. For most im satasfied with my purchase.
Works as advertised. Shipping was fast
i love this phone,its a great mid-level phone,its fast ,has a nice big screen...and very nice,speakers are really good for cell phone speakers,i wish the battery life on it was a little better but still decent,i got it for 179.99 and at that price thats a STEAL,i highly recommend this phone
I just received this phone yesterday an it is awesome. I had other virgin mobile phones an the htc 816 blows all the other virgin mobile phone outta the water lol if anything  ppl should buy this phone trust me you will like it it's a perfect size I like big phone get this phone trust me :)
Love the phone but Kit Kat operating system will not allow you to access the external sd card. Phone only has 4GB of internal storage after all the junk apps built in, and they hype it up saying you can add up to 128GB with micro memory card. They just don't tell you, you can't access it!
Awesome looking phone, but poorly made. Best feature are the speakers. Biggest problem I have is the constant sd card dismounting, will randomly dismount, very annoying, has ugly plastic back that's crazy on finger prints, low storage, flimsy, feels like it will snap, so don't sit on it.
The seller promised the phone would be delivered by 8pm on Friday 6/5,  I rec'd it much earlier in the day.  The phone so far is great.  Still getting everything set up on it.  I bought this phone based on a recommendation from my sister and after reading all the great reviews on Amazon.
Great phone so far. I love the size of the screen. Also the speakers are awesome. Very loud. I am just worried about the battery being embedded because if there is an issue with it you have to replace the whole phone. Hopefully HTC will understand this and replace them for us consumers.
It was my birthday gift to mussel reviewed others online way more pricey. Bit assn I glad I chose and got this phone love love love it. Great large screen battery life. Quick and easy change from one Virgin cell to another. Kept plan and number of course.  Very happy with my purchase m
Awesome phone. Very good volume when it comes to playing music or talking on the phone. Charges pretty fast for a big phone. I love it. The screen size is big enough. Not too big but big enough to watch TV and shows on so its perfect. Def recommend to anyone. And the price is awesome.
Awesome phone! Much more affordable alternative to some of the major flagship phones out there. The processor is very fast compared to my S2, the 5.5" is great, and the battery is the best I've ever used. Was hesitant at first to buy this phone, but now I don't regret it at all.
Big screen, quick, great price. Good sound from the speakers, I listen to a lot of podcasts while I cook and I can hear them perfectly. The only problem I've had is lack of space on the internal drive. Had to manually move over a lot of stuff to a sd card. Overall, love the phone.
Upgraded from a previous HTC Desire phone. I love the larger screen, better camera, much faster operating system. Great battery life, I can be away from a charger all day without worry, I had to carry a battery pack charger for my previous phone. I would recommend this to a friend
Not much to say about this one. IT’S A GREAT PHONE!!; no complaints so far considering the price. It’s the best phone option out there for Virgin Mobile. This phone easily can compete with the $500s price range phones from the less affordable carriers. Thanks Virgin Mobile & HTC.
I could rave about this thing. It's huge, yes, and it'll take a bit of getting used to... But now everyone else's phone feels like a tiny cheap toy in comparison.  Awesome picture and phenomenal sound, great for Netflix! Decent battery unless you're on it every minute of the day.
Amazing phone!! I upgrated 1 week ago and fell in love with this phone. It's super fast, great battery life, love BoomSound, 13 mgp camera is awesome. Everything I wanted. 4g is way faster then my old 3g phone was... great design and big screen. I'm super happy with this phone...
LOVE THE H T C DESIRE  EASIEST PHONE I EVER OWNED<br/>BIG SCREEN  BRIGHT PICTURES  13 MEGAPIXLE CAMERA<br/>  THE NOTIFICATION SOUNDS  NEED TO BE BETTER<br/>NOT A VERY GOOD CHOICE  RINGTONE IS WHATEVER YOU<br/>MAKE IT  OVERALL  VERY GOOD PHONE  DOM RUSSO<br/>5.5 INCH SCREEN
Item is very good and as described..
I am seriously obsessed with my new phone!!!!!! the only thing my mom and i both have an issue with is memory. she bought a 68gb card and still is having issues with low memory. 7 of the 8gigs are used right away. :( if anyone knows why this is happening please let me know.
Got this for my boyfriend for his birthday. He absolutely loves it. The camera is great, the features are just what he was looking for. Easy to navigate. The only thing he doesn't like is the size but if you want abig phone this is the phone for you. I think it is perfect.
I absolutely love this phone. I was very skeptical about purchasing being that it's a mid range phone . Having the HTC one previously I am very  impressed with the phones speed camera screen size brightness etc. I'm happy that I purchased this device u should do the same !
Great phone it looks, feels and performs like a high end smartphone with tons of features and it has a huge screen witch I like but the battery is not that great I barely used it all today I woke up at 6am and pulled it off the charger but it only lasted me till about 5pm
I cannot express how impressed I am with this phone. I've been using it for some months now and it has never, once, locked up on me or needed any kind of tech support/troubleshooting. It is well made and dependable and has great features. The best phone I've ever owned.
I bought it around one year. The sound is good and the resolution is nothing to complain. However, I don't know why my facebook app can run in this phone even though i downloaded the new version of this app. Now i have to use the lite facebook app, not like it at all.
I love my new phone the HTC Desire 816 is amazing! It came quickly, its beautiful, sound quality is great, picture quality is great, everything about it is great! Transferring information from my other phone was easy, and i've had no problems. I recommend it to anyone
The phone is really nice.  The Boom sound is a little disappointing as I cannot tell a difference between these speakers and the sound on other cell phone.  If the Boom sound is your selling point you may want to look at other phones... The camera is really excellent.
I love  this phone and I'm really happy I ended up buying it. Especially for the price it's a steal. it's a large phone which will lead to the "Its a brick" and "where's your tablet" jokes but I personally got use to the size and don't mind it at all.
Love it! It's a replacement for an iphone 5. Yes, it's an upgrade! I guess it's the best product at this price! Well made, big and clear screen, good sound. The only con is the camera, which is not so good as most people said, maybe because i compared it with my SLR.
What an amazing phone!  I can use this phone extensively for 4 full days before needing a charge.  This includes calls, texting, web browsing, downloading from Google Play and everything else.  You better jump on this deal before Amazon realizes it is under priced.
I've had this phone for about a week and it's great. Huge screen! It is a bit heavy but worth it for the big screen. Only issue is the in-call sound can be a little tinny and hard to hear. But hey, who gets a phone to make calls? :) Overall happy with this phone.
Great phone! Couldn't be happier! I'm not sure why this phone is not more popular and/or carried on more US carriers. Sure, it's not "top of the line" or "cutting edge" but for the price and HTCs build quality, you can't go wrong with this phone!
I bought this phone for my wife to replace her worn out HTC Evo 4g.  She loves it.  The screen is HUGE!  Speakers are loud and phone call quality is great.  I added a 64gb micro SD card and used the HTC transfer app to move everything over from her old phone.
I have had this phone for a few months now and it is Awesome to say the least. I'm a big man, and the screen size is great. The down side is the battery, but it mostly my fault for not keeping it charged properly. Thinking about getting on for my girlfriend.
so far its a great phone..,13 mp camera, less than 200 dollars...looks just like i phone 6 plus...even the battery is great...only negative i will say is its a htc and who know how long it will work right, Ive own other htc that start to get buggy after time
Okay, so far - so amazing.<br/>I had the LG Volt for a little while. That phone was pretty great too, but this is the ultimate experience! Huge screen, reminds me of the Note 2. Fast, great display and many more wonderful details. This is worth the money.
Yes it has bloatware, yes 8gb is a little low on the storage side. The screen is great for the $. Hard to beat VM pricing. Front speakers, no brainer, should have been standard from day one. Battery lasts all day. For the price this phone is hard to beat.
Excellent price, excellent phone.
excellent. a steal for the price.
This phone is awesome! I feel like I bought a $600 phone. I came from a iPhone 4s and this phone was a great upgrade. The operating system I have to get used to but overall it's great. The screen size is huge, much like the galaxy note series. Great buy!
Bought this for my husband, his first smart phone.  He likes it so far, still learning all the ins and outs.  I'm used to Apple devices.  The screen is large and easier for him to use than my iPhone5.  Using Virgin Mobile service and am happy with them.
Wonderful phone for the price. Great camera, large screen, long battery life. Upgraded to this after Samsung S3. Such a better phone than Samsung S3, imo. Only issue is the storage space. Will need to buy an SD card as phone does not have enough space.
this is a phone is great I really love it  the look is even better and the battery life is really good !!!! my favorite part tho is the speakers they are actually loud lol if you are considering buying this phone I highly recommend that you get it !!!!
It's larger than I expected but definitely runs faster than my old phone (galaxy S2).  The only complaint I have is the SIM card no longer stays in its slot.  It took about 2 weeks and the holder for the SIM card stopped holding the SIM card in place.
My ordered arrived in two days. This phone is huge. I have to hold with both hands. After having a Samsung galaxy s2,3,4. I must say I'm impressed. This speaker is so loud! Only I dislike is my screenshot and my different settings from Samsung galaxy.
Phones work well overall. Not much memory. The SIM card slot wears out very easy. I maybe taken SIM out once or twice and and always been in case. My phone is in perfect condition. Other than SIM slot doesn't hold card anymore Making phone useless.
Very amazing phone! Probably won't like it if you have small hands though!<br/>Side Note: Some people are concerned with battery life, although it is smaller than I anticipated, it could easily be resolved with and external battery charger.
The 5 stars are reflective of the stellar service and probably a 3.75 on cellular product.  HTC 816 is fantastic  starter to mid level product ... You might lean towards a definitive better phone. For 200.00 more. But for my needs. Its great
I absolutely love this phone!  Very loud which was one of my biggest complaints about other phones I have owned.  I love that the speakers are on the front, just seems logical for obvious reasons.  Big, bright screen, super smooth scrolling.
Awesome phone. BIG screen. I had to get used to how big the phone is at first, but I LOVE it. So easy to see everything and the sound is great. Don't get this if you want something that will easily fit in skinny jean pockets. Decent camera.
Pleased with this product. In fact had a desire 510 but now gave it to my fiance. Phone exceeds expectations and price was great. Being a previous HTC one owner and galaxy s3 I was nervous about this one but gotta say best piece I've owned.
I bought this phone in November of 2014, hoping that this would be the answer to my wishes (being able to keep all of my apps as further updates would surely follow the purchase).  Unfortunately, my wishes were smashed to bits. Let me preface by saying that I don't know how to nor do I ROOT phones. I have purchased several so-called 8GB internal memory phones only to find out that there isn't enough room to update the apps.<br/><br/>And YES, I did experiment with moving (a percentage of ) apps to my added on mini SD card. Like every other phone, you can't really add the "app" to the SD card, but rather what you use for that app (photos, music, book prefs). I did all I could to avoid updating bloat apps (HTC, GOOGLE, etc.) to no avail. Before the last update that I put off for over a week, I went from 0.63 GB of free space to 0.37 GB of free space. That means that I can't update any blessed apps that I want to, like AMAZON, KINDLE, AVAST, SKYPE without either moving something to the card or removing app(s).<br/><br/>It would appear that I'm not shooting high enough. Perhaps I need more memory, like what galaxy phones allegedly have. Problem is, I don't want a contract and can't afford the S6. That leaves older phones with older batteries because they are no longer made. Most of which won't allow you to remove the battery to replace that.<br/><br/>I just can't win.
Loved the phone but it wouldn't connect with mobile data network when wifi unavailable. Great features at a fair price. Without internet connection, I had to return it. Great return service and refund handled expertly and promptly. Thanks!
This phone works very smoothly and has very good reception. I have had no problems with battery life, it usually lasts the entire day and goes down to 40%. However, I have to say I always have it on energy save and recharge it every night.
Something is defenetly wrong in the phone information in options it says HTC 710 not 816 and when theres always an update cant update says Smith is disabled anybody else having the same problems but nice phone sound is Great and i love it
Bought this for my dad who has never had a smartphone (or any kind of phone). He appreciates the large screen, and knows more about the workings of his phone than I do now. I have the same one, and he asked for this after seeing mine.
Just got it today and it's great so far. Activation is a little bit goofy with Virgin Mobile. It activates with the phone and then you have to activate it all over again with Virgin. But all in all it seems pretty nice for the price.
Phone is perfect for calls,texting and internet. Camera isn't as good as even my iPhone 4s but at the price for the screen size,I cant Complain. It does feel a little fragile. Feels like I could probably snap it in two with my hands.
I was able to get the phone I wanted without breaking the bank. Really enjoy the 5.5 display, great for watching videos, movies, etc. The only issue is that the phone comes with preloaded apps that takes up space. Still worth it 👍.
I usually don't write reviews or whatever but this phone is phenomenal I bought one the my family went crazy over it and we bought like 3 more from shopcelldeals thank you! P.s. might wanna buy a microsd card just to be comfortable
Right size for me. It's fast. Love the on-screen buttons. Battery on stand by is excellent, but something disappointing is when you watch YouTube and browse social media the battery goes by quickly. Any who, love it, recommend it.
Wanted a upgrade to my old HTC. This didn't disappoint and I am glad I did! Very large screen, easy to transfer all my info to this phone. Boom sound type speakers mean I don't need an extra device to listen to my tunes! Love it!
Phone was bought for my husband who has Virgin mobile service. He could not get it set up with his info, called Virgin mobile and they said the phone was not programmed for their service.<br/>They reprogrammed and it works fine.
I haven't had any issues with this phone. I installed a 32GB sd card. It works fine. It does come with A LOT of installed apps. U don't get much room left of that 8GB ram. But all android phones have that issue thanks to Google.
I received my phone a day earlier two weeks ago. Was impressed by the size of the phone from the first site after opening the box. The HTC transfer tool is a must and very esy to use when getting information from your old phone.
LOVE! LOVE! LOVE this phone! I especially love the camera! I bought a 64 GB memory card and I'm good to go. The sound is crystal clear and I receive text messages quickly. This is my first smart phone and I couldn't be happier.
The phone works and looks amazing. Honestly the battery has been able to last me ALL day with no lagging ! The only con is it says invalid SIM card and it's very confusing. Hoping virgin mobile can answer this question for me!
I'm loving this phone, fantastic camera, wonderful speed and responsiveness.. it's too big for one of my purses, and the speakers aren't quite as good as the ones on the HTC One, but other than that, amazing!  Fantastic value!
Very good phone. Great screen, battery and speed. I sold it because te screen was a little too big for my taste but if you're looking for a great phablet at a great price, look no further. Plus can't beat virgin mobile pricing
The battery life is not good.
Great phone. Love the camera.
Very pleased with everything!
Beautiful phone. Just love it
The 816 is a great phone. It is really big, but it only took me a day to get used to it and I have small hands. Once you are used to this beast you will have a hard time using other peoples average size phones. Trust me. haha
HTC Desire 816 Black (Virgin mobile) nice phone i would have giving it a 5 stars but u can not take out the battery.The battery life is great i can get 10 episodes of walking dead and still have 20% left plus it has lollipop
I might be the unlucky one: got this phone for few weeks, (1) the battery drained crazily (from 87% down to 7% in couple house at idle mode and extreme power saving mode on). (2) GPS signal has been never detected. We kept trying to use it while driving from Jacksonville, FL to Lake Park/ Valdosta, GA. The GPS kept locating and ended up "GPS signal lost". (3) The led light has never been on even I set notification light on. (4) Don't know what "Smith expired" (hardware bug) is. It keeps popping up every time I restarted the phone. (5) The newest Android 4.4 system does has constraint - there is no built-in file/ folder explorer. Even you download one from google play, you still can't make change/ delete any files from the external SD card. I don't get it why they did that.<br/><br/>I, however, didn't hear much people (who gave positive feedback) that battery drain and GPS were problems. So I gave it a try and sent it back to Amazon for a replacement. Hoping it will be better when I get the 2nd one. I do like the big screen (5.5") for 40 something like me but don't want to put on the reading glasses. The resolution of the camera is very good and stable especially HD features, I don't need the flashlight on (at night) but am still able take some good pictures.
I love this phone! It is great, it's fast and easy to use. It is very big in screen size so it makes it perfect to play games or watch movies on. :D I just got a memory card for more space, but it's not bad on space either.
it was really good I came out with a stuff that I expected to be NFL Films great the perfect phone for my big hands since I am about six foot five man so it is perfect for my hands and its pretty big which is perfect<br/>.
Ive had it for a week now this phone is king great display great speakers the cameras are legit the build quality is boss the battery is good not great  the htc ui needs no 3rd party launchers .. overall its a great device
Good phone and value for 179.00. Virgin has limited reception around where I live in the Berkshires - not as good as ATT.<br/>Recurring annoying phone updates and services that you can't get rid of as far as I can tell.
Came in its original packaging and so much better that the HTC desire 601 I had before. Even my sister who is an iPhone 5s owner loves using my phone instead. The boom speakers make every day chores a little less boring.
THIS PHONE WILL NOT UNLOCK. IT WILL NOT WORK ON GSM. this is a great phone but it wont take a sim card even though there is a slot for one. Be warned!!!! The phone itself is a very nice phone but its cheap for a reason.
There is nothing I can say bad about this phone. I been with Virgin Mobile for years. The 4g LTE is great. Be careful when taking pictures. It takes pictures like a high end camera, click after click.  Highly recommend.
Best phone I've had,  picks up where my tablet won't very good Wi-Fi. Big clear screen , movies look great. Speaker give the best sound. The only problem is the back cover, it is a fingerprint magnet so u need a cover.
I've had it for over 2 weeks now. The big screen is awesome. Such a difference from my previous phone. Yes, as others have said, of the 10 phones I've owned before, the sound is 10x better.<br/>Buy it, you'll like it!
So I bought this phone 7 months ago and I love it! The size is perfect for me even though I have small hands. I had dropped it many times accidentally  and I got lucky that the scream hasn't broke! Highly recommended!
COMING FROM IPHONE 3G, 4, 5S, TO A SAMSUNG SIII, THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST PHONE I HAVE OWNED.  AS EVERYONE HAS MENTIONED, I WOULD PREFER THE ON/OFF BUTTON BE PLACED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE BUT THAT IS A VERY MINOR GRIPE.
Love this phone...happy it's compatible with Virgin Mobile...I've been with Virgin Mobile over 10 years...added a sd card no problems. I am the most low tech person. Everyday I discover new features on this phone.
Nice phone for the price I paid.<br/>The only complaint is that the memory is very low and just upgrading the software takes way to much space you are somewhat limited to get apps other then that is a nice phone
Amazing phone! Glad I chose this phone. Great signal. Replies fast to touch. The music is amazing. Big screen. Coming off the Samsung galaxy 3 this is so much better. If I had to choose a phone this one would it.
My husband likes it a lot. He used to have the Galaxy S3, and though he misses a few features from the Samsung brand...The speaker quality<br/>(deep bass) makes up for it. So over all he is a satisfied customer.
The phone came in only two days and it's just as described. It's about the same size as the iPhone 6+ and has a lot of useful features. The rear-facing camera takes clear photos and works great outside. There's also a lot of options that allow you to adjust the camera settings. The front-facing camera was better than I expected; it took pretty good photos. The snapchat selfies are on point! The soundboom speakers are loud and clear with a little bit of bang; it sounds like it's coming from a bluetooth speaker. The screen is bright and vibrant and the phone's fast. The back of the phone is plastic and a tad bit slippery so I recommend getting a phone case. It says it comes with 8 gb of storage but only 4 of those 8 gb are available for use. You can easily buy a micro sd card to add more space if four isn't enough for you. The lock screen  button and volume rocker keys are on the same side and I sometimes find myself locking my phone screen when I'm trying to turn the volume up and vice versa. The lock screen button is also a little hard to reach since it's so high up but it's not too big of a deal. Overall, it's still a great phone  and I'd recommend it if you like large phones and taking quality photos
Originally bought one for the wife. After being fully impressed in the speed, picture quality and camera quality I ordered another one for my self. Slim and large screen also one of the big points of this phone.
It's a great phone for Virgin mobile. what puts it over the top is the excellent price. the device its self the battery is not as good as the iphone battery life but I do get over 10-12 hrs of use on one charge.
Large like a mini computer.
It's a great phone, problem for me is... It won't let me update to new lollipop. Seem I gotta do it manually. Best upgrade I made coming from LG volt. Love how responsive it is and battery life is fairly great.
I bought this to replace my Galaxy SIII. This was a little cheaper and I figured I'd try something new. Now, all-around it's not a bad phone. However, I wish I'd just gotten another SIII.<br/><br/>I'll knock my biggest pet peeve out of the way first. This thing is PACKED with bloatware and none of it can be uninstalled. Over half your memory will be thrown away because of it. This wouldn't be so bad if there was a micro-SD slot, but there isn't. So if storage is an issue for you, do yourself a favor and stop investigating this phone.<br/><br/>Next comes the OS. It's clunky sometimes and navigation can be weird. The HOME, WINDOWS, and CLOSE buttons are on the touchscreen, too. Not my preference either. However, I must applaud the auto correct and language recognition software. The suggested words often help me complete entire sentences much faster now.<br/><br/>It's fair enough in the hardware department. Screen is clean and the speakers are louder than my SIII's were. The camera is okay, but the autofocus sucks most of the time.<br/><br/>Overall, I wish I'd gotten another SIII, but this phone will suffice for now. If you're on a budget it's okay.<br/><br/>If you like bloatware.
My husband has had this phone for a few months now and loves it! We were pleasantly surprised to get such a great price on it and he continues to talk about how much he loves it.  He would highly recommend it!
Very happy with this phone - nice big screen, great speakers, simple navigation, solid battery life.  Came over to HTC from Samsung and am not going to look back.  This phone is superior in many, many ways.
Had my phone for about 4/5 months now and still very much in love with it. Such a great phone and takes AMAZING photos. The only poor thing about it is the space.. I can't wait to get my 32g SD card though!
Love it, bought it for my daughter as a replacement. She had this exact one before and loved the size, the photos it takes are clear and the sound quality is fantastic. For a Virgin phone, this is a winner!
Working great out of the box. The only flaw I see on this phone so far is that the 13MP camera doesn't seem to take pictures as clear as I expected when compared to that of other phones that only have 8MP.
An amazing phone for the price, i just turn on airplane mode and download a text/call app and just use it when i have wifi, which is constant. 16 mega pixel camera makes this a mini tablet digital camera.
This is a very nice phone.  I have owned the galaxy s5 and the iphone 6.  For the price of this phone, compared to the high end models, you cannot go wrong.  Also:  My battery lasts all day with heavy use
Great bargain considering the hardware is up to date! Screen is big and clear. Would be better without the cheap plastic feel, but once again..in this price range..not bad. Sound is great on the speakers!
So far so good. From the seller itself, I don't have anything to complain about. It arrived on time w/o damages.<br/>As for the phone, it's good, I've only had it for a week so nothing to really say yet.
I absolutely love my phone
I really love this phone. Its a little bigger than the one I had before and that's what I wanted and so far I have had no problems with  any of the features. Also the camera takes really clear pictures.
Awesome phone for the price. Little bigger than I'm used to but way easier to see when used for navigation. With a case it barely fits in some of my pockets, but that also makes it harder to fall out,
I didn't think it would be this big. Got it in the mail and was shocked how big it was. I like everything about it except you can never turn off BlinkFeed which burns a little battery. I r8 it 8/8 m8.
This is a great phone. I love it! I am using it right now. I did some pretty good research on the phone, but I wasn't quite sure if I should buy it but I do and I do not regret it at all. It's GREAT!
Love this phone, no slowing down with multiple apps open, good picture quality for front & rear camera. And although it is made of plastic, the price and features you get for this phone is a bargain.
I've had this phone for about a month and I love everything about it! The size amazing and so is the picture! The camera quality is amazing! Love the selfie camera! I would definitely recommend this!
I love this phone! I've dropped it so many times and left it outside with minimal water. The speakers are wonderful, and so is screen size. I love this phone so much lol. It is just as good as LG!!!
Great phone. I saved over $70 dollars by ordering here, and the phone is brand new. I would definitely recommend this phone, it took me about 5 minutes to activate it. I'm so happy with my decision.
The phone is large, and I wish it would fit in my pocket better, but I have gotten used to the size in all other ways. Very fast and great resolution. I envisioned the camera being a better quality.
This phone is great! Coming from an iPhone 4S, this screen is fantastic. Though on paper the HTC Desire 816 has a lower pixel density, this screen is every bit as bright and vibrant as a "Retina display."  Battery life is a bit above average and typically lasts me a day. LTE is great when available. I do miss the iPhone's camera however. The HTC has a fantastic camera, but I can't help but think that the iPhone has a better one. BoomSound speakers on the Desire do their job quite well! How come no one else thought of front-firing speakers before?? Calls are crisp and clear. I don't know if anyone else had this problem, but my first few calls seemed really quiet even at full blast. I went online to figure out why and it turns out the speaker is off-center. If you place your ear to the left of the holes, sound increases tremendously. Small adjustment but not deal-breaking by any means.<br/>  I have been a loyal Virgin Mobile customer for many years and their service has always been great. Can't beat $35 for unlimited everything (they gave me a promo plan). Great phone at a great price on a great carrier.
I absolutely love my phone & everyone that sees it loves it too. A lot cheaper than it was at the store and it got here 3 days earlier than the estimated date. Extremely happy with my purchase! (:
Great Product & Service !
Does what its supposed to
Very nice!  Easy to use.  There are some options I miss from my Samsung but nothing I can't do without.  I do have to get use to the on/off button being on the side though.  I would recommend it!
Birthday gift for my son he loves his phone i know for a fact that it takes great pictures, my son loves watching movies on shows great, he seem to love all the features on it so its a five star.
I switched from my windows phone to this and I am glad I did. huge 5.5 screen is perfect for videos. The sound is amazing on this phone. I had it for a month now and still haven't found any flaw.
Love this phone. I have had it for a few months. The batter last longer then my icrap5 phone and has never locked up. I tell everyone to upgrade to truly enjoy what smart phones were made to do.
This phone is excellent.  Call quality is very good and has all of the features I wanted in a phone.  This isn't a flagship phone, but nonetheless, it's quite functional. Battery lasts all day.
Love the phone. I can tell it is mod range, but I really don't mind the simplicity of it. People are constantly asking what kind it is and how much I payed for it. Very happy with this purchase
Phone has been great. A little big but like the bigger phone over a smaller one. Had a VM HTC One V before. What an upgrade. Phone is a lot faster and a lot more user friendly. Great price too.
Honestly coming from being a apple user. I owned a iPhone 5s and it was good till my camera stopped working. I just got this phone today and it's amazing . Same size as the iPhone 6 itself :D
I've had this phone for two days now and it is fantastic! The screen is nice and big, great for watching videos and taking pictures. This is my first mid-range phone and I'm never going back!
Love this phone. I wanted to wait and do a review after I have used it for awhile and I absolutely love it...the color, the size is more than I expected, and the speed. Deff would buy again.
This phone is crazy fast. It's got a huge screen but fits easily in a pocket. A really good affordable phone. If you're in the market for a great prepaid phone, definately consider this one
I have been using this phone myself for several months and I'm so happy with it I purchased this one for my wife.  She is very satisfied with the phone's functionality and the larger size.
I love this phone BUT by the time you do the update to lollipop then there is barely any space left to download anymore applications!<br/><br/>PROS: Camera, speakers, & size.<br/><br/>CONS: Storage space
This is an awesome product! Everything about it is perfect except for one thing- the phones back is made out of very cheap material. It cracks very quickly and easily so get a case asap.
Big bright screen, feels well made. Relatively easy to setup. Video seems HD, though it isn't. Takes HD pics and vids though. Several cases for this model to choose from. Came on time.
Like the phone, sometimes it seems a little big, but the larger screen is better for maps. Pleased with the phone but it crashes and reboots when using the GPS for more than an hour.
Phone is great until I uploaded the lollipop software update. I have ZERO storage and I only have like 6 apps. Only had it a week too. Anyone know a work around please post bout it..
So happy with this phone.  Coming from the desire 610, already familiar with and a huge fan of htc..i have to say I'm impressed. Especially with the camera!!  Thanks amazon and htc!!
Met all expectations, have been very pleased, also very pleased with seller phone arrived ahead of scheduled delivery date well packaged to protect it a great phone at a great price,
had to replace my galaxy after I peed on it love new phone almost as much Sure as I learn how to use it I think I will love it even more. Thinking of getting a second for my Husband
Amazing phone for the price. Very fast and loaded with everything I will need. I had the galaxy equivalent and this is as good or better for a third of the cost. Highly recommended
Great phone. Super Huge screen, sound is amazing. Performance is very fast, click on anything and it comes up right away with no lag. 4GLTE is awesome. Highly recommend this phone.
Phone is awesome. Great camera, very good voice quality, every phone should have boom sound, only down side is the battery life isn't the greatest but it's difently worth the buy.
It's a very nice phone, make sure if you're wanting to get this you find a case during same order or you'll be walking around with a giant phone that's at risks of being dropped.
The phone is not that big.  I am now used to it.  Lightning fast processor speed.  Screen, although decent, not as sharp as some high end models but it doesn't cost $500 either.
I received my phone few days back. Well as of now its working fine and good and hope the same for years.<br/>Features are good for this phone and expecting offers for next time
This is a great phone considering I upgraded from the LG Volt. fast quadcore processor, great Super 720p  5.5" LCD screen, 13 megapixel back camera and 5 megapixel front facing for nice photography or selfies. let's not forget the amazing Sound boom speakers! That's all great til you actually start using the phone for a few days. If you don't get a case, the back become a finger print magnet. If using constantly, battery will only last 5 hours give or take, but if on power saving mode, it will last all day. This phone has a major overheating problem. You really can't use this phone unless it over heats. No matter what you do from using Facebook, Chrome, Snapchat, whatever your fancy, this phone will over heat within minutes quickly. I have disabled many apps on this phone so it isn't running on the background but it doesn't really help. I luckily use Clean Master to help check the temperature and help cool down the device but I must do it every 30 minutes to prevent overheating.
Bigger than I expected it to be. The screen itself is 5.5 inches across which is significantly bigger than my previous phone. Otherwise a pretty solid phone, runs pretty fast.
Great phone for the price! Love the camera, main reason why I got it because of the 13 mgp, the boomsound is great, size is big, but you get use to it! I recommend this phone!
I love everything about this big phone, most of all, the camera. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because I neglected to check the storage capacity. Opt for one with more storage space, because even with the microSD, this phone lacks sufficient storage; and I am not a big app kind of guy. Still a great phone.
Upgraded from a Samsung galaxy victory and this thing blows it away. Love the UI. Great price too. My only complaint is it is just a wee bit too big. It's a phablet for sure.
Best for our family.  Now we all own the HTC Desire 816.  No minute or text outage.  Superior product on all levels + Virgin Mobile has been an unwavering reliable provider.
I love love this phone going from a Samsung S2 to this phone was a dream. I am just figuring out on the cool stuff that is does but I am excited and happy about my purchase.
Love this phone. Phone calls come in so clear. Extremely lightweight. Switching from my old HTC EVO was a breeze using the HTC transfer app. Very pleased with this purchase.
Brand New Replacement or upgrade phone. It's a great device, glad I bought this.1.6ghz processor, BoomSound all the HTC top line features on a low price and no contract !!
Love this phone! I had a HTC before this and this phone has kept my standards on phones quite high! I have already dropped this phone a few times and not even a scratch!
By far the best phone I have ever had, no complaints what-so-ever. I added a microSD card for storage and it gets frequent updates, its fast and has a nice screen size.
This phone is just way too big. It's hard to hold. Harder to carry around. Not a lot of storage space either. Other than that, it's a good phone. Just way too dang big.
Amazing seller I recommend everyone to pay the extra 9$ for next day arrival . And the phone is out standing coming from a galaxy s4 to this I do not regret it one bit.
Really nice phone,only thing from not giving it a five star rating is the sound level when speaking on the phone is a little too low,even when the volume is cranked up.
This product has a short lifespan. Due to Amazon not being an authorized seller you have no help when it stops working.
My first smartphone of any type.  I've joined the 21st century.  Does everything I may need (mainly just wanted internet access).  Easy to use. Clear picture quality.
I got what I expected
so kewl... but big...
Absolutely thrilled with this phone!  HTC is way ahead of Samsung and Apple!!!  I've had both but my HTC beats them both....it's bigger and better in every respect!
The phone was bigger than we expected.But so far it seems to be working out well.Music sounds great on the phone.Got this for my daughter birthday and she loves it.
Not enough Rom and headphone jack loosely fits headphones keeps coming out. other than that awesome phone. Love the screen size, easily type's  texts with a breeze.
Awesome Phone! quick shipping and etc. wish phone had more cases for it. phone is a little jittery and the battery life is okay! good phone though! would recommend
Great phone for the price, the only compromise I have noticed is the battery life which I still get about a 12 hours of use even connected to android wear all day.
Excellent phone. Works fast, and I have not seen one show of lag. It can change fonts and with LTE it's super fast.
Super awesome phone. Just right. Great screen size, movies and videos look good, it's fast enough for what I need.<br/>I ditched the LG Flex for the HTC desire.
Just a great phone, only beef is all the damn preloaded apps which take up a lot of storage space...still 5 stars with great battery life and connection speeds.
Hands down the best Virgin Mobile phone for the price right now! Does everything I need it to do and as fast as I want it to do it. Best phone I have ever had.
Well worth the money
Much better than the desire 510! Don't waste your money on that one. Just buy this one!! I love this phone. It is a battery hog but that's the only negative.
Love this phone! It took some time to get used to the size but its a great phone. The sound quality is awesome and the internal storage capacity is perfect!
Pros: Large screen<br/>  Capable hardware<br/>  Good call quality<br/>  BoomSound speakers!<br/><br/>Cons: Volume rocker isn't as solid as I'd like it.
No issues with mine. Any issues it may have had seemed to have been worked out. Very durable, thin, and sleek device. Excellent build quality. Feels tight.
Sim card slot broke without dropping or anything and being in a case.  No warranty through HTC.  So basically I bought a phone that is completely limited.
The speakers alone make this phone great.<br/>Unlike Samsung, HTC is not trying to turn into Apple. The customization options on this phone are terrific.
Overall great phone only problem for me is the memory storage. There's not a lot of storage In the phone which makes getting apps a little complicated.
Love this device had problem with the SIM card staying in called VM for replacement besides that you'll need root for old Android feel bc Kit Kat sucks
no problems with it
Love this phone! It is so much better than the galaxy s3 I had before. No issues with the seller and it was overnight shipped as requested! Thank you!
I absolutely love this phone with a passion. It does everything I ask it to and it incredibly fast. I would buy this phone again but I don't have to!
Best HTC desire 816 number # 1 on virgin mobile baby! I upgraded from LG volt yea the battery life on the htc pretty good and the sellers  great Job.
We bought 2 of these and we both love them they take great pics good service and excellent speed and memory! I would recommend this phone to anyone!
Had the phone almost a week now and I can say I'm pretty happy with it. Runs nice and smooth, the speakers sound great. Over all worth the purchase.
The HTC desire 816.. is a good phone .. I love it..if you want a big screen and good sound you should buy it.. great for games and watching videos..
Phenomenal phone! It was a little squarely the 1st two weeks, and apps I set up on my home screen would disappear, but haven't had that in 2 months.
WOW! Awesome picture and sound.  Speed is lightning fast.  And the sound quality is GREAT!  Super easy to activate and Battery life so far is good.
This is a really good looking and performance driven phone and the only problem I have is that the battery life isn't all that like my old phone.
Awesome phone at an awesome price! Faster than a S3, but could need more memory too. Other than that, it's a good phone with good functionality.
I love this phone!!!Nice phone for the price!! Big screen and quality pictures.... I have had it for 6 months and haven't had any problems!!!!!!
Most reasonably priced phone for this service. Battery could be better but on 5.5 in screen I can't complain, get a memory card and you are set
seems like nice phone. battery life is not very impress though. hopefully lasts longer than a  full charge does. about 4.5 hours it down to 20%
Great phone. A little large for my wife's hand, but she just loves it! Clear screen, fast processor, best phone for the price on Virgin Mobile.
LOVE this phone!!!
This phone is just like the desire 601 but better faster and bigger overall is a really great phone plus the battery last me more than 2 days
Absolutely love this phone. It's really big, has a decent amount of space, sleek, takes great videos and pictures, and is the perfect weight.
I just received this phone yesterday. As I wanted to upgrade from my galaxy 3.it's an amazing phone. Much better then what I had In the past!
I LOVE THIS PHONE!!! The speakers are great, it is super fast, and it works great with Virgin Mobile, which is a GREAT company to deal with.
Love the phone but the gps on ant that great good for short runs but any thing over 60mils it heats up then i lose my gps till it cools down
This was such an upsetting phone! Honestly, the worst one I've ever had, and it lasted me less than two months and now it's failing to respond to touch: the screen is NOT cracked because I'm careful with my phones, but it's got this almost cracked appearance underneath the touch screen and whenever I try to answer a phone call or do anything, it is completely unreadable. Merely colorful lines all violently moving across the screen. I've had problems with this phone before: Updates that would cause endless crashes to the point that I couldn't do anything with the phone except a factory reset., horrible lag to the point I'd have to restart it regularly, and the unnecessary HTC backup that I couldn't find a way to turn off. I'm done with this product and its producer.
Bought this phone and it didn't even come with a sim card...its pretty much useless. Contacted the seller and they were absolutely no help.
This phone is rock solid. Much better than the Virgin Mobile Supreme aka ZTE Supreme. HTC makes a great phone.<br/><br/>Perfect size too.
I love this phone. Its fast and smooth. Perfect size for me and of course very inexpensive. I suggest investing in a screen protector :)

I love this phone. Its fast and smooth. Perfect size for me and of course very inexpensive. I suggest investing in a screen protector :)
For the price it is a solid phone, nothing high end of course but screen size is perfect and overall best phone for VM, not including s5
This phone is everything I wanted and thought it would be.  I'm still learning all the it can do.  The size is large but perfect for me.
Great phone, fast, speedy, nice upgrade from my old Triumph. Feels big at first but if you have large hands you'll get used to it quick.
Great phone, no issues yet and I've had it over 1 year. Which is surprising because Virgin Mobile phones usually need replacing by now.
Awesome phone. Never had any problems and love taking pictures with it. The only annoying thing is trying to find a good case for it.
I love this phone. The battery lasts me all day. The camera takes great pictures in good lighting. It works fast. Highly recommended.
Love it. Cane the very next day. Brand new. Works amazingly well. Very versatile and has features that appeal to everyone. #CoolBeans
very good phone lasted morevthan a year even tho i drpped it like fifteen times it finally went out yesterday when it fell on water.
This phone is a great value. No complaints other then it on the big side to carry but then again the big screen is easy on old eyes!
Love my phone! I really like the camera it's really clear with great quality. Only downside is some of the apps you can't uninstall.
For the price (paid $179 delivered) its great.  Be advised you are limited by the available memory to a dozen or so additional apps.
Phone was purchased as a Christmas gift for our son.  It is rarely out of his sight!  He loves the dual speakers and the big screen.
Excellent sound quality. No issues with battery life, as has been mentioned elsewhere. I strongly advise getting a protective case.
Great phone at a great deal, fell In love with it. Has a great camera n good battery life. I feel so lucky to have found this deal.
my 15 yo son loved it for xmas, it has a giant screen and is almost like a small tablet. good speakers and nice sound, nice camera.
Order was extremely quick.<br/>Phone works very well, easy to switch service from older phone to this one.<br/>No complaints yet!
One of the best phones ever made, nice large screen for texting, super loud stereo speakers, fast processor, all around great phone
It's good phone the speaker is loud for music and for the price it's a good deal and the 5.5 inch is good for watching YouTube vids
I want to rate this 5 stars because it came on time. No package damage and it's the best phone I've ever owned so far. Great but!!
My girlfriend is in love with this phone, it just released the new firmware update not to long ago (android 5.0) and it's amazing!
I love this phone. I was a bit skeptical about getting it from the Amazon marketplace for the price. It came on time and I love it
I love this phone. I am on the same wireless plan but this phone is blazing faster than my old iphone. And it has better features.
This phone was such a good deal. The battery life is the best of any smart phone I've had to date. The picture quality is amazing.
The wife loves her "fablet".  Plenty of options for her to play around with.  She has always loved the HTC line of phones.
I think the phone is great ... big screen, but not to big to fit in my pocket. Great camera and a lot of nice features ...love it
I love this phone! Great alternative to the IPhone... Decently priced phone.. good battery life and good camera...glad I upgraded
This phone is awesome looks sharp very colorful detail. Connects super fast would highly recommend this phone and its affordable.
Really enjoying this phone. Light, big, great pictures and is so much fun for the kids to watch shows. Great for my business too!
Best phone I have ever owned to date. Its thin, and has a wide chassis...sounds like the perfect woman.. can't be a coincidence.
Best phone virgin mobile has to date. Battery life could be better. But 200 bucks for a solid no contract phone. Can't complain.
Surprissingly Awesome from my past experience with HTC one v.  It's quick, loud, and takes great picks. ***** 5 stars all day!!!
A very nice phone for the price. Bigger than I really wanted. Good sound through the two front speakers and very good pictures.
Speed  camera screen resolution usage size speakers durability of body of phone all good love this phone would purchase again.
I thought I was going to hate the huge screen... boy I was wrong. Fits in pocket nicely. Android rules. The camera is awesome.
Bought for a Christmas present for my daughter.  She loved it! She gets asked why is she carrying a phone the size of a tv :)
Great Phablet!  Love the size and function and it gets the looks!  Speakers are awesome and by far the best phone I have had.
Very nice phone for m son he loves it so much well its a nice smart many features  for his needs thanks chose the best phone
I love this phone! It's so quick and a little on the larger side, but I don't mind it. So much better than my old Optimus V.
It was a great deal for the price. I would highly recommend it to anyone. In fact my friends son purchased one from Amazon.
This phone kicks my old IPhone's a$$ and Virgin Mobile does the same to AT&T.; I'm so glad I switched providers and phones.
The best phone I've ever had! Outstanding Camera, smooth, powerful, robust and awesome display at 5.5 inches. Nuff said...
One of the best phones I've ever bought. Total replacement for my Samsung Galaxy S3 and I couldn't be more happy with it.
Great phone.  4 stars instead of 5 because of the camera, which does not take great pictures, even with 13 megapixels.  .
The best phone I've ever had. the extra large screen and general phone functionality make it perfect for my everyday use.
Fantastic phone.I would recommend this phone to anyone who does not want to have a contract on their phone for two years.
Luv the quad-core...  Does EVERYTHING I need very well... Nothing great unfortunately...<br/><br/>Very happy overall...
Great speakers.
I love this phone. It has a great battery life , but the camera quality isn't the best. The size is out standing though.
I 100% love this phone. My dad and sister have this device and had great reviews. So myself loving big phones with an awesome cameras had to have this phone! I got it a day early with my case and I was so excited, I freaked out and basically screamed. The only downside is it did take 4 hours to update the system, but that long 4 hours was worth it, the phone is so fast, it came preloaded with so many emojis, and apps that I use (like instrgram, facebook, twitter ect). I should probably stop this review here or I could ramble on for ever!! But to sum this up. If you want a big phone with an awesome camera I definally  recommend the Htc Desire 816
No problems with phone. I bought this for my wife to replace an older model Samsung Galaxy. This phone was an improvement in almost every way. The price was good and the signal/reception has been good everywhere she goes. She always brags how her phone and service plan are so much cheaper than my T-Mobile plan and phone I had to buy. She gets service with Virgin Mobile in areas where my T-Mobile phone does not. The phone itself has a large good quality screen and good audio. It never seems to bog down when having multiple things going on at the same time on the phone. The battery life is good and there are lots of accessories available for it.
I love this phone! Great quality. My only gripe with the phone is that the power and volume buttons are a little loose.
So happy with this phone! No issues. Only problem was the lack of storage but I just bought a 32G SD card and love it.
This phone works great. I ordered it for my girlfriend and she loves it. Great battery life and has an awesome screen.
IF YOU YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A NICE SIZE PHONE I RECOMMED THIS PHONE ITS JUST THE RIGHT SIZE..RECOMMED A PHONE CASE TOO..
Great Phone , It's Been One Month Since I Had It And It's Working Great For Me , And Very Good Delievery And Price....
For the price its a good phone but after one year of use the battery started failing and now its pretty much useless.
Awesome phone. I'm glad I waited and did not buy the LG volt. This has better specs and It can take a micro ad 128gb.
I suspect those posting negative reviews for this phone probably don't even have it.  This phone is awesome...period!
I have had a Galaxy S III and the Iphone 5 and I enjoy this HTC Desire 816 so much more than my previous phones. The battery life on the phone is excellent and the ability to get my music from Itunes to the phone was effortless compared to the Galaxy I had. The phone has an extremely fast processor. I don't find myself waiting for anything! The speakers alone on this phone are something to buy the phone for itself. I love to listen to the crisp sound coming from my phone. The only draw back for me is that the phone seems to be a little bit to big for my pocket, but that is a price I am willing to pay to have a bigger phone.
Great phone.  Definitely worth the price.  Very user friendly.  Huge, hi-res screen; and the processor is very fast.
My first smart phone and I love it.  It is easy to use and very functional.  I would recommend this phone to anyone!
Great phone for the money and available with a very economic plan, would of given 5 stars if it was full HD display.
Nice phone. It's powerful and has a great screen . BUT the battery dies way to fast. That's the only problem I have.
Phone is perfect! Received NEW in original VM packaging. Wife likes this phone A LOT better than the Galaxy she had.
According to Amazon, I am not entitled to write a negative review about a product despite the review not being vulgar at all. This will be the last review I will write. This is a decent phone but it will constantly ask you to sign up for stuff and will tell you that an error has occured signing into your gmail despite being signed in. I would include a picture, but im afraid Amazon wouldnt appreciate that very much.
Awesome. Besides Comes with almost all memory taken up . And not good internet connection... Might be my area idk
Love it so far
love the phone
Great mid grade phone. It's no galaxy note 5 but it's a big phone that works great. Can't beat it for the price.
Excellent phone<br/>Best phone in its category but have a look at here on new future<br/>http://bit.ly/1oZUD3T
Great phone, Fast Service and Great Price. This adds up to a Five Start Rating for the Manufacturer and Seller.
This phone is awesome!!!! Never really liked the bigger phones but this one changed that. Highly recommend it.
I am so happy with this phone! It took a while to get used to the larger size, but I love everything about it.
Great phone. An upgrade from my Optimus Elite. Very big, bigger than expected, but you get use to it quickly.
Great phone I got this for my daughter and she loves it!!! Great phone for a great price and quick delivery!
HUGE display and looks beautiful. Very awesome sound when playing music.<br/>Screen is very fragile though.
Love this phone!  The screen quality is exellent, seems to operate extremely fast. I would highly recommend!
Phone is so good. My mom switched from her galaxy.  Sister and brother and their fams may also follow suit.
This is my second HTC 816 - lost the first one. Biggest problem is the very very limited RAM for use apps.
Very big phone. I got my moneys worth. I still haven't learn all the features of it. It's an awesome phone
Great mid price phone. Love the large screen. Would give it 5 stars but comes with to many unwanted apps.
Outstanding!!! Only draw back is 8g internal memory! But you can add a sd card of 128g. so it works out!!
Love this phone! Huge screen, fast, and the 13mp camera takes amazing photos and videos! Extremely happy!
Love it. Crystal clear display. very fast processing power. Love the 5.5 screen. Fantastic phone overall.
FAST SHIPPING, BRAND NEW IN VIRGIN MOBILE PACKAGING, NO PROBLEMS SWITCHING MY NUMBER! PERFECT EXPERIENCE!
Great phone for the price.  Best deal for Virgin Mobile customers.  Does everything I need a phone to do.
I love this phone the only downside for me is the glossy back I would recommend getting a case with it.
It came in a timely manner and was exactly what I expected I would advise every one to go buy this item
Bought this phone for my husband.  He absolutely loves it.  The screen is huge and is very easy to use.
I've never had an HTC | Android phone as amazing as this phone. It's fast and just amazing. I love it.
This is a great phone, screen is clear, takes great pictures, sounds great, just great all the around.
Seller told me the phone was ready to activate but it was not.  It was still set up with the previous owner and still activated under previous owners name, number and Gmail acct.  Therefore i could not activate without having the previous owners password to deactivate their acct first.  What a nightmare!!!  Ive never had so many issues with a VM phone before.
Great phone for the price, and great personal tech service, when you need to call with a question! T.
I loved this phone. Unfortunately I got tired of Virgin Mobile and moved on... otherwise five stars.
Fantastic phone! Super fast, easy to use, slim, great screen, excellent pictures, and a great price!
love this phone !!! this is the 3r one I have ordered for family members. the battery last very long
Awesome phone, snappy and large. Decent battery life, great great connectivity, and uses android 5.
My everyday phone.  Is working well.  Fast, reliable, no memory issues, and I love the screen size.
It's nice and big. The speakers are sufficiently loud. My only complaint is about the battery life.
Good phone. Reception not the best. Space bar too small and doesn't always pick up when I press it.
Phone is very big love it. It can cover any resolution trust me it can watch hd videos all the time
Awesome phone! It takes fantastic pictures!! The internet speed is dynamic! I am extremely pleased
My husband loves this phone. works amazing great android.  It was however bigger then he expected.
awesome phone. i have virgin mobile service and this phone works everywhere. great internet. fast
Love it; however, hate that this isn't gorilla glass on it. Other than that, it is a great phone.
Fits phone well (snug) but easily allows phone to be removed.  Well constructed. Very satisfied.
Love this phone big screen is awesome and the camera will blow u away defently worth the money.
Since Used it after , I  feeled  super good, I like it very much ! Now, I recommend it to you !
Three weeks into owning this phone and happy thus far. Still learning features but all is well.
It's a simple phone, but lovely to use. Very smooth and fast, and most importantly, affordable.
Bought this as an early birthday gift for my wife, she loves her new phone and its big screen.
The phone is good and it's fast and  the extra bass these little speakers produce is flawless.
Great phone.....fast processor,big clear screen.....can't say enough good thismoking about it
Brought this phone for my little sister, it's a great phone worth every penny.. fast delivery
Love it. Camera is good, works smoothly. Had it for a month now and I am very happy with it.
It's amazing everything I expected , a little big but great quality . Plus at a great price
After 2 months the headphone jack quit working. Amazon says not eligible for return.
Great phone
So far I love this phone. Its very large but the picture quality and speed are excellent!
This phone works great, great speed, and long battery life. The sound is pretty good too.
Good mobile I just hate that it only has 8GB internal.  I just purchased a 64GB SD card.
still learning to use this phone. Much more intense than my last one. so far seems good.
Its everything I expected from HTC! Ultra thin even with a protective case (Ultra thin)!
The flash isn't working its a real disappointment. How do I talk to someone about this?
Just purchased this phone and so far I am extremely pleased! Great phone , great price.
Awesome phone, I love the size and the battery life. Best smart phone I have ever owned
Love this phone....Battery seems to drain a lot with the apps I have downloaded tho...
Case has been really helpful. It's solid and stylish. Well made. I'm a big fan so far.
Good phone but can't work in my country. Sound and screen are excellent. I recommend.
I love it, but the memory is not so great , but luckily I'm not a big app down loader
Bought this for my husband. He loves it. HUGE screen is great for games and YouTube.
lovvvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee this phone. It is soooooooooooooooooo massive.
Worst phone since the invention of smart phones.  Constantly losing network and requires reboot,  so much bloatware from htc.... It has 8 gig internal storage and 6 is taken with previous installed garbage.  I am switching back to my galaxy s3.... I can have more than 6 apps on it
It gets a little weird connecting to the network sometimes, overall awesome phone.
Excellent phone, super fast, plenty of storage, excellent screen size and clarity.
<br/>
received the phone fast. It works great & didn't have any problems activating it.
Great phone.  Doesn't allow for the monthly hot spot usage.  Just daily at $5.00.
Great Phone for the price. Has features comparable to much more expensive phones.
This phone is amazing for the price.  I get so many compliments on it.  Love it.
Really good--- lots of features you would expect to see only on high end phones!
Just love the phone. So easy to use and work. Battery last much longer too 📱😃
I'm very happy with the phone. Plenty fast for my needs and great battery power
Received in record time and this phone is one of the best phone I have ever had
Fast with large screen, phone is thin and slips easily into my front pocket
Everything works fine, a lot better than I expected for ann inexpensive phone!
Fast shipping. Love this phone nice upgrade for me. Has a lot of cool features
I love the phone and have had no problems. I wish Otterbox made a case for it.
Great phone. The screen size is wonderful, a very good price for such a phone.
I absolutely love this phone!!!! Definitely recommend this phone to anybody!!
I love, love love my new phone!!!!! It does everything it is supposed to do.
Love this phone, very light for its size.  Great camera and Boom sound rocks
Shopcelldeals I luv you ! This phone FOR ME is awesome on so many levels
Awesome phone for the price. Over 100$ cheaper than almost everywhere else.
Love this phone!!  Not as expensive as other smart phones and works great!!
You can't beat this deal. This phone is amazing for the price I paid, $195.
Best phone I ever owned, powerful, sleek and stylish with fast performance!
Love this phone. Have had a few months with no problems. Long battery life
Almost as nice as galaxy4. Good replacement for the virgin mobile network.
I love it
I was so excited about this phone originally, but now only a few months later it's been a nightmare. Random reboots throughout the day, repeatedly failing to receive text messages, large swaths of unremovable bloatware, etc. It's not at all the level of quality I would expect for the price, and the fact that I'm needing a replacement device less than six months later is laughable.
Great phone I ever had yet. The battery life I do not like. It dies fast.
Nice big phone, battery lasts long, screen needs to be brighter outdoors.
Pretty nice phone so far, and very satisfied with their shipping. Thanks!
It's an amazing phone nice size screen defiantly good for apps or YouTube
Great camera with fun photo features.  Price feels like a bargain to me.
fantastic phone the best I have ever had quick delivery fast activation.
Best skin I ever used, easy to install and you can't tell it's even on.
Love this phone battery lasts a long time and it was a great experience
Luv this phone. I'm glad I got it rather than the Galaxy S5 or I-phone.
My niece loves it!  Now I'm looking for to purchase one for my daughter
It's really nice phone for the price-tag. You won'y find anything to beat that price and quanlity. The huge screen is PLUS. You will love it.<br/>However, due to the lack of Gyroscope sensor, this phone will not be good with the APPs with required Gyroscope.<br/><br/>But don't worry, if you are not really a tech savvy, you will not need those sensors any way.
As described nice phone I like it verry much good price fast shipping.
I love this phone I had a boost phone and iam glad I have it, good buy
Still don't know all that this phone can do, but I am very impressed!
Love this phone it's amazing! Everything I've ever wanted in a phone.
I'm in love!!!!!! I love everything about the phone! Zero complaints!
I was extrenely happy with this phone. That was ubtil This phone's lcd screen cracked while in the front pocket and now it wont display anything but blurry colors. The case was on and I was just in my office doing my work and when I pulled out my phone,  the lcd screen wouldnt turn on. I may have just gotten a defective phone. Should not have done that.
The phone's sim card just randomly popped out and it stopped working
It's really big and has a good sound and good thing I got this phone
Great smartphone for the price. Works great. Camera especially good
Best phone ive ever had but then again i am coming from an iphone 4
I was happy with this phone until I tried downloading apps. I have 3 apps ibhave downloaded and now I can't download anymore. This phone comes  with a bunch of apps taking up phone storage that I do not need. There is no way to delete them . It's very frustrating to not be able to have the apps I want on here. Info not recommend this phone.
Awesome!
excellent deal great phone runs fast I really recommend this phone
Great phone. Get it if you don't want or can't get the new iPhone.
I love this phone more then my galaxy s3. It was totally worth it.
This is an awesome phone.  Very fast, great camera, perfect size.
This phone is amazing, hasn't disappointed me. Very good phone!!!
For the price this is definitely a steal, its an excellent phone.
Battery sucks, but the phone runs very smoothly without problems
great phone...just too big for me..I ended up with the 510 model
I love my phone . I came in quick and was easy to get used to 😁
Nice big phone with a good display and camera for a great price.
It's huge!!! I love it. Totally different than my lg optimus f3.
The phone overall is great. Easy to use. Great camera and sound.
I love this phone! Battery life is great! I highly recommend it!
This phone is awesome! Very happy that<br/> it arrived on time
Works great and is worth the price. No problems with the Phone.
Just received my phone today from them, and the phone is amazing and very pleased so far. The price is amazing definitely cannot beat it for the size a quality of the phone. It's not your samsung galaxy s5 or note3 but it's just as nice in my opinion. The phone is just really nice. I will update after a couple weeks. :)
Great smartphone at the best price that I could find anywhere.
bouth this for my teenage granddaughter. She loves this phone.
Sooo glad I didn't get the LG Volt. This phone is for use on U.S. Virgin prepaid plans. Snappy response, tri-band for better reception, gorilla glass 2 720p display, sense 6.0, amplified speakers with high audio quality... Not just loud. I am loving this phone and will let everyone know if I encounter any issues.
Very nice phone for the money, big step up from my optimus f3
I was going to buy this phone but the price just went up 40$ but it looks good and from what I hear its pretty high end for a mid ranged phone so if that price drops I'll buy it in an instant
Performance, condition, price and delivery time as expected.
so far so good. this is my first phone. very pleased so far.
This will work on many other networks with just a SIM swap.
I'm very happy with the HTC Desire 816. I give it 5 stars..
Great phone .<br/>Great price.<br/>Recommended services.
The Phone is Good wish the Emoji's were Better but 👍.....
Absolutely love this phone. Very pleased with my purchase.
Great phone, one of the smartest purchases I've ever made.
I'm loving this phone , it's really big has a nice screen
I Love This Phone. Best Phone I've Ever Had. Coming From A Galaxy S3 This Is A Major Upgrade . The Size Is Perfect For Me . My Sister Ordered Mine As Soon As She Saw Mine . The Only Thing I Dont Like Is How Difficult It Is To Find A Good Case.  But Amazing Phone . Sound Is Amazing BTW.
This is actually a good phone. especially for the price.
In love with this phone!!!!! Especially the 13mp camera.
Omg I love this phone such an upgrade from my old phone.
It was on time & fast getting here. I love the phone too
Work's good but having problems downloading to sd card .
Love my new phone . It was delivered right on time.....
I bought it for my wife for Christmas and she loves it.
Such an excellent phone! Was not dissapointed one bit.
Amazing phone for the price. Awful awful battery life.
Great phone very very fast I upgraded from a galaxy s3
my son is going to love it. I was stone how big it is.
Phone worked,  but had an issue with the LED display.
Love this phone!  Wonderful features, no bugs so far.
I REALLY LIKE THIS PHONE, WORKS BETTER THAN MY GALAXY
Love this phone. Battery holds up nicely. Super fast!
Perfect phone, amazing price. I am very very pleased.
Good phone terrible service.  Terrible service plans
It works really well.  I've had no problems with it.
Haven't had a problem to date! Great large display!!
Love the phone had it last year and still going! :D
I absolutely love this phone. I have no complaints.
Great phone.couldn't be happier with this purchase.
Best mid level phone ever HTC is an awesome company
Ive been a Virgin customer for at least 15 years, I love the prepaid low cost plans. This is probably my last ever Virgin plan phone, I'm tired of their crappy non existent tec support. This phone would not send or receive .nz right out the box, my last Virgin phone developed the same issue which their tec support had no idea how to fix but I found an easy Youtube video tutorial to fix it. Now this one has the same issue but after a lifetime talking to Virgin reps and half a day of googling fixes I'm over it. I'm going to return the phone and try a different carrier. Their are several forum threads on this issue with no resolutions as far as I can see. Life is too short to try and fix expensive things that should work in the first place: (
I love my HTC phone it works very good no problems
Great product,came on time;very satisfied with it.
Had phone for 5 months now keyboard freezes randomly and the SIM card will no longer stays engaged in it's slot I love the features that this and other htc's I've had in the past have but they just don't last so this will be the last htc I will own
No complained, excellent product for the money...
So far it's good,nice big screen and good picture
This phone rocks!!! I was looking for a big screen phone and saw this one at Radio shock and then I check the reviews on Amazon and it was on sale and just got it, everything in this phone is perfect and surpass all my expectations. 10 stars!!!
I just bought this phone and I'm ready to stomp it into the ground. I HATE google. EVERYTHING seems tied to google and won't work without it. No 5GHz. Transfer app. only transfered about a half dozen of many dozens of contacts from old phone.
Fast phone,great battery,could use more storage.
Early arrival great looking phone... I love it!!
Purchased for my son, and he loves it. Happy Mom
Works fine.  Good screen.  I would buy it again.
Phone is awesome!!!! Extremely fast shipping!!!
Fast shipping & great quality. Overall perfect.
Love love this phone best buy hands down by far. Shipping was ok paid for 2 day shipping was suppose to come on Saturday but didn't come till Monday
Phone is excellent. Nice screen size, and fast.
I thought I was upgrading from the Samsung S3 but this phone screen quality is not that nice, though it is larger. I should have researched it more. You're better off spending the extra 20 bucks and getting something nicer. This phones OS seems more limited and uncustomizable maybe because its HTC not sure. Phones is fast and doesnt lag when switching apps or running games.<br/>If you have small hands you might get frustrated with this phone, I have giant hands and Im annoyed with the volume rocker and power button being annoyingly on the left side of the phone.<br/>PROS<br/>Great sounding speakers.<br/>Excellent battery life<br/><br/>CONS<br/><br/>Everything else
This is by far the best phone I have ever had!
Great phone. And shipping was fast and on timr
Great phone, The best phone I have ever owned.
Great mid-range device from the people at HTC.
It's the best phone I ever had so far. Thanks.
Quick transaction. Exactly what was described!
Luv it!  Superior phone at a phenomenal price!
Awesome! And surprisingly great battery life!
Have to constantly redo things, every time an app updates it is removed from the SD card, have to reset alarms and default ringtone, WiFi turns off for no reason, screen goes blank when receiving call. This phone sucks!
I absolutely love this phoooonnneeeeee!!!!!!!
Perfect I love this phone it's worth the $177
Great phone only downside is the battery life
Good deal. Arrived on time. No issues at all.
Great phone, larger than expected but great.
Great Phone! Quick, easy to use, great size!
It has what I'm looking for in a cellphone.
Battery not so good<br/>Camera is alright
I LOVE THIS PHONE!BETTER THAN MY GALAXY...
Great Phone No Complaints In Fact Love It!
Big screen. Battery lasts for a long time.
Great phone, HUGE display, decent battery life (gets through the day with good service or wifi) and processor works great! VERY satisfied with my purchase and would HIGHLY recommend this phablet to others!
It came quick, and the phone works great.
wish it had a big storage 16 gb not 8 gb.
I love this phone. The camera is amazing!
Great phone! I love it! Great price too!
like it very much so far. hope it last!!
I love it & for the price it's great!!!!
Best phone I have purchased in this price point. Beautiful display, nice sound, and nice BIG display (without being overly huge). Def. recommend if you are looking for a nice virgin mobile phone!
Phone is crap!  Gave to a friend as a gift.  He has had it barely 2 months and today the screen died - went black for No reason  - was not dropped or damaged in any way.  Extremely Disappointed
Great battery life. Great phone overall
Amazing phone! It's like a mini tablet.
Great phone all around love screen size
Love the [hone.  Excellent battery life
Best phone ever. Beat my iphone by far.
Awesome phone! Lightning fast delivery!
I love this phone. It is big and smart.
Purchased phone for my birthday in September 2014, I replaced my Samsung galaxy note and still wanted the screen size. I am very satisfied with this phone. I really like the HTC platform.
The phone itself is remarkable , I am still learning all its features . The only drawback is Virgin Mobile plans , data wise . I will post in the future as I continue  with this phone .
Good phone but wish it had more memory
It doesn't work the GPS .it lost señal
It is used to Venezuela International?
Love this phone. Works perfect for me.
Nice phone better so far than my last.
Best phone I've had with virgin mobile

Awesome phon at a spectacular price.
love the larger screen, easy to use.
I love everything about my new phone
Very good,smooth,and simply the best
This phone exceeded my expectations.
I LOOOOVEE this phone its big enough
I had this phone for about a month and then the power button stopped working. I sent it in for warranty repair since this was a normal problem that seemed to happen with this phone. HTC took 3 weeks to send it back, when I finally got it back I could no longer use this phone with virgin mobile. After virgin mobile said I couldn't use this phone with them I called HTC figuring they messed something up inside the phone. Well they said they had to change the motherboard to replace the power button and that the carrier must have got switched. They told me they would call be back within 5 business days to see what they could do. I ended up calling back a week later, they still had no clue what to do and told me they will call me back within 24 to 48 hrs. Three days later still no call. I called them back and had to explain everything over AGAIN and they still said we will call you back in 24 hrs. Called back and now after explaining AGAIN I have to wait 5 more days for them to get back to me. I have stopped being nice on the phone calls. I can not take HTC anymore. This is the last time I will ever buy an HTC product. I have not been able to use my phone now for two months becuase of them. Worst $250 I have ever spent and worst customer service I have ever had.
It's entertaining, not frustrating.
LOve it, great phone for the price.
love my phone 🙌😄 deff a great buy
Amazing phone. Everything I wanted!
Loveing my phone,thanks you Amazon.
I have had this phone for over a week now and it's been the best phone I ever had my upgrade from the Galaxy S3.<br/><br/>Just a quick tip for those who have this phone or who are thinking of buying it. If you want your device to be more functional and responsive look at the info down below.<br/><br/>Step 1. Go to settings then go into Developers options.<br/><br/>Step 2. Go to Runtime and select Art. Then stay in Developer Options and go to Advance then go to Animation Scales and turn to .5x<br/><br/>Touch screen response and function will be very accurate.
Excellent phone!!!!! Thank you !!!!
Good
For the price, it's a great phone.
Great phone and for a great price.

I'm in love with my new phone
Girlfriend Loves the Phone!!!
I absolutely LOVE this phone!
Great case, I am loving it!!!
After 48 hours the screen resolution went haywire -  colors were all wrong.  Sending back -  hopefully the exchange will work better.
I recently bought this phone maybe in feb. when I received the phone I loved it! It was a big phone, bigger then any phone I ever had. I like the camera and it was easy to work. But after a while I started to hate it. Heres my reason why I don't recommend this phone. The storage sucks!!!!!! if you're like me I love my apps, ( facebook, snapchat,instagram) and I love my pictures. After a while storage was getting low and I had to start deleting ALOT of apps and almost all of my pictures! Thank God that I had a sd card from my old phone and was able to save some pictures but for the most part I have to go on ig and fb to get my pictures because I had to delete them all.. The straw that broke the camel back. Wednesday morning I was trying to download an app after I delete almost every single app on my phone and all of my pictures and it would let me.. I decided to say forget it and get a new phone. I just got my new phone today! So all together this phone is good if you don't download a lot of apps and don't take a lot of pictures. but if you download a lot and take a lot of pics I suggest you to get another phone or a sd card..
Super awesome great phone!!!
Very cool eight-star product
Far Exceeded my expectations
Love my phone!  Huge screen.
Excellent. I love the phone.
Awesome phone. Huge upgrade.
I would recommend this phone

Great phone for the price
GREAT PHONE FOR THE PRICE
Great phone fast shipping
Coming from an iphone5 with Sprint at 80 dollars a month I was looking for something more economical. I had used Virgin Mobile in the past and always thought their service was crappy but maybe it was my crappy android that was the problem a few years ago. I'm practically married and I don't need a phone with unlimited minutes and all that so I thought this was good and it is. For 35 a month I chose to get unlimited data and texting with 300 minutes cuz I hardly ever talk anyway. One month later and I don't really have any complaints. I went to the VM website and set it all up and didn't even have to talk to any annoying customer service people. You can either choose auto pay or pay manually each month and they do make it easy to understand. Anyway, on to the phone. My other half has the iphone6 plus and I have the htc 816 so I can definitely give you a hands on comparison. The quality isn't going to compare to the iphone6. The iPhone definitely feels heavier and more solid, the vide... Read more
Love the functionality and style but with the system update there is no space to add apps. Time for a new phone.
I really like this phone
good phone and low price
Great phone, I love it!!
Very nice prepaid phone!
Really liked it!!😍😍😍
Awesome phone I love it
Great phone. Thank you.
Everything was perfect!
Great phone great price
good. really worth it.
I lovee the phone this
Bought two of these and so far I love them. Nice big screen. 13mp camera and 5mp on front camera.
My favorite purchase.
bigger than I thought
Awesome android phone
I absolutely love this phone! I just got it last month, and I must say it is perhaps the best smartphone I've ever had! I found it on Amazon for way less than through carrier! My favorite feature is HTC Boomsound. The sound is so crisp and clear. I don't hear any static or crackles. The screen size is excellent! The battery lasts me the entire day! I normally only charge it once a day and then again right before I go to sleep. I don't like the HTC Blinkfeed feature. I feel that it's just software preloaded that bloats my phone. However, I have no problems with lag. The phone is fast, stylish, large, and the sound quality is the best! I previously had the Desire 510 and that was a great phone too, but this one blows it clear out of the water! Thanks, HTC for making an amazing phone & thank you AMAZON for making it affordable!!! (:
Great phone
This is my third HTC Android phone and I love it.<br/>Plenty of internal memory for lots of apps, phone is fast and responsive, the speakers are far better than most cell phones, and the screen looks great.<br/>I have not found any app that has trouble running on this phone, including a couple very big games.<br/>I've found battery life to be very good, and I use the screen on a very bright setting.<br/>You'll use far less power on Wifi than LTE - but either way it'll get you through the day with normal use.<br/><br/>Camera is best HTC I've had so far, but still leaves a lot to be desired (get it?), especially in lower light or fast action situations.  It does actually work fairly well with the flash - a first for a phone that I've owned.  The whole "photographer's dream" description is a bit much.
It was a good phone, but now my SIM card won't stay in my phone. Really ticked off about that
LOVE this phone thx!
Good quality product
im in love with it!!
Brought this product for someone else. Therefore I cannot give an accurate review of it.
Perfect! I love it!
It's huge I love it
Great phone for VM.
Great Phone so far.
great phone love it
Love this phone!!!!
I've had this phone a month now. I highly recommend getting this phone. For the money, it compares very well to other much more expensive phones. I added a 32 gig SD card which is more than enough to hold my photos and music. Battery life is good, so long as you have power saver enabled. You will have to turn off power saver to allow the screen brightness to turn up all the way, or the screen is too dim in outdoor daylight. I use turn by turn directions (GPS) a lot, so I plug into the car battery. Most apps work well, but I'm having a little trouble with Allcast and AllConnect, neither of which recognize data on the SD card. I'm working with support on these issues.<br/><br/>HTC telephone support is also top notch.
Nice. Like a boss.

Awesome phone :-)
This phone is great. If you need a new phone on virgin mobile, get this one.
This phone has a known defect where the nano SIM card pops out and will not click back in. It's the spring in the slot, I guess. I'm an adult using my phone exact out the way it's supposed to be used, and less than two weeks after the Return window closed, the phone stops functioning. Nice. Google it. I'm not the only one.
Really good buy!
Best value phone

Phone is fine, definitely a downgrade from my Samsung galaxy but also WAY cheaper so I was expecting this. Overall it's an average mid-range phone for the price, but it has huge issues with storage. Most apps can't be moved to external storage and I'm constantly out of space. Also, it  has a high megapixel camera, but somehow manages to take really blurry pics. I've never had this issue with my galaxies... Even the older versions that had half the megapixels still took more clear crisp pics than this phone.

No complaints.. Read a lot of reviews before hand and the biggest complaint was the battery. I Don't understand what people had troubles with. I'm on it all the time thru out the day. Elements kingdoms, always playing and maybe have to charge it once. I suggest using the recent apps button often. You close all apps at once. Haven't had lag on any game, resolution is very good, all around a fantastic phone. Would suggest nice case and tempered glass screen protector.
Exellent buy
I love it!!!
Like it alot

The arrival of the era of popular mobile Internet, smart phones have become a major trend in the mobile phone market. The emergence of such mobile intelligent terminal has changed many people's lifestyle and needs of traditional communication tools, I am no longer satisfied with using the phone's appearance and basic functions, and began to pursue powerful mobile operating system to bring more stronger, more personalized social services.
I loved it. It was totally worth it.

Wonderful phone, fast shipping! Great size 👌
Perfect. Just as I wanted. Shipped in a day!
At first the big screen seems overwhelming and you think to much, but the big screen and front facing speakers make am amazing entertainment device. The camera is alsosurprisingly good for being a 200 dollar phone and the screen seems very responsive and you could actually look at it in the Sun I really recommend this phone. Also get a case for it, fingerprints like to get on the back.
Phone is just Mac daddy<br/>It works amazing great quality<br/>If your looking for any phone I'd high my rec. This one<br/>And at a great price everywhere else wanted 300. Or more
Good phone
I love it.
great item

Awesome 📱
My wife loves her phone. No issues at all.
The phone is a great phone but the only problem was that it was already activated by SOMEONE ELSE and i bought it new. i dont think that they ship you new ones. dont risk it.
I love the phone, but hate the ridiculous 8 gb of internal storage. I have to clean the hell out of it just to update my apps. Shame on you, HTC. Come on, you're better than that. We're living in a technology era and you offer a phone with only 8 gb of storage??? The one good thing I will say is that the battery life is excellent compared to my Samsung galaxy 3.
Upgraded from an evo 3d and I think it is a good phone. I had the evo for four years and had great luck with it so I decided to stay with HTC for this reason. does everything I would expect it too and loads things quicker than my last phone and the battery life is great. It is a little big and does not fit well in one hand. Other than that I love the phone.
thank you
Love it!!
Excellent

Awesome, gallery features my favorite
Amazing and battery life is on point
I love this phone so far! It's quite large but I feel more productive using it. Youtube looks great. My pictures have a slight pixelation though the camera is supposed to be 13mp. Maybe it's just something I need to adjust with the settings. Other than that I love it! You can find some great phone cases on here as well. Enjoy!
The best phone I ever had! Fast, Reliable, HUGE, great camera. It's like having a slightly smaller tablet. I've had it for about 4 months and have had no issues at all with it. Battery lasts so much longer than any other smart phone too. So worth the $200 I spent on it. If you can get it for less, GET IT.
love it!
Love it!
muy bien

decent!!

nice fit
good buy
Phone seems alright until you make or receive a phone call, then sound quality is absolutely horrible. So much static that you cannot hear the call. Tried using speaker, the blue tooth and headphone jack, but call quality is equally bad in all modes. Phone is essentially unusable for actual phone calls.
I bought this beautiful phone, but when the messenger arrived I realized that does not work outside the US and product specifications do not say .. I will return the phone, but I also want a refund of RD $ 2,800.00 00 my Courier billed to give back to the cell Amazon. It is an equivalent of US $ 65.00
fast nice just what i wanted....
Amazing phone!!! Speed size wow
I'm so in love with this phone

Like the phone a lot.  This phone replaces the HTC evo 4 g.  The screen, and sound are superb and it is very fast.  I am suprised at how good my battery life is.  To my suprise I was impressed with how easy it was to convert my data from the evo to the desire 816.
Badass phone for  the price!
Was just looking to replace my older phone with any android that had newer software, I was happy with the price until I got the phone in the mail......I never looked at the dimensions of this thing, I was amazed! After that the price was awesome!!!
This is a great buy! However, this IS NOT a Virgin Mobile Phone its a UNLOCKED PHONE!!! Its a dual sim card phone Straight Talk or another sim card will have to be used to activate it. I took it to two places yesterday, both Sprint and Virgin Mobile dealers (which is Boost Mobile here in Michigan who deals with and sells Virgin Mobile Phones) DID NOT want to deal with it! Sprint flat out was rude, and the Boost Mobile dealer could not transfer my old HTC to this HTC, because the HTC Desire 816 here in the picture is not a Virgin Mobile Phone! Its a unlocked phone. So with everyone saying its a Virgin Mobile phone, it is not, or they may have received a different version than I. All I know is...is that its a great buy, and I am glad I purchased it, however, buyer beware, its not a Virgin Mobile compatible phone. Its a UNLOCKED DUAL SIM PHONE! Five stars hands down, if you don't mind changing carriers to Straight Talk or another brand of sim card its a terrific buy.
Great!
thanks
Awsome
Very nice tablet phone.
No problem with delivery, was delivered as promised. Unfortunately I will be returning the phone due to constant freezes and constantly overheats. These are hardware problems and do not reflect on seller
Its a pretty good fun but the battery life is just terrible and their is not enough space on the phone. If your buying this phone please make sure you get your a 32-64 GB SD card to be safe.
Great
Nice.
love the phone but it wont let me share post on facebook keeps telling me there is an error and I cant save anything on my SD card and to download an app I have to delete other ones.
This is hands down the best phone I've ever had.. Not only is it a great price but the service is wonderful and inexpensive. I've had all the latest phones but this is amazing💋❤👌
Would be great if it came with a phone case or screen protector as if you drop this 5 inches to the ground depending on the angle it will crack the screen. Otherwise great phone
Sim card included?
Good phone but limited memory and screen cracks really easy. Had it for a few months before it busted pretty bad,  kept it for a few more months,  then traded for sg6.
Unfortunately the phone was horrible! Could only make calls.  Unable to connect with network. Dropped Virgin mobile and went with another carrier. Was a total waste.
The phone I received takes way too long to charge and loses it's charge very quickly. I love the phone but I have to swap it out for another one with a good battery.
I have had alot of experience with cell phones, and this one is jsut fantastic.  Battery life is great, it doesn't freeze up at all, its a solid running performer.
Loved this phone until the SIM card fell out. Turns out this is an issue with this phone. cheaper to buy new phone than take to shop to fix sim card spot
I am really enjoying this phone!!.. 👍👍😀it is a super awesome phone steel learning more about it I just purchase a case for it loving it! loving it!..
Love this phone.
Good phone but virgin mobile is probably the absolute worst service I've ever had
Good
The best thanks
I like the phone. However, having never dropped or abused it within a month it no longer works and apparently I can not return it. RIP OFF!
I like the phone is all I can say at this point as I have not had it long. Time will tell  it is thin and very light the price is a plus.
I can't put this phone down. Lightning fast HTC has out done themselves on this one. 10 times better than all others I've owned.
32 days after having this phone in my possession the LCD just goes out and I have never dropped the phone it's a piece of crap
It very good, awesome phone,  but there are two problems<br/>Auto rotate slowly<br/>Unavailable with the Sim card
I loooooove this phone. only had it for a day lol. I had to downgrade from the HTC one m8 to this Phone and it's just the same! Except the m8 is of course better but for the price of this one it's GREAT! and it's works and looks and sounds wonderful. Just don't really like what the backs made of. I've always been a biggg fan of HTC phones !! And I love virgin mobile also! Best company out there to me! Get this phone lol (:
7.60 GB of the 8 my phone offers is filled with "other" data and I can't save photos or download apps.
A++
Awesome😊😊
Phone didn't even last 2 months before the display shorted out and died. Very pretty paper-weight though.
Screen broke in thirty-three days. I did not drop my phone once. I received a phone call and the phone worked fine. I put the phone in my pocket, got in my car, and drove for thirteen minutes. When I got out of my car, I checked my phone and the screen was exploding in lines of primary colors. I am (understandably, I think) upset.
I'm wanting to know if this phone has a matte finish in the whole phone, or is it glossy?
Excellent product and very happy with the expririence, better than buying from China.
Amazing phone it's better than Samsung galaxy s 3 I would buy again. Love this phone.
i cant unlock this fone...and i cant return it too..i bought it for use in Ghana
I have had this phone for <4 months and it has completely died on me. Didn't drop, no damage to the phone but it no longer charges, will not turn on and is now a ~$200 paper weight. Was a great phone, but for would expect to last more than <4 months before it became useless.
It's ok sometimes the phone acts up then I have to turn it off then back on
After three months the power button got stuck and will not pop back out!!
I love this phone it is grate if your thinking about buying it go for it
No access to battery.<br/>No SD card.<br/>Love the phone!<br/>Highly recommended!
Great phone for the price. Nothing about the phone so far that I can find that I don't like.<br/><br/>The phone did come with an amazing amount of bloatware.... Like holy shet! About half of its internal memory is already taken so don't forget to some extra.
I love this phone .it's big loud and awesome. Best phone I've ever had!
Phone is great fit for me. Large screen, great sound and nice camera.
the phone doesn't work that good but that's all I have to use so
sweet phone.  had it for a few months and no problems at all...
The phone is so nice but I order a unlocked phone and it's not
I really love this phone. It's the best phone I've ever owned.
I love this phone it is way better than I expected thanks!!!!!
My boyfriend ordered this phone. He loves it. It works great!
the phone crapped out just before the 4 month mark. Now I cant return or replace through Amazon! this sucks! Not even the manufacturer can  replace since there is no serial # available. phones through Amazon horrible
Excellent phone very happy....would highly recommend it...
This its the best phone I never had very good batery life
Unacceptable Performance.  This phone failed after 5 months.  It was ordered in December 2014 and failed in May 2015.  It stopped transmitting voice and hence, no one can hear anything at the other end.
Great phone and got it at a great price through amazon!
Great phone, nice and big, unlike IPhone, runs great!
Some reason my voice is not working on the turn by turn on my maps
I love the phone everything about it is flawless !!!
Got this for my mom and she loves it. Great phone.
Can i use this phone with a Mexican phone company?
Great
I love this phone and what a great price.
Love it. And did not even receive it yet.
Stopped working day after i received it!
BUY THIS PHONE! it's such a great phone.
Excellent phone. Virgin mobile is great.
Iove this phone its amazing and very big
Love it! Received just as described!
The phone if great but service sucks
Does everything that I need it to.
VERY satisfied. Works really well.
The best phone for less than 200
I wanted to give this 5 stars because the phone itself is outstanding But there is one big drawback for me.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>- Awesome 720p screen. The colors are vibrant and the blacks are very dark. Awesome.<br/><br/>- Great call quality. I am coming from the LG Optimus F3, and people say I sound amazing now and they can clearly understand me.<br/><br/>- Boom Sound. The main reason I bought this phone. I HATED having to cup my hand behind my phone or tablet so I could barely hear it. This thing So awesome. I can hear it clearly over 2 23 inch fans and a 10,000 BTU air conditioning unit that's within 3 feet of my bed. Such an awesome feature, I don't know why every company doesn't do this.<br/><br/>- LTE. This is not the same thing as the 4G on the F3. This is blazing fast. 36Mbps+.<br/><br/>- No stuttering once I changed runtime to ART under dev options. Blazing fast, handles everything I've thrown at it.<br/><br/>- So much more to day but I am lazy. If you have any questions feel free to post here and ask, I'll be happy t... Read more
I love it!!! Can't put it down!
Awesome phone I love it a lot.
Duel speakers made for good sound quality. Like other posters have said the slot for the SIM card would not hold the sim card in place and thus you get no LTE signal and a constant error message. It went bad after the return period for "shipped by amazon sold by shopcelldeals". Amazon offered to take it back anyway after contacting them about not finding any contact information (email or phone) for shopcelldeals to get warranty information being the phone was less than 90 days old. Thumbs up too Amazon. But I contacted Virgin mobile while waiting for a response from amazon, and virgin mobile honored the warranty with a (refurbished phone i am sure) from another manufacture being they no longer sell the HTC desire 816 them selves. VM also said the bad sim slot was a common problem. I liked my old HTC EVO 3D but bought the desire because the EVO was not LTE, but WIMAX which was never in my area. The Desires 816 LTE speed was a big improvement over Evo's 3G while it lasted.
pretty good 'little' phone
My teenage daughter wanted this phone.. Enough to switch from her iphone to Android. I really wish that the warranty option had displayed more prominent when I was purchasing this phone. One week after purchase the phone was dropped, and the screen is severly cracked. We have dropped other phones worse and no problems. Yes, this new phone had a case on it. Since it was my childs only birthday gift, I took it to a cell repair shop to replace the screen. We were told (by two shops) that the phone is too new and screen replacements aren't available yet. I wondered if the larger size of the phone / screen would compromise the integrity against "life" happenings.. The perks of the phone seem good, just not happy with how easy the screen cracked. Now stuck with the "band aid fingers" until I can order parts or afford to replace the phone.
Great android for the price. I traded in my galaxy s3 for this and love it.
Great product and price
Love my HTC 816 desire
This was a gift, so while I'm not using it, I hear it's a great phone!
This is a great phone
It is an awesome case
Love love love it!!!!
PERFECT PHONE FOR ME
Better than expected
highly recommended!!
Couldn't be happier.
No charger included
Works as advertised
Love this phone !
Love the phone, best purchase I ever made on Amazon(:
Love this phone.
I was really looking forward to getting this phone but after only 2 days of having it, it crashed. It took 5 hours to reboot. SMH  Very disappointed. But while I had it it was a very nice phone, quick to upload and download and all the apps launched quickly. The sound was awesome both for calling and music and the 13 mp camera took great pics. The phone has potential and was probably a lemon so I will give it another try. (holding breath) So i will give it a mediocre score of 2 stars for now.
Excellent phone
nice cell phone
Excellent tanks
Love this phone
Love my phone!
Awesome phone!
Honestly, I was excited to get this phone. I saw some many great reviews/videos over this phone. Storage wasn't a big deal for me since I have SD cards already. Once I got this phone I wasn't going to immediately put service until next paycheck, and it came in a Virgin Mobile box but the SLIM SLOT says Sprint? Also one thing that makes me regret getting this phone is the horrible battery life. It dies so quickly! In ten minutes it went down 10!?!
Just 5 stars.
HTC Desire 816 is great phone, I love it
Listen don't hate on my review because it has to deal with negatives about the phone, and it's my honest opinion. Okay I work in a tough environment where the phone is always in my pocket and I'm always bending over to pick stuff up and what not. YOU DON'T NOT want this phone if you work in a tough environment. One you don't have a case, and the constant bending over and getting back up puts pressure on the phone which WILL cause hardware to go bad. No doubt about it, it's got everything you need in a phone, love everything in it but hate that you can't find an otterbox for it. It even dials 911 by itself in my pocket, bluetooth comes on by itself, screen lights up without me even touching the side button. And everytime I go to plug it into my car it starts talking and will stop playing music. Really stupid sad situation. Has been a horrible experience for me. In my honest opinion a galaxy s3 would be better for rough environments because you can actually get an otterbox for it. I've been through 6-7 smartphones I know the ins and outs of these things. Really fast for sure. If you work in an office I wouldn't see why it would be a bad phone.
son love it
Great phone
This phone is fine - the screen is great, the camera is nice, I haven't had a chance to try a phone call yet. But I have one complaint - It's f**king HUGE! I knew it was big, but I didn't expect it to be this big! I have tiny hands, and I can barely hold it. I'm going to see if I can get used to it. If not, I'll be replacing it with the Galaxy S3.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Bumping it up to 4 stars, since I've gotten used to the size of the phone. It's still a little unwieldy - it's a lot more convenient to use headphones than to hold the phone up to my face during a call, for example - but the phone is amazing enough otherwise that it pretty much makes up for it. The speakers are AWESOME. I cannot overstate how great the speakers are. I would recommend this phone. It's probably the best option in this price range.
My charger worked for  2 days 😠
Great phone feature and performance wise but the specs claims to have gorilla glass which it does not. If anything it's weaker than regular glass. The screen cracked first time I dropped the phone 2 weeks after I got it which I'm highly upset about because the claim to have gorrilla glass was a major factor in my decision to buy the phone.
very happy
Very good
Probably one of the worst phones I have ever had the speakers are blown the storage is absolutely awful and the camera is supposed to be really great and it is so hard to get to focus to take a picture that is not blurry and the flash makes the pictures red .
Its good
Phone broke after 1 month.  Has to be sent back to HTC for repair. Side button sticks and phone shuts itself off. Pictures are blurry. Had galaxy s3. Definitely a down grade.
Love it
it's ok
Love it
love it
Awesome
The reason that bought the phone was to listen to sermons that I had on an SD card. For some reason the phone wouldn't play all of the sermons. I removed the SD card, inserted it into my old phone and it worked just fine.
Screen cracked too easily. I enjoyed the phone while it worked for a few months. I put it in my back pocket and the entire phone bent which shattered the screen. I put my iphone 6 back there all the time and have never had a problem. I'm pretty careful in general and have never cracked or even chipped any of my phone screens before. In my mind, the cost is not worth the trade for the lack of durability.
good
The 8gb version of this phone leaves you with 1 GB of free space. I've had the phone for one day and it's already full.
I just bought this and from what Ive read its a good phone I'm glad with my purchase I give it 5 stars
5 start seller, but I returned the item ( not user friendly )........purchased iPhone instead
Fast shipping, great price, excellent condition, love this phone
I had it for 2 days, it wouldn't connect to the network. I updated the software and it shut off, then would never turn on again. It also shut off at random times when I did have it on.
Very helpful when I had a problem with the device. thank you
This phone preforms as advertized.  Love the size.
want to know if the phone is compatible with net10
Love it! Probably more phone than I need though.
Good phone take nice pic and very fast internet
So I usually wait a little while before i write a review so i can really test the product and not give misinformation. I bought this phone as an upgrade from the desire 610. I have owned the phone for a week.<br/><br/>I love the design of the phone. It has what appear to be laser cut buttons for power/volume. The speaker holes also appear to be in a laser cut fashion but on plastic. Yes the back cover is glossy and a fingerprint magnet. If you use a cover you will never see that problem!<br/><br/>The display is a 720p display but it is crisp. It is not pixelated and i can't tell the difference from a 1080p display next to it. It is a bigger phone, and thus it makes you give up 1 handed browsing but trades off with more viewing space on the 5.5 inch screen.<br/>The speakers are above standard and have a slightly premium sound to them. Thanks to HTC's boomsound?<br/><br/>The overall performance of the phone is exceptional. I have not experienced any sort of lag or jitter.<br/>The phone sports a 5mp front and 13mp rear camera. The stock camera app has greatly improved by adding a feature that allows you to save customized/personalized camera modes. The front facing camera seems to take exceptional selfies although i don't personally use front cameras. This is where things fall kind of short. Although it is a 13MP camera, taking good shots seems to be a hassle. The picture quality is very good if you get a good shot. It is somewhat difficult to get a good shot because the camera has a slightly slow shutter speed. This means you will get motionblur when you're trying to take pics on the fly or if you have shaky hands like me.<br/>-Id like to add that the fingerprint magnet on the back cover also applies to the lens. I have to continuously wipe the lens everytime i need to take a pic. Otherwise, the camera "glows"<br/><br/>The battery is my single biggest complaint.. I tend to use my phone lightly to moderately. I primarily use it for data over actual phone calls. I don't game or use any cpu intensive apps. It is barely getting me by my 8hr shift at work and i have it on power saver mode the whole time! Being new and fresh out of the box i would've expected a little longer run time. I can only assume what the near future holds for me; dead batteries and a daily charger in my pocket.
question is it really virgin mobile
This phone is not as good as it could be.  First, the power and volume buttons are on the wrong side. When it's in a case and propped up for viewing or listening, the buttons are faced down not convenient to adjust.  The HTC operating system is so confusing and bad, I will never want to buy an HTC phone again.<br/>With the forward facing speakers you think that you would have more control over sound settings.....you don't.<br/>The home screen buttons are placed on the touch screen making it confusing if you want to access them while watching video, playing a game, or anything else. I have even accidentally hit the home button while typing this review.  It's very frustrating!  Not a great idea from HTC.  Overall, the phone screen is large, but it isn't any good on the face of this waste of money. I've used this phone for three months to try and get used to it before I wrote this.  I do not recommended this phone to anyone.  My teenage daughter doesn't even want it.  Get the LG Volt.
mi bought one of these from another website perfect phone but the battery sucks<br/>you charge it and by 4 hours even if you dont use it it will drain<br/>i loved the phone but the battery killed me 😖😔
good deal / thanks
Loving it so far
So far so good.
Great phone!!!
Great phone!
Great phone
Best phone
i love it!
This product is awful. I need to know how to return it, the camera is horrible. Think of an old 2001 flip phone camera quality and it would compare. I picked this because of the 13 megapixels , which appears to be false. Codnt be more unhappy.
Bad sound quality.. very tin can sounding when in a call.<br/><br/>Biggest screen I've had, great look and light weight.
Description in the website never mentioned it as cdma mobile I wasted 10 days of my life by buying and returning
Very nice high five! My name a borat son of Asimov, is a nice how much? Little. Quality of the finest caliber, sexy time look! You get the box too very nice for shit. This case is NOT black.
Do you have to use virgin mobile with this phone
Good phone great seller, highly recommended.
I would love to rate the phone, if I would have received the correct device.
Horrible phone with even worse customer service! I bought this phone to use as a Virgin Mobile phone, which I would like to say is a fantastic company and has nothing to do with the horrible experience that HTC has provided me. Within the first two weeks of owning this phone the power button broke. It is not too fun to have a phone that restarts randomly. However it was under warranty so all was not lost. After two weeks a fixed phone was returned, however it was set up to have Sprint as the provider, making the phone unusable for Virgin Mobile. We have been told by customer service that this is as simple to fix as giving us an activation code. However we are now going on a month and half of fighting with customer service and being told " we will have a technician call you in 24 hours". HTC is a horrible company and a little bit of research will show you how many people have similar stories as mine. Please be smart and do not buy a HTC phone especially if you have Virgin Mobile as your provider.
Love it
The display was great. The size was somewhat unwhieldy. I never got a chance to get used to it because the display failed before I had a chance to make a phone call.
This phone is amazing. it's fast big and loud so glad I got it I would recommend this to anyone who basically wants a tablet but can use it as a phone 😊
The phone is amazing! Big good looking screen, nice camera, fast, no lag. It's perfect! But my power button is broken after 3 days, so I returned it.
Phone only lasted me 3 months cuz the from facing speckers blew and the 13mp camera broke when I dropped it so the looked super blurry
This may be the greatest phone, but the Virgin Mobile service and customer service is horrid.  They do not do what they are supposed to.  Impossible to change payment account on-line, must make phone call, etc., etc.,  I am out $379 because of their customer service not doing what they were supposed.  At first they even said I had not calledl them and then suddenly they come up with information--amazing.  Can't make calls from home, roams and runs battery down, etc. etc.  Find a better carrier--might be cheap, but just not worth it.
Wonderful love the phone
I like the looks of the phone but can't use it because some idiot put a sticker over the numbers on the box that I need to activate it I carefully tried to remove it but of course it pulled # with it thanks idiot I hope your not making more than min wage and you don't even deserve that
I've been a little disappointed in this phone. I came from Galaxy and feel it was much easier and more convenient. The battery life seems to be longer and that's a plus.
Excelent
Phone Get Very Hot And Take Forever To get Fully Charged Would Not Recommended Purchase To Worst Enemy!!!!
I want to send back this phone I didn't realize it can't work on GSM network and it's not unlock.
Not as vibrant as expected and the print began to peel as soon as I touched the case! Waste of money!!
It is a good phone.
I took it last year it's just like iPod if you are from different network it only works with virgin.I am very disappointed
Not as goood as the reviews i read, my galaxy s3, i should have stayed with...
Not a very good case at all. More like a sleeve.
Was not as described, returned it.
Pretty good phone, for the price and are getting a lot of value. The only complaints I have with the phone is that the camera/video both are horrible and the 8  of memory space is horrible. You have about 4GB of memory due to the fact there there's a whole bunch of bloatware on the phone that you cannot delete. Only buy this phone if you're on a budget. Otherwise the screen is great, and the resolution is decent. On second thought, yeah don't buy this phone
If I could give less than a star I would. Received my phone fast (because I paid to). But that's about as good as this review goes. Took the phone out of the package and charged it until it was at 100%. Turned it on and..... Nothing. Stayed on the HTC screen. In fact it has been two days and it is still on the HTC screen. Tried everything but it won't work.<br/>Defective. Crap. And now I'm out $200.
Bought this phone 2 weeks ago and was unaware it only had 8 gb..I have already filled this up and I need a lot more space, I don't have hardly any music, and only have about 200 pics. Is there any way to expand the gigs on this so I can keep it instead of returning it? Please help!!!! Thanks!
The phone is fine,but the LED notification lights don't work.I called HTC,did all there tests,still nope.
I'm not a big smartphone person, so all I can really say is: It's a little larger than is practical.
Nothing as described enforces wrinkles and dents into face
The amount of phone storage sucks
5 star phone, but it has 1 star glass screen. Breaks VERY easily. Screen broke after a single drop and then any slight pressure completely shattered screen. Actual phone is amazing comparing to the Galaxy line up, LG G series, and iPhones.
Had this phone for about 3 days started noticeing the notification light glitch blinking like it was broke. And very much is, really disappointed!!! Really liked the phone but this glitch is bugging me i just ugh DISAPPOINTED ALL I CAN SAY
a brand new htc 816 would not answer voice calls consistently....it would bring up one of two different answer screens...one had reject and answer under lines....this screen would work...the other showed an phone icon above answer and something above reject...the screen would not answer of reject the call.  so I essentially had a phone of no real use.  I am returning it for refund and for refund of the accessories I will no longer need.  So, most of those refunds will be eaten up by the return postage fees.  I cannot comprehend how the phone would use two different screens to answer incoming calls...and especially why one would not work at all.  Virgin Mobile tried to troubleshoot the problem, including doing factory default reset, but to no avail.  I bought this phone because of the great reviews on Amzaon.com web page.  I'm beginning to wonder if the reviews are real.  However, I have learned my lesson:  I will make all future purchase at stores ...where I can return defective items (not usually a problem)  ....but HTC SEEMS TO HAVE ENGINEERED A "NIGHTMARE" PHONE. I WOULD GIVE IT A LOWER RATING THAT ONE STAR, BUT IT'S NOT AVAILABLE TO DO SO.
Kinda blows man... Screen is shattered.
not free phone is locked for use outside usa
Completely disappointed that we could Not Unlock this phone. The phone itself was very nice.
Piece of GARBAGE!  OMG, I don't even know if I can list everything wrong with this waste of money!  First, I had to call HTC support to get help with the phone reverting back to the original settings all the time....not just on one phone, but the replacement phone as well!<br/><br/>The touch screen sucks, as I pretty much have to use a hammer to hit the screen with in order for it to "take" touching an app or "button".<br/><br/>If I am done with a phone call, it takes FOREVER for it to hang up! One day I kept hearing a voice and could not figure out where it was coming from.  About an hour later I checked my phone for messages and saw that the stupid piece of crap phone never hung up from my previous call!!!  I had to pretty much HIT the "end call" button for it to end the call!<br/><br/>The camera is all screwed up!  The list of problems with the camera on this piece of crap are just too numerous to put on here.<br/>Renaming a pic or video used to be easy with one touch of an option, now you have to spend 5 minutes, going through SO MANY options, to get to the point where you can rename a pic or video!<br/><br/>I turn the volume/sound off when I'm at work, but yet, I still hear it ring or ping or make sounds when getting calls/texts/emails!!!<br/><br/>I like the big screen, but it's TOO big to handle in one hand.....and I have big hands!<br/><br/>This phone is made for left handed people, not right handed people.<br/><br/>I HATE the way it lists photos, and cannot get it to list photos in any other way!  VERY annoying and useless.<br/><br/>VERY difficult to find anything on this phone, in the ways of editing features and turning features off and on.  Instead of one place, they are scattered "all over".  Nothing is where it should be.<br/><br/>A complete waste of money!!!!!!
Itz good but I didn't use it yet
not working well in saudi arabia
This phone is SUPER FAST!! BUUUUUTTTT it only has 8GB and you can only use 1GB because of BLOATWARE!!! Thats sucked for me so I ROOTED it thinking I could use an app called LinktoSD...its a great app but after 2 days of rooting..the longest and hardest root I've ever done and it took 2 10 hour days ...it didnt work!!! This phone gave me nothing but space issues!! Then I sold it on Ebay for $100 and shipped it from Charlotte to Hickory NC and it got lost in the mail!!! Really so its been 3 weeks and my phone never went to the buyer and I have to give a refund!! These phones are cursed!!!! LOL
Phone felt cheap and flimsy, probably the reason for the broken/cracked LCD under the glass. Have a replacement coming and will write a review after I actually have time to use it.
