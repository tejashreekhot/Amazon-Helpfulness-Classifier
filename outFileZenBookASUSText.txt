░░░░░UM, WOW!!!!░░░░░<br/><br/>͡° ͜ʖ ͡°<br/><br/>Let me just say that I have researched just about every device sold in the United States that has a 13 inch screen in my quest to replace my dying laptop. It's been a thoroughly exhaustive search. But the search is now over! I've tested every device from Chromebooks to Mac Books to giving up and just reading a book. The Zenbook is where my quest ends!<br/><br/>I just got my Zenbook tonight and it has been a great experience right from the unboxing. I'll start with the packaging because it deserves mentioning. The Amazon box was huge, the size of a VCR from 1981. Inside that was a plain box for the Zenbook about the size of 1995 VCR. Inside that box was a very nice fancy box about the size of a board game box. That box was well cushioned inside the 1995 VCR box. Inside that was the Zenbook. So the thing ships VERY well protected from drops by the delivery service. I have never been impressed by packaging much, but this one managed to do it.<br/><br/>Once I got the machine turned on I tried Windows 8 for the first time.........and 5 minutes later I learned how well the Classic Shell app works to make Windows look normal. I originally intended to put Ubuntu on it as I'm a Linux fan, but with Classic Shell Windows 8.1 has been working great and I've opted to keep it on there for the 6 weeks since I bought the system. It's very stable and the 'instant on' feature is awesome.<br/><br/>Now the hardware....<br/><br/>░░░░░DISPLAY░░░░░<br/><br/>❖ The screen is great. I mean really great. It's a matte finish which REALLY cuts down on glare. I am sitting with a bright light directly behind me as I write this and while it's lighting up the screen, I don't see any reflection of the light at all. When I hold my phone at the same angle as my screen I can't see a thing on the phone screen (normal glossy smartphone screen).<br/><br/>❖ The resolution is fantastic, and even with the native display settings maximized for the HD screen resolution all the text is big enough to read comfortably. (You can mess with the scaling and text size if need be, but the text is not super tiny right off the bat like some other HD screens are)<br/><br/>❖ The bezel around the screen looks much bigger in the picture at the top of this page. It's really not that big and the actual LCD panel fills the screen area well.<br/><br/>❖ There is a rubber gasket all the way around the outer edge of the bezel that will do 2 things. It will keep the metal screen housing from rubbing against the metal keyboard housing and scratching them both up. It will also provide some (I said SOME) protection against water getting in if the lid is closed. This might come in handy if the Zenbook is in a backpack and you get caught in the rain. It's not waterproofing. It's "buy you 20 seconds to run inside" protection.<br/><br/>❖ The issue with the back of the lip lifting the machine up a little when the screen is opened all the way....yeah...that's a thing. But I don't think it's an accident. First off it sits stable and doesn't move around when the system is leaning on the back of the lid. Second this causes the keyboard to angel up at your slightly. It's subtle, but I like it.<br/><br/>░░░░░KEYBOARD░░░░░<br/><br/>❖ Prior to today I've been using 2 keyboards regularly. A Dell Latitude D630 notebook keyboard that is full size with normal laptop keys, and a full size normal desk top keyboard with big keys. Both have 'normal' key travel. The Zenbook is my first island key set up. It took me about 8 seconds to get used to it. The key travel isn't as deep as my Dell Latitude keyboard, but it's not much more shallow. It's very easy to type on.<br/><br/>❖ The Power button being above the backspace key and built into the keyboard seems to be a big issue with a lot of people. I type like The Thing from the Fantastic Four (Big dude made of orange rock) so I have already used the backspace key a lot in the last 2 hours. I haven't hit the power button yet. I also think it gives the whole system a nice clean look that there isn't a row of system buttons above the function key row.<br/><br/>❖ The trackpad. Yes, it clicks a little when you tap it. Yes, it was annoying for the first hour. I got used to it as soon as I realized it wasn't broken. It dose that because the whole trackpad is a clickable button. So there is play in the trackpad. It's not loud. It's not wiggling loose. It's just not a big deal.<br/><br/>░░░░░SPEAKERS░░░░░<br/><br/>❖ The speakers are on the bottom. To be more specific they are on the very sides of the bottom and angled slightly out toward the sides. They aren't full size JBL tower speakers that will wake up the neighbors, but they aren't trying to be. They are laptop speakers. They get the job done. Even being on the bottom I found them to be plenty loud enough to hear the sound of YouTube videos (The Force Unleashed trailer looks and sounds great on this. That was my test video. It was.....good times.) The speakers probably aren't loud enough to let you watch a movie in a crowded room...but if you're trying to do that the odds are you've got headphones anyway. The speakers are perfectly capable laptop speakers.<br/><br/>░░░░░INTERNAL GEEKY STUFF░░░░░<br/><br/>❖ I can't slow this system down. I've thrown all my normal usage stuff at it (Office, web browsing...with multiple java heavy tabs, watching videos, etc etc) and I can't slow it down. The 8GB of RAM is more than enough for 95% of users. Maybe it wouldn't make a great video editing machine, but the vast majority of the world isn't even going to do that. If you're doing resource intensive stuff you know you need a bigger more powerful machine and you're probably not looking at this one.<br/><br/>❖ The 256 SSD drive is amazing. When it says fast access it's not screwing around. It boots fast, wakes from sleep fast, and accesses files fast. This is all because the SSD storage lets the system quickly save and retrieve data. If you're a computer person you understand what I'm saying. If you're not, trust me. It's awesome.<br/><br/>░░░░░LOOK AND FEEL░░░░░<br/><br/>❖ It's thin. Like crazy thing. Look at the pictures below comparing it to my Dell Latitude D630, which in it's day was a pretty tiny and very portable notebook. My Dell now suddenly feels like my old 8088 desk top from 1987. The keyboard part is the same thickness as my Samsung Galaxy S4 phone. With the lid closed the whole system is just a hair thicker than my Galaxy Tab 2 tablet. You hear what I'm saying? This nicely powered ultrabook computer is basically as thin as a very nice smartphone. That's insane to me.<br/><br/>And it doesn't feel flimsy as a result. I was worried it would feel like I was going to break it in half because it's so thin. It feels pretty strong and sturdy. The all aluminum frame just feels expensive. (I mean the Zenbook isn't cheap, but it's not priced like a Mac Book either.)<br/><br/>❖ It's also very light. This is a double edged sword. The ONLY thing that's even remotely an issue with the Zenbook. When sitting on your lap the system bounces around as you type a little bit. It just doesn't have enough mass to keep it firmly planted on your lap. It's not a big deal, but it's noticeable compared to my heavy 2007 Dell notebook. One the flip side, its ULTRA portable. It can sit on my lap all day and it'll never start to get heavy.<br/><br/>❖ It's quiet. Dead quiet. Ninjas could check their email in the middle of a mission and it wouldn't give them away.<br/><br/>❖ It's cold. It doesn't get warm. I've been using it for about 90 minutes straight now and it's cold to the touch. The aluminum body does a great job of dissipating the small amount of heat the builds up.<br/><br/>░░░░░THE FINAL VERDICT░░░░░<br/><br/>❖ Buy it.<br/><br/>░░░░░UPDATE !!! (AFTER 3 MONTHS OF USE)░░░░░<br/><br/>❖ I've had my Zenbook for 3 months now and still absolutely love it just as much as the day I first got it. Nothing has 'worn thin' on me or made me change me initial opinions of the Zenbook. I absolutely love it and am very happy that this is the machine I ended up buying after all my research. I use it every day and it's fantastic. The battery is wonderful after 3 months of real world use. I charge it about every 3rd day usually, maybe every other day if I use it a lot. I've yet to burn the battery down completely in a single day. (To be fair I haven't watched any movies on it or anything. That will burn the battery down faster)
Recently purchased the UX305FA and it arrived yesterday. Keep in mind this is a very preliminary review as I've had the laptop for less than 24 hours. I plan to update this review as I use it more. Feel free to ask questions and I'll try to respond. I'm going to try to be as objective as possible here and point out pro's and con's that might affect everyone, not just my own preferences.<br/><br/>The good:<br/>-Size: This baby is thin!! I keep seeing publications reference it somewhere in the 12-13mm range. I have no idea how to use the metric system. This translates to roughly half an inch thin. It's also very light, tipping the scales at a minuscule 2.5lbs.<br/>-Noise: Or I should say, a lack of noise. The CPU has no fan, the hard drive is solid state, and there is no optical drive - meaning this computer essentially has no moving parts. It's strange using a machine that's totally silent when you're not typing on it. I love it already.<br/>-Price: This device retails for $699. Amazing that they can sell it for this price. It seems unanimously accepted from reviewers that this is a good deal based on what this model offers and how it stacks up against similarly outfitted competition.<br/>-Construction, Fit, & Finish: It's made out of all aluminum. Has a very nice feel in your hands, inside and out. The color is kind of unique too. It has a deep stone color with the slightest hint of dark purple in it. In a sea of black and silver laptops, this one definitely stands out. The cover has the nice brushed concentric circle design inherent to the Zenbook line, and it's very pleasing to the eye. There are also some thoughtful design touches which pleasantly surprised me. The top panel which holds the laptop's screen has two tiny little rubber feet at the bottom. So when the machine is open, they prop up the laptop at the slightest angle toward the user. Asus really took some care into designing the hardware in this thing.<br/>-The charger: I don't think I've ever seen a charger this small for a laptop. It's awesome!! So small and light. Comparatively my last charger was the size of a Buick. Considering you'll probably be carrying the charger with the laptop frequently - it's great that it weighs so little. Keeps the entire experience of portability intact.<br/>-The keyboard: Typing on it feels nice. I don't feel cramped at all and the key travel is decent for a laptop that's very thin. Keystrokes don't seem loud to me. I like it.<br/>-Matte Display: I wanted a 1080P matte display with no touch screen, and that's what this model offers. This gives me the opportunity to use the laptop at coffee shops, on airplanes, or in different areas of my house without worrying about sunlight or reflections that might affect a glossy screen. Out of the box the text is crisp, brightness and colors seem fine. I will likely spend more time tweaking the settings to get the most out of it.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/>-No backlit keyboard: This personally doesn't bother me, as my last laptop also did not have a backlit keyboard. Many of my fellow reviewers seem to complain about this though. So I guess it's a desirable feature. Keep in mind that backlit keyboards are typically reserved for higher end machines in the $1000 range. Also if you know how to type properly, you shouldn't even be looking at the keys. Whatever, I don't think it's a big deal.<br/>-Power button location: Again, this doesn't bother me. But it is above the backspace key, and directly right of the delete key, so you can surmise it might be easy to accidentally turn the machine off. You can easily update what the power button does in Window's power settings. I changed it to "do nothing" so I won't make this mistake.<br/>-Backlight bleeding (LCD Screen): I noticed this immediately when I turned it on and saw the all-black boot-up screen with the Asus logo. This will vary from screen to screen, so you might end up with a unit that ends up being worse or better than mine. Might bother users that watch a lot of TV or movies, but to me it doesn't matter. This issue is common to LCD screens and not unique to Asus.<br/>-Speakers: I expected them to be under-powered, and they are. If you're buying a laptop for its speakers, don't shop for the one that's half an inch thin. There just isn't enough room for any really robust audio hardware here. Need better audio? Buy a pair of earbuds, or a bluetooth speaker, and the problem is solved.<br/>-Availability: At the time of this review, March 2015, you may have difficulty finding one at MSRP. Microsoft is sold out, and so is Amazon. If you want one at retail price, the only place I see selling at the moment is directly through the Asus website. Amazon third-party vendors also have this for sale, but they are inflating the price over MSRP. Don't let those fools con you into overpaying for something that should cost $699.<br/><br/>The ugly:<br/>The trackpad. Some people here seem to like it. I personally think it's crap. For a $700 device, quality needs to suffer somewhere and for me it's the trackpad. My previous computer was a 2008 HP that had a wonderful aluminum trackpad that had a great feel to it and worked perfectly. Seven years later, this new computer has a trackpad that's only about 90% responsive with scrolling/gestures. There are left and right mouse buttons integrated into the trackpad, and on my machine the clicks sound obnoxiously loud. It sounds cheap to me. Clicks and taps seem to register fine most of the time. To be honest I've seen and felt better trackpads on $200 Chromebooks. I've shopped for Asus Zenbook's line before, and subpar trackpad performance seems to be an issue inherent to the brand. Hopefully Asus will start reading customer comments and work on addressing this in future models. I personally solved this problem by buying a tiny wireless Logitech mouse which works great. I'm keeping the laptop, and I feel this is a minor point of contention on what is otherwise an all around great product.<br/><br/>The unknown:<br/>-Battery life: I haven't had the computer long enough to truly give a fair estimate on this. But I hope to report back. The sticker on the laptop said 10 hours, I doubt I will achieve that. Seems most users are reporting roughly 7 hours. After a full charge, I've been working on it for roughly two hours. The battery indicator says 71% and 7+ hours remaining. If that happens, I'll be content!<br/>UPDATE 3/21/15: On my first full charge I used the computer for two days. Over 4 hours on the first day, and 3 hours on the second. It might even be closer to 8 hours, but I charged it at around 15%. So I can confirm this computer will get at least 7 hours battery life on web browsing, typing, generic activities. That's plenty for me, but I'll admit I don't know how this compares to rival laptops. I have to do some more testing with it, but I would estimate 6-8 hours should be a reasonable average depending on how you use the device.<br/><br/>The verdict:<br/>I'm a very conscious consumer who spends a ton of time deciding on electronic purchases. I always read a ton of professional and customer reviews on products and try things out in person whenever possible. I carefully considered many options before pulling the trigger on the UX305. I had an impossible (maybe even unreasonable) list of demands for an Ultrabook purchase, and while no product is perfect this laptop came very close. My other considerations were the MacBook Air, the Dell XPS 13, and a few others. Ultimately I wanted a Windows machine. For the money, this model is really hard to beat for what it offers. At this price point, similarly equipped laptops are probably going to run $900-1000 at minimum or a lot more. Overall it is a quality machine that appears well engineered and constructed. I'm a white collar professional, a part-time graduate student, and also spend a lot of weekends on the road visiting friends out of town. I wanted something that offered reasonable computing power but would be easy to tote along with me everywhere. I've seen some professional publications ding this laptop for performance, and its Core M processor. If you're the average consumer using this for web browsing, light office work, watching some videos and want a high quality very portable laptop for less than $1000 I really don't think there's a better option. Very happy with my choice. Go purchase this now, if you can even find one.<br/><br/>UPDATE 5/5/2015: I've now had this machine and used it daily for about 7 weeks. I still love it and highly recommend it. I stand by all my previous comments when I initially wrote this review back in March 2015. I have a few more insights to share having spent more time with the product. To reiterate - I really love the portability of this thing, it's so light and easy to move around my house, or stuff it into a bag and take it with you. I recently used it on a flight from Philadelphia to San Francisco. On a full charge, I watched two feature length movies (about 2 hours each) with airplane mode turned on. I had 77% battery life remaining at that point - impressive! I've also noticed that even after being turned on for a few hours, the laptop does not generate much heat at all, which is great if you'll have it in your lap. The trackpad still sucks, and I avoid using it whenever I can. Two other drawbacks that are minor complaints, but still noticeable: fingerprints and display driver issues. A few folks mentioned that the materials used on this machine are prone to fingerprinting. I can affirm this is true, and if this bothers you, expect to be wiping off the laptop with a cloth on a regular basis - I find myself doing it. I've also noticed that occasionally the display driver will crash, and the screen goes black for 1-3 seconds. This may just be a Windows 8 issue, but I thought it might be worth mentioning. I haven't found a way to fix it.
Wow! Thoroughly impressed by this ultrabook. At $699, this is a steal. I've been using it for 1 day so far, so these are my first impressions.<br/><br/>TL;DR:<br/>At $699, this is a steal. Works great as a linux laptop. 10/10 machine.<br/><br/>Linux Compatibility - 9/10<br/>The first thing I did was remove Windows 8.1 and replace it with Linux. I currently am running Ubuntu 14.10. Everything has worked out of the box except for 2 minor things: the brightness control using the function key (fn+f5, fn+f6) and some text display issue. I solved the brightness control by installing xbacklight (sudo apt-get install xbacklight) and mapping xbacklight -dec 10 to the F3 key and xbacklight -inc 10 to the F4 key. Also, on occasion, the display of text messes up. This is usually fixed with by simply adjusting the size of the window. This may be caused by me installing themes and not using the default theme. I have also installed Cinnamon desktop environment and it works great. I am using the Unity de currently though.<br/><br/>There are no obvious power drains or inefficiencies using Linux on this machine. It also uses the SSD very well and starts up from cold in just a few seconds. Amazing!<br/><br/>Wi-Fi works perfectly right out of the box. No tweaking. No hassles.<br/><br/>Battery - 10/10<br/>The battery life is phenomenal. I have seen 7 hours of intense usage at varying brightness levels and my battery still has ~1 hour left.<br/><br/>Graphics - 10/10<br/>Graphics performance is great so far. Plays 1080p video exceptionally well. This 1080p screen is amazing.<br/><br/>Performance-10/10<br/>I am a web developer/programmer. I have set up my development environment and it handles everything easily, as expected. I frequently use 30 tabs on Google Chrome, multiple instances of IDEs (Sublime Text, WebStorm) and Terminal emulators as well. No problem for this machine. The machine does get warm at the back/bottom since there is no fan. The area where I rest my palms remains nice and cool. Therefore, it is not a big deal. Do note that I have not attempted photo/video editing yet, nor do I intend to.
Looking for a high quality small computer that runs Windows? Look no further. This small Asus laptop is a powerhouse in a tiny body and, from everything I've seen so far, is the ideal laptop for someone who is looking for a Windows-based laptop that is easy to travel with.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>- The weight - this thing is LIGHT! As a photography I regularly use a laptop that has a 17" screen so that I can best edit my photos. When I pick up my large laptop, after handling the Zenbook, it feels like a brick. At one point my 10 year old daughter was using one hand to hold the Zenbook and another to type - that is how light it is!<br/><br/>- The QUIET! Until the Zenbook I never realized how noisy my regular computer truly was. The fan running in my regular computer helps to keep it cool, which is a necessity when running photoshop, but it is definitely one of those small background noises that you tend to start to ignore after awhile. The moment I started using the Zenbook was when I realized how accustomed to my laptops fan noise I had become. When the manufacturer says the Zenbook is quiet, they weren't kidding!<br/><br/>- The accessibility. Most normal laptops take at least 20-30 minutes to set up the first time. The Zenbook took less than 10. In less than 10 minutes it was up and running, connected to the internet (and keep in mind my internet is fairly slow) and my Google desktop and information was transferred onto it. If you know how to run Windows 8.1, you'll be fine. If you don't, this may be a bit of a learning curve.<br/><br/>- The charging. This laptop charges faster than any laptop I've ever owned - it roughly charges in the same amount of time as my Kindle Fire does!<br/><br/>- The battery. For an experiment, we unplugged the Zenbook at 3 PM and started using it. I used it a bit, my husband did, my daughter and my son, without ever once plugging it back in. Sometimes we closed the lid and let it sleep, other times it was used for web-based gaming or internet browsing, or simply to listen to music. By 11 PM that night the Zenbook still had 31% battery. We were impressed.<br/><br/>- The look. This laptop looks beautiful. With it's sleek casing and the slim size, it simply looks impressive!<br/><br/>- The Bluetooth. Not every laptop comes with Bluetooth connectivity, but this little sweetheart does. We had it hooked up to our Bluetooth speakers very quickly, which is good because the speakers on the Zenbook aren't the greatest.<br/><br/>THE CONS:<br/><br/>- The battery. Unlike my regular laptop, the Zenbook seems to have an internal battery. While it holds it's battery charge most impressively, I wonder what will happen if the battery starts to die as it looks as though it can't be replaced easily.<br/><br/>- The case. As gorgeous as the casing is, it does tend to get fingerprint marks on it fairly easily. They're not hugely noticeable unless the lighting is right, but if you want your laptop looking pristine you'd definitely be wiping it down on a regular basis.<br/><br/>- The speakers. As with most laptops, this one comes loaded with Spotify. Unfortunately we weren't super impressed with the volume out of the Zenbook. The small speakers are on the bottom of the laptop, which actually took us a little bit of time to find because they're so small. As a family of audiophiles, we weren't hugely impressed with the volume of sound the Zenbook had, but the quality wasn't horrible - we just wish it could go a bit louder.<br/><br/>- The size. Now please note that we have not dropped, banged, or otherwise dinged up our Zenbook so I'm not sure how much it will hold up to being beaten around, but I can see how someone would worry that the size of the Zenbook would make it more delicate. I can say that the casing seems extremely sturdy, not flimsy at all, and it's my educated guess that it can easily put up with the rigors of everyday life.<br/><br/>THE VERDICT<br/><br/>As someone who has always had 15" or larger laptops, I am beyond impressed by the Zenbook. I absolutely adore the speed and efficiency of the Zenbook and was shocked to realize that I don't feel deprived by the 13" screen. While this isn't the laptop to get for someone who is into serious, hardcore gaming, nor someone who needs to edit photos using a program that takes up tons of your computers memory, this IS the ideal laptop for someone who wants to be able to take their laptop with them quickly and easily, and for anyone who wants a small, affordable laptop that is packing more than enough power for everyday projects underneath it's casing.
NOTE: There are a few comparisons to the 2015 Dell XPS 13 in here. I owned one for three weeks and returned it. Reasons why at www.jasondunn.com if you're curious.<br/><br/>A razor-thin and light (2.6 pound) ultrabook with 8 GB of RAM, a 256 GB SSD, a matte 1080p non-touch screen display, with an SD card reader...for $699 USD. WHAT?? I've never seen specs and design like that even come close to that price point. People pay $500 for thick, heavy, plastic laptop bricks.<br/><br/>Oh, and it's a 100% silent fanless design because it uses a Core M CPU (it runs stock at 800 mhz, hits 2 Ghz on turbo). It's a 5 watt part vs the 15 watts of power the Broadwell-U sucks down. So there's the catch: Intel must sell the Core M CPUs for pretty cheap to allow Asus to include all this hardware and hit that price point. Despite what I'd heard about Core M laptops being under-powered, I thought "What the hell, for $699, why not give it a try?".<br/><br/>The UX305F is shockingly good - it's easily the best "bang for the buck" of any laptop in memory. Asus hit it out of the PARK with this thing: you get a lot for your money. A few initial thoughts after having it for five days:<br/><br/>• The CPU was a big area of concern for me. The 800 mhz CPU bursts up to 1.8 Ghz whenever the CPU is asked to do pretty much anything more strenuous than accept typed input. This is enough CPU power for a lot of things. I noticed that the install of Office 365 took a fair bit longer than I was used to, as did the install of Lightroom. On the other hand, I was shocked that Lightroom 5.7 felt quite usable, even with the huge raw files off my D750. It feels maybe 25% slower than the Dell XPS 13 I had, but the Core M is absolutely faster than my HP Envy Spectre 14 running at a higher clock rate (and using way more power). Importing raw files and converting to DNG takes longer than expected though - some patience is required. This is not a powerful CPU, it's an incredibly energy efficient one given the performance you do get.<br/><br/>• There are some Web sites I'll hit with a bunch of scripts and ads - if I try to scroll immediately, there's a bit of a drag. I haven't done any A/B testing with the UX305 and my HP Envy Spectre, but it's worth pointing out.<br/><br/>• It's so lightweight, it's wonderful and easy to carry around my house. Feel like a large tablet. Love that.<br/><br/>• The 1080p screen, when set to 125% scaling, is very usable. Things were just too small for my eyes at 100%, but at 125% I've gotten used to it. And guess what? Very few of the irritating high DPI issues that pained me with the Dell XPS 13. The screen is matte, which is great, and I'm also fine having no touch screen on it. It's quite bright - in my home office I can leave it at 50% brightness and it's ideal. Not quite as bright as the XPS 13, but bright enough for my needs.<br/><br/>• The awesomeness of a perfectly silent laptop can't be overstated. It's just so...nice. And quiet. And nicely quiet.<br/><br/>• The speakers don't get very loud, but that doesn't surprise me. Something to be aware of though if you like to watch movies on your laptop.<br/><br/>• No backlight on the keyboard. I miss it, but I can live with it being a touch-typist.<br/><br/>• A bit of backlight bleeding on the screen, but it's only noticeable when I'm rebooting it. Might be noticeable on movie watching.<br/><br/>• After loading it up with all my files, I left it running overnight to complete all the indexing and various under-the-hood things Windows likes to do. I think all the pro reviewers should do the same thing to speed up the "break in" period.<br/><br/>• The keyboard is quite good. I'm seeing virtually no missed keystrokes, so Asus fixed the issues they had with the first Zenbook. I feel like I can type at full speed with solid accuracy. And I know I'll get better once I adapt to the keyboard.<br/><br/>• I dislike the fact that the power button is where I'd expect to hit the delete key (which is small and placed right next to the power button). I've already hit the power button once by mistake. Asus needs to put it away from the keyboard like Dell did.<br/><br/>• Battery life is really quite good. The drain of sleep mode is virtually non-existent - I can open the lid after 12 hours and the battery life is virtually the same. I've used it off and on all week and only charged it twice. I'm estimating I'm seeing 7-8 hours of usable battery life from it, and some of that is installing apps, which hits the system pretty hard. I need to use it for another week to get a full feel for battery life, but so far it's looking VERY promising! The excellent battery life combined with the silent running makes it feel a bit like I'm using a tablet, except it has a keyboard and runs Windows...<br/><br/>• Incredibly fast boot time - 5 seconds to the Windows login screen. Instant sleep and resume. Powers off very fast.<br/><br/>• About the only thing I really don't like about it so far is the trackpad. It's very "clunky". The left/right buttons take some force to click. I'm glad I discovered that the two-finger tap is right-click, so I don't need to click the physical button very often. I'd almost like to try one of these at retail to ensure the "clunk" is really normal - it seems a bit odd to me.<br/><br/>All in all? I'm quite impressed with this product and would recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable, pretty awesome laptop. But the CPU makes this an ill-fit for anyone who's into heavy video editing, animation, etc. And of course gaming is pretty much off the table except at very low resolutions (and older games).<br/><br/>Why not 5/5? The track pad primarily - it's pretty bad. Some people will always use an external mouse, and thus won't care, but if you're someone like me that uses the trackpad, it's not great. For $699 though, I can adapt to it.<br/><br/>Have any questions? Ask away and I'll answer them here.
Just a heads up to you mac users thinking about switching back to Windows in preparation for Windows 10 that are on a budget. YOU WILL NOT FIND A BETTER ULTRABOOK THAN THIS ONE RIGHT HERE!!!!!. Just as a bit of background, I have loved Apple since the iPhone 4s came out, but as I worked for best buy I quickly learned that Windows, Android, etc, have vastly improved since the days where apple would blow their products out of the water, and Asus is a brand I have just recently looked into starting with my kick ass router that I use at home which is a beast. That being said, no Windows laptop will be exactly like a macbook obviously and I am coming from a macbook pro. So first I will say this that the only thing that truly bugs me about the laptop is the trackpad. Since it isn't glass it doesn't have that same feel or subtle click a macbook would have. That however is my only complaint so here is my review.<br/><br/>Design- I never would have thought to have found such a powerful device in a thin design. I searched Craigslist before stumbling upon the UX305 online, looking for a macbook air. This thing is thinner, than a macbook air but ironically not lighter. That said this thing is LIGHT compared to my macbook pro and I can see myself taking this laptop anywhere. Build quality is a big pet peeve of mine when it comes to tech and Asus doesn't cut any corners here either. The laptop is made of all aluminum except for the high quality plastic on the screen bezels. Just like the other reviews the material is a fingerprint magnet but Asus includes a cleaning cloth with the machine. The 3 USB ports are very nice as I use a wireless mouse for increased productivity, a cooling try with USB extensions and flash drives all at the same time. I never have to worry about not having enough ports. The USBs are accompanied by a SD Card slot, a headphone jack, a power indicator light and the charging port.<br/><br/>Hardware and Specs- When I saw the price tag for the first time I never would have expected 8GB of DDR3 RAM and a 256 SSD! Laptops with these specs usually start at a GRAND! and the Macbook Air is no exception to that. Here is where you need to be careful. This laptop is running a Core M Processor. It is a 5th generation processor, but a core M none the less. For my uses, that is all I need. My schoolwork, web browsing, social media, media streaming, and light video editing are all I need. (Light being uploading footage, add transitions and trimming, audio editing, and then exporting). I haven't tested the video editing but everything else runs great. Web browsing tends to stutter a little because the processor hasn't fully caught up but just a second or two wait is all it needs. But with sacrifice comes reward. The reward is that you get a machine that is completely fanless QUIET and very power efficient, and that is where the up to 10 hours of battery life comes in. I usually don't test batteries on my laptops though because most of the time they are stationary on my coffee table waiting to be plugged in if necessary. I can't tell you enough what a joy it has been to be on a computer for 3 hours straight and not hear a single sound come from it except for my typing.  The RAM coupled with the SSD though and you get a machine that boots in 5 seconds, opens apps in less than a second, and has a sizeable amount of on board storage. However this laptop comes partitioned and I didn't like that but just deal with it otherwise you will have to fully reinstall a factory version of Windows 8.1 Pro that took hours.<br/><br/>Screen, Keyboard, Mouse- The Screen is a gorgeous non touch Full HD 1080p screen. I am so thankful my macbook wasn't a retina display macbook otherwise I wouldn't have been so excited to see this screen. Colors are bright and vibrant. Text is crisp and clear and its just a joy to look at. The best part is it is a matte display, so no fingerprints, no glossy reflection, and you can see this screen even in broad daylight. They keyboard I am happy to say is just about similar to my macbook pro. My girl owns a Sony Vaio I got her last year and I CAN'T STAND TYPING ON THAT THING. The key travel on the Asus is fairly nice and expected of such a thin macbook and the keys have a smooth yet satisfying click. I couldn't be happier with the keyboard. I have already expressed my opinion of the trackpad in the entrance paragraph. I will say though thanks to Asus' smart gesture driver, the main gestures I used on my mac which were zoom, back a page, and 2 finger scrolling all work great on this trackpad.<br/><br/>OS: I was a little worried coming back to Windows, but after seeing what Windows 10 will be like I couldn't be more excited. I had to come back to a Windows machine anyway because the online school that I attend is way more compatible with Windows than Mac unfortunately. Windows 8.1 Pro runs super smooth on this Asus Laptop and if you haven't had a touch screen laptop before this one then you won't notice any difference in the navigation.<br/><br/>Sound Quality: I don't have much to say here because I usually listen to laptop videos through headphones, but the outside speakers aren't the best, Asus had to cut corners somewhere and I am so glad it is with the speakers, They are on the bottom of the laptop though I am not sure why, and the sound quality is a little tinny, but the headphone sound is superb, so keep that in mind.<br/><br/>Misc: Just some other things of note about this laptop. There is no ethernet port however Asus is kind enough to provide a USB to ethernet adapter in the box your laptop comes in, there is also a cleaning cloth as I mentioned before. In addition, the Charging brick that comes with this thing is small thin and light just like the machine. This makes traveling with this machine so easy especially for those that love to pack light. Easily the smallest charger I have ever seen for a laptop. Asus also includes a 1 Year ADH warranty so if something physical breaks on your laptop (ie screen) Asus will repair or replace the laptop. See the site for details of course. One last thing, AC Wifi is not on this laptop but N running with a super smooth router like my asus one is a beast. Since the laptop isn't ideal for gaming, the wifi shouldn't be too much of an issue and N band wifi is still doing well speed wise.<br/><br/>Overall- This is the most bang for your buck Ultrabook ANYWHERE. I anticipate that if these make it to Best Buy we will sell a lot of these laptops. It is hard to argue the 699 price tag with the combination of the screen, the SSD, the RAM, the Processor, and the design of this laptop. As long as you aren't a power user or gamer, this laptop will be perfect for you and your wallet will thank you I am sure.
This computer is essentially a clone of MacBook Air, but runs Windows. The industrial design of this computer is impeccable. The only other Windows computer that equals or beats this computer in looks and build quality is Samsung ATIV Book 9, but a similarly equipped ATIV costs almost double.<br/><br/>On the negative side this computer does not have a backlit keyboard (can't be expected at this price point) and the speakers are kind of feeble.<br/><br/>Update 1: I took a star away because this computer has occasional display glitches. Once every 15 minutes or so you get a horizontal row of pixels that have not been rendered correctly. This vanishes quickly when you move the mouse. This issue bothered me enough to exchange the machine, but the replacement has the exact same issue. This seems like an Intel graphics card issue, and a driver update might fix the problem. Despite the issue I decided to keep the machine because there is nothing like this available in this price range.<br/><br/>I have attached a photo of the display glitch (see horizontal line on the Recycle Bin).<br/><br/>UPDATE 2: A video driver update is now available and it appears to have solved the display problems.<br/><br/>UPDATE 3: I have now been able to compare this computer to a Samsung NP940X3G which costs about twice as much. The Samsung has a significantly better screen, a backlit keyboard, and louder speakers. But I like this computer more because it is lighter, quieter (this computer doesn't have or need a fan), the screen is matte, and surprisingly performs better than the Samsung despite having a mobile processor. The Samsung has a touch screen which means it is glossy and has reflections. The display of this computer is slightly below par (colors, contrast etc.) so if you do graphics work this may not be the best computer, and that's the reason I took a star off.
This is by far the best price-performance-quality  13.3" windows laptop currently available, period.<br/><br/>Does it have room for improvement? Yes and here it is:<br/><br/>1. Power button location. Not sure how this design has made it through usability testing or even early design stage. It is too easy to accidentally turn off this laptop while typing. Since the power button is located RIGHT next to backspace button. I'm glad that laptop is fast and it resumes almost instantly from sleep but....This needs to be revised ASUS!<br/><br/>2. Hinge lifts the laptop off of it's feet. Strange as it causes the laptop to not firmly sit on its rubber feet and can potentially cause it to slide on a slick surface.<br/><br/>3. No back-lit keyboard. Seriously this is an extremely useful feature. Many of us would gladly pay $50 more for this superb laptop if it featured a back-lit keyboard. I'm sure others would too. Do it ASUS!<br/><br/>4. Not so much of an issue as an annoyance. Dark metallic surface of the UX305 shows fingerprints easily with minimal handling.<br/><br/>Why 5 starts with the 4 above mentioned flaws? Simple answer; price to performance. At $699.00 with this build quality and specs, UX305 value for lack of a better word is UNREAL. Closest resemblance can be attributed to MacBook Air at DOUBLE the cost.<br/><br/>The good:<br/><br/>1. Beautiful all aluminum design. It's slick and it's slim yet sturdy.<br/>2. Its fast. This is not a hard-core gaming laptop mind you but for everything else its perfect.<br/>3. Its silent. Yes no fans...no noise.<br/>4. It has a superb non-reflective screen which mostly eliminates glare and looks beautiful doing it.<br/>5. It has 256 GB or SSD! This supplemented with some cloud storage is mostly all you need!<br/>6. 8GB of RAM. Yes it comes with 8 not 4GB of RAM at this price.<br/>7. it has 3! USB 3 ports! Where others more expensive laptops still give you mix of usb 3 and usb 2 to save money.<br/>8. Great battery life. Around 8 hours of continuous use.<br/>9. 13.3" screen. Which is ideal portable laptop size.<br/>10. It's 699! Nuff said!<br/><br/>Don't just buy it. RUN before others realize what a great laptop it is and cause the back-order shortage.
I was very excited about this computer, looks like a great competitor to the macbook 12 and nearly half the cost.  upon receiving it build quality was very nice, and for the most part the computer was very quick and responsive(thanks to the SSD no doubt) however I had problems.  The main problems were with the screen, tracpad and wifi.<br/><br/>the Screen,<br/>The display had very lousy color accuracy and the whites were completely blown out.  I'm not an expert nor do I have the equipment to adjust the display properly so this was quite the dissapointment.  in addition to that the matt display had a haze over it that makes anything on the display just look worse than it should.<br/><br/>the Wifi adapter, The wifi would continuously cut out on both 2.4 and 5ghz networks tested in different locations with a variety of different routers.  all windows updates were installed, the latest asus drivers were installed and I eventually went and got some third party drivers and nothing worked.<br/><br/>The Trackpad:<br/>The trackpad is very large and seemingly nice however when using it it is no where near sensitive enough and someone like myself and also my wife who have somewhat moist skin find the trackpad to be very sticky and hard to drag a finger on comfortably.  the acceleration profiles on the trackpad are horrible and trying to do anything both quickly and accurately is impossible.  also the trackpad clicker is both hard to press and extreemely loud, not a pleasant experience at all.<br/><br/>minor complaints,<br/>The speakers,<br/>the speakers don't sound great(expected) however they are VERY quiet, situate yourself in a very quiet room if you expect to use them.<br/>sd card reader,<br/>the sd card sticks way out and is not a great connection.<br/><br/>The Battery:<br/>The battery never performed as advertised, in the first two weeks of use it never exceeded 6 hrs, and this is with using IE instead of chrome and being careful not to do anything very power intensive.  using Chrome will take another hour off your battery life.<br/><br/>things I like:<br/>I love the price, for what you get it is not beatable anywhere else.<br/><br/>The keyboard:<br/>The keyboard is great, better than that of my macbook I dare say.  lacks backlight however it is very nice to type on.<br/><br/>The processor:<br/>The processor may be limited to 5W however it is quite a good performer, exporting 35 raw photos from lightroom takes approximately one minute.  I did not try video editing however I was never in a situation that the processor slowed me down much, which honestly is what suprized me most.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this computer and by the specs I feel like I should however with all the problems that I had the computer was returned, I may look at their next generation as I really want a computer in this form factor.
Pro:<br/>- Good size and light weight.  Lighter and thinner than 2014 MacBook Air 13".<br/>- Good battery life.  Use it on and off for web, email and some PDF editing and it last for over 10 hrs.<br/>- Very fast boot up.  After install all the apps (MS office, Norton 360, pdf editor), it boot up in about 10 second.<br/>- Completely silent.  No Fan, no more hard drive accessing sound (It comes with 256GB SSD) and it only feels warm.<br/>- Intel Core M (5Y10) speed is good for web surfing, light photo editing, 1080p movie and business applications (Outlook, Excel, Word, PDF OCR and editing).  Not fast enough to do video converting and editing or high end gaming.<br/>- Price.  It comes with 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD (SanDisk).  A comparable Lenovo Yoga Pro 3 (has better screen and touch screen) with same RAM, SSD size, similar weight and physical size, it cost $1199 the last time I check.  That's is $500 more!!<br/>- Look and feel durable.  The case is aluminum and look very good., the keyboard feels good almost like typing on full size keyboard.<br/>- Built in TPM ver 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module).  I am planning to upgrade to Win 8.1 Pro version to encrypt the entire drive with Bitlocker.  (Bitlocker doesn't always requires TPM but it is more secure with it).<br/>- It comes with a external USB 3.0 to Ethernet (Only 100mb not gigabit) adapter incase you need to connect to a physical network.  Most of the laptop this size and weight usually doesn't has Ethernet port.  It is nice that ASUS includes this adapter.<br/>- 3 USB3.0 ports.  Most Ultrabook has only 1 to 2 USB 3.0 ports.<br/><br/>Con:<br/>- Speaker sound.  Very low even you turn it to the max.  Run the ICEpower-"AudioWizard" and change to "Music Mode" or "Gaming Mode" will help.  You can run "Smart Audio" to further adjust sound with Equalizer.<br/>- No backlight keyboard.  It is handy at night but not a deal breaker.<br/>- Memory RAM are fixed (soldered onto motherboard) and can't be changed or upgraded.  Let's hope the RAM doesn't die early or this laptop will be useless unless you change the motherboard.  It will not make any economic sense to fix it if RAM gone bad.<br/>- Although I have no problem wirelessly connecting to my Home ASUS (RT-AC68U) AC router, Office's N router, Starbucks and my local public library's Wi-Fi network, I wish ASUS put in the AC Wi-Fi instead.  The ASUS ZenBook equips with Intel Dual Band Wireless N 7265 network module.  I don't think the BIOS is whilelisted and I am planning to change to a AC module after warranty is up.<br/>- The SD Card reader.  When you put your SD Card into the slot, more than 1/2 of the SD card sticks out. It may be easy to lose or damage the SD card during travel if you keep the SD card in the reader slot.  I like my other laptops (bigger laptop) that will keep the SD card almost completely inside the slot with a spring type locking mechanism.<br/>- The Power button.  It sit right above the BackSpace botton.  It is just too easy to hit the power button when you mean to press the Backspace and the system will sleep or power down.  I reassign the button to "Do nothing" via "Power Option...Change Plan Settings...Change Advance Power Settings...Find "Power Button and Lid" and expand "Power button action" option.  The power button will still Power down the system if you hold and press it for more than 4 seconds.<br/><br/>There are only a few bloatwares installed and they are easily uninstalled.<br/>Couple of ASUS applications that you may want to keep and check out are<br/>ASUS "Audio Wizard" and "Smart Auto" to make the built-in speaker sound louder and sound better.  However, I don't know if this will impact the battery life.<br/>ASUS "Smart Gesture".  You can set to turn off the touchpad when a mouse is plug in.  Install "Remote Link" from Google Play to remotely control you Zenbook mouse pointer, keyboard, and other functions (Connected via local network or Bluetooth).  I couldn't find "Remote Link" in Apple App Store.<br/>If you need to boot to the BIOS screen, press F2 Key while booting will get you there.<br/><br/>I use this laptop mostly when I am travel and it serve my purpose very good.  It replaced my aging Lenovo X120e netbook which is much slower, smaller screen size and heavier.  I like this laptop and I only pay $699.  I was trying to decide between Dell XPS 13 & Lenovo Yoga Pro 3.  When ASUS release this laptop, I wasted no time and ordered it.  This is much better value if you don't need the touch screen.
Alright, this will be a lengthy review, but the thing that helped me the most in buying a laptop were lengthy reviews.<br/><br/>I have used this for all about 3 hours total and I am absolutely in love with this thing. I'll break it up into sections and I'll compare it to the Dell XPS 13 128GB 4GB of RAM - if that's what you're thinking about getting, then don't. Get this. I mean it.<br/><br/>Design:<br/>Firstly, this thing is light and thin. Obviously that's true, but holy hell, it's LIGHT and THIN. It's nearly all aluminum. The lid lifts up with out pulling the bottom half up, which is a rarity in laptops running Windows (not Macs though, weird). It doesn't tilt back all that far, maybe 120 to 140 degrees open, but it's not a big problem, as the viewing angles should be far better than most laptops. I should mention that this thing is a finger print magnet. Be wary of that. Not a deal breaker by any stretch.<br/><br/>Screen:<br/>I did not want a matte display at first. That's why I was looking at the XPS 13. However, as it turns out, the XPS 13 128GB model has a matte display. So, because of that, I went with this laptop. If you like glass over a display, stop liking glass over the display. It doesn't do much for color, it looks nice though, but glare is a big problem all the time... always. The matte display can be seen even out doors, which is nice when it's a great day outside. The color on this screen is very excellent as well. It's bright (brighter than the XPS) and clear. You'll be hard pressed to find anything better for the cost. The full HD is plenty enough for 90% of people.<br/><br/>Battery: I've been using this thing for about 3 hours, I'm using it now to write this review, and it has dropped down to 88% - It says about 10 hours remaining and that estimate hasn't really changed throughout writing this review (I actually dimmed the display and it went up to 10:10... neat). The XPS claims 15 hours, but you won't actually ever get that. This laptop claims 12 hours, and you'll probably get 10 to 12 doing very light activities. It's an exceptional player when it comes to battery life.<br/><br/>Performance:<br/>Well, it's fast. It boots in a timed 7 seconds, at the longest. I've got the i5, 256GB SSD, 8GB RAM version and you will not find anything faster for the price. Especially when it's this size (Exceptionally thin and light). It's got enough performance to the point where it doesn't really matter what I'm doing, it will handle it - minus gaming. It handles casual gaming just fine (think Minecraft) but you're not going to be playing GTA 5 on ultra.<br/><br/>Touchpad/Keyboard:<br/>The touch pad, think MacBook. It has regular tapping and movement, pinch to zoom (two fingers), two finger scrolling... As well as some three finger gestures (show windows, switch windows, switch tabs, etc).  It's not quite as good as the MacBook touchpad, but it's very nice. They keyboard is pretty unremarkable. It's probably the worst thing about this laptop, but it's extremely average. It's not a bad keyboard, the keys type well but they don't have a lot of movement (they don't move down much) and it's extremely flat. You're not going to get much better, if at all, when you're looking at laptops this thin and light.<br/><br/>Speakers:<br/>Nothing mind blowing. They're speakers. They get relatively loud for the size and without distorting sound, you can hit max volume. There's not a lot of bass, don't expect a ton. But seriously, they're not bad.<br/><br/>Recommendation:<br/>YES. Buy this. Don't get the Core M. Get the i5. You'll like it more. It has a larger battery and a faster processor with better battery than the Core M version and it's only 50 dollars more. This is the best ultrabook under $1000. I could see this being sold for $1000 and people would still buy it.
This laptop is a dream.  It is super light-weight, and thin, and a good value for this price point.  Shut-down and boot-up take 1-3 seconds and graphics on the screen are bright and crisp.  Keyboard is good and responsive.  Laptop is silent, no sound at all .  Multiple internet tabs are not a problem.  I use it to surf the web and for home admin work, and it works great for that.  I researched a lot of laptops and was looking for very low weight, portability, decent computing power and low price.  This laptop meets my requirements and I am happy that I purchased it.<br/><br/>Drawbacks are that it shows fingerprints and sometimes heats up after long usage (3-4 hrs).  It comes pre-installed with Windows 8, which as mentioned boots, very quickly.  I have found that one update seemed to freeze the machine on boot-up.  After downloading the update, boot-up would show "Configuring Windows features, 100% complete" and continue showing this for 30+ minutes.  I used the link below to solve the problem, which seemed to appear on a lot of Asus Windows 8 laptops.  The update that seemed to cause the problem  was "Security Update for Windows 8 for x64-based".  I solved the problem by doing multiple hard reboots of the laptop.<br/><br/>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-system/asus-transformer-t100t-tabletlaptop-stuck-on/2a099e22-4edf-42fd-bfab-375161b6bd73<br/><br/>Someone earlier commented that the delete and power buttons are close to each other and sometimes lead to the user turning off the laptop by accident.  I have noticed this key placement too, but so far it has not been a problem.<br/><br/>All-in-all, I recommend this laptop.  If the laptop didn't show fingerprints, heat up, and didn't have that windows update glitch I would rate a 5.
UPDATE:<br/><br/>Only 2 weeks in, with a cumulative total of less than 5 hours of use (all light web surfing), on FOUR occasions I've had the screen go completely black for a few seconds, only to come back on with an error saying "Display driver stopped responding and has recovered".<br/><br/>It's infuriating and unacceptable. I knew when I bought this that it wasn't the Lamborghini of laptops, but even Honda Civics shouldn't have engine problems 2 weeks after you buy it brand new.<br/><br/>I've tried downloading the latest driver updates. Needless to say I'll be returning if I can't find a solution in the next day or so.<br/><br/>Initial Review (after 1 week of use)<br/><br/>Pros: Boots up quickly, all around fast performance, keys have good feel and travel distance, super light and portable, good battery life.<br/><br/>Could be better: Brighter backlight on the screen, no backlit keyboard<br/><br/>Terrible: Trackpad. I am a Macbook convert, I knew the trackpad was not going to be as nice as that, but this is extremely poor.I use a Dell laptop at work and it is significantly better than this one. The Asus does a mediocre job of tracking movement, but the biggest issue is the material of the actual pad. Imagine a piece of plastic covered in the sticky residue leftover from trying to remove a price sticker from something, and there you go.<br/><br/>I keep thinking I'll "get use to it", but it is actually becoming increasingly annoying. You truly don't notice how much you use the trackpad until you have to use a terrible track pad. If you plan on using a traditional mouse you're in the clear, but having to bring a mouse with you everywhere takes away from one of this laptop's biggest strengths - it's portability.<br/><br/>If anyone from Asus ever sees this, please address this issue. I (and most people) would be glad to pay an extra $50 on the MSRP in exchange for not having our fingers tortured every time we want to check our email.
IMPORTANT DISCLOSURE: This review is for the ZenBook UX305FA Crystal White Limited Edition. It is essentially the same as the regular Zenbook 305FA being sold here, except that it has a bit of a better processor, a better resolution (3200x1800 vs. 1080p), and more storage (512GB vs. 256GB).<br/><br/>It is important to note that this review directly applies to the regular Zenbook 305FA because even though I had bought the higher end model, what I have to say most urgently is that it is a slow system, which in turn doubly applies to the regular model of the ultrabook.<br/><br/>I also highly suggest doing a large amount of research outside of this review, preferably watching videos facilitated by bona fide tech reviewers alongside of reading Amazon reviews, to inform oneself about what they are buying in a more wholesome manner.<br/><br/>I had the ultrabook for about two months, so I’ve been able to experience it extensively, and will provide proof of purchase in the pictures. I also would like to apologize if this review is lengthy; I am making sure to cover everything I can think of, so here it goes.<br/><br/>------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Background and brief summary:<br/><br/>My experience with this laptop (and ASUS overall) has been a VERY dissatisfying one. I sold a previous laptop (Apple) in favor of one that operates Windows natively after moving to a new engineering research position at a University that demanded certain software requirements.<br/><br/>Upon searching, I stumbled upon the Zenbook UX305FA, and decided to buy the exclusive Crystal White limited edition given that they were still in stock and 'better'.<br/><br/>After horrid customer service (which caused my laptop to be 4 days late and in turn made my $30+ payment for one day shipping moot), I finally received my laptop.<br/><br/>------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>The pros:<br/><br/>The ultrabook itself aesthetically looks beautiful. It feels pleasant to the touch, and I personally love the keyboard. The screen is gorgeous with its high resolution, and the entire thing is very light!<br/><br/>These are the reasons why my review is two stars instead of one. Though, given that I am reviewing the exclusive, higher end model of this laptop, one or two of these pros don't fully apply.<br/><br/>------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>The cons:<br/><br/>In my experience, the (Crystal White) Zenbook 305FA lags horribly if you have more than a handful of web pages open and are also attempting to do any sort of small processor/RAM intensive task alongside it.<br/><br/>The sub-par performance of this laptop was so bad that I was forced to use older, outdated spare desktop computers running Windows 7 at my research lab over 90% of the time because using this laptop to run any MatLab scripts, create any CAD drawings, or have more than two handfuls of web pages open, was as effective as using a banana to build a campfire (seems hyperbolic, but that’s how it really felt sometimes!).<br/><br/>It also heats up extremely quickly due to its design which dictates a lack of a fan, and in turn spreads the heat/energy into the metal bottom. This makes it an uncomfortable experience when attempting to put it on your lap.<br/><br/>------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>THE CRUCIAL WARNING SIGN THAT I MISSED:<br/><br/>ASUS seems to refuse to post their processor speeds (in hard numbers) on their listings when it comes to the Zenbook 305FA as far as I can tell. They must be ashamed of it because they only list the name of the processor next to the amount of RAM the computer has.<br/><br/>8GB of RAM is fine, but it's a bit ridiculous and purposefully misleading when you omit the power of the part of the computer (the processor) that is considered the brain of the system.<br/><br/>----------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>The numbers that ASUS seems to refuse to divulge:<br/><br/>For the higher end Crystal White model that I bought, the base processor speed is 1.20Ghz. To put that in perspective, these sort of speeds were hit in the very early 2000s (think 2002) on the highest end models. To be fair: the processors in the Zenbook 305FA series have a cache which speeds things up a bit.<br/><br/>They are also 'special' because they are designed for energy efficiency, which 'allows' for no fan and in turn a more compact laptop. The problem is that it sacrifices performance significantly, since the new mobile processors are in their early generations (trust me, I'm an engineer).<br/><br/>The base processor speed of the Zenbook 305FA being sold here is .8Ghz, or 800Mhz. Again, the funny thing is, you will not find that number anywhere here on the product description/details as far as I can tell. That alone should more than adequately warn potential buyers about what type of laptop is being sold and the relatively obvious manipulation being attempted.<br/><br/>----------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>To clarify/reemphasize:<br/><br/>The only RARE mention of any actual processor speed number seems to be whenever they're talking about its potential higher limit, and they try to make it sound as fast as possible by saying "it 'turbos' up to 2.9Ghz" (for the Crystal White Edition; for the regular edition here, it 'turbos' to 2.0Ghz).<br/><br/>Do not be fooled. Turbo boosting and/or overclocking is not sustainable and these processors/laptops are not designed to constantly and consistently stay at that level of performance; IF they were, every laptop would have these 'miracle' processors.<br/><br/>This is, to emphasis again, ASUS using manipulation and incorporating sales/advertising tactics to sell the product. I don't think I have ever seen any other laptop advertisement that omits processor power, it's really unbelievable.<br/><br/>The result of all of this is that the laptop severely lagged when using Firefox or Chrome with more than 8 tabs open; never have I once had that problem or any other mentioned with any laptop that has had at least 1.8Ghz of power. That alone moots the '2.9Ghz turbo boost', but ASUS seems confident enough to only mention that Machiavellian number in their advertisements.<br/><br/>In the end, I had to get rid of the laptop last week to a local acquaintance given its lack of functionality in my day to day affairs.<br/><br/>------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>To conclude, I would again urge buyers to research deeply into whatever laptop they buy (not just this one) so as not to be tricked. This laptop might be adequate enough for some people, but please make sure to fully research it and not get baited into buying it. There are plenty of great tech reviewers out there that go into every metaphorical and literal nook and cranny of a laptop.<br/><br/>I would also like to say to make sure to look at more reviews, inside and outside of Amazon, than just mine; however objective I feel my review is (have been working alongside and on computers for at least five years), I just have one perspective. It’s good to diversify opinions and sources of information.<br/><br/>Thanks for taking the time to read any or all of this. I really hope that this review offered some sort of help to at least some degree in some way.
I finally became sick of my old, heavy laptop. So I've researched many laptops online and in person at various stores. My top two choices were the Dell XPS 13 (2015 edition) and this Asus Zenbook UX305. My primary concern about the Zenbook was the processor. I am a developer and wasn't sure if it could handle my workload. I've been using this laptop for a few days now, and it's been performing great! Visual Studio 2013 is lightning fast. I've also used VMWare Workstation and the XP VM runs terrifically. I've loaded up many programs simultaneously and did not notice any slowdown. It's really great to have 8GB of RAM (which is a $100 upgrade for the XPS 13) and a 256GB SSD is more than enough. The XPS 13's screen looked great, but it wasn't worth a few hundred dollars more to me (since I would need to get the Intel i5 and 8GB upgrade). A few things of note:<br/>- I installed the Stardock Start8 start menu replacement program. Windows 8 is actually pretty good if you never go into the tile mode (which is pretty useless as a developer).<br/>- I deactivated Windows Defender. It was maxing out one of the CPUs (1 of 4), and I've never found much use for real-time virus protection if you know what you're doing :-)<br/>- So with the high-resolution and small screen, Windows 8.1 is pretty good at scaling various programs to make them bigger. Out of the box, it didn't work very well for VMWare ESXI Client, since I couldn't see the full remote desktop screen. So I found there's a setting when launching the program to not scale the program. So I can view the remote desktop at full resolution (but it's a bit small).<br/>- It would be nice to have one more inch of screen real estate (13.3" to 14"). But the 14" laptops are a bit heavier and aren't as great of value.<br/>- I prefer a real mouse over a touchpad. So I am using an Amazon Basics Wireless mouse, with the tiny USB receiver. I might consider a Bluetooth mouse since this laptop has a BT receiver.
This is a fantastic laptop. I've been using a MacBook Air for a while and when it fell to the ground and the screen was shattered, I felt paying $450 for a new screen was a ripoff. After lots of researching, I settled for this UX305, buying the 8GB RAM, Core i5 and 256GB SSD version. My comparison will be directly to my experience with the MacBook Air.<br/><br/>1) Performance: if you buy the Core i5 version (cost me $750 from Amazon, just $50 more than the anemic Core M version) you get a 5200U processor, which is very similar to what you get on a 2015 MacBook Air. This is the Broadwell architecture from 2015, which in itself is little more than a 14nm reduction of the 2014 Haswell architecture, which was 20nm. When the fabrication process of the CPU is reduced (20 to 14 nanometers), you automatically get power benefits, giving you the option of achieving better battery life with the same performance as last year, or more performance at the same battery life as the previous year. Over the past few weeks that I've owned the UX305, I regularly have Word, Excel, Acrobat Pro and Edge/Chrome open with ~10 tabs active. This doesn't fully load the 8GB RAM and the performance remains fluid. I even tried playing 4K videos on YouTube and they played flawlessly, no stutter. So, performance, for office work - and light gaming, think Trine 2 on high settings and 720p resolution - is flawless.<br/><br/>2) Weight: the MacBook Air is 2.97 pounds, whereas the UX305 is 2.6 pounds. If you find the Air portable, the UX305 is even more so. I didn't think I'd notice those .3 pounds, but it actually makes a big, big difference. I "forget" my UX305 is in my work bag, whereas I was very conscious that the Air was in it.<br/><br/>3) Design: pretty much a MacBook Air ripoff. The frame of the laptop is actually a bit thinner and narrower than the Air, so you get a similar experience on an overall smaller (by a hair) machine. The aluminum build feels great and is sturdy - no flex that I notice, but I'm not bending it on purpose as those tests make no sense.<br/><br/>The keyboard doesn't feel as excellent in quality as the Air, but then again, the UX305 is literally half the price of the equivalent Air. Still, I'm typing on it right now, and it's been perfectly fine for the past few weeks. There is enough key travel to be comfortable and keys are well spaced. The only drawback is the lack of keyboard backlight, but if you don't type in dark places, this is a non-issue. (I've heard people complain about the power button position on top of the backspace key: guess what, it's literally the same as the Air, yet nobody ever complained about that in the Apple machine. That's bias for you. It was never a problem for Apple, yet somehow it "is a problem" in the Asus for some reviewers. News flash: it wasn't a problem in the Air, and it's not a problem in the Asus. It's literally the same.)<br/><br/>The screen is insane. A 13.3" 1080p IPS matte panel - compare that to the Air's pathetic 900p TFT display. The matte panel is welcome as I have yet to see a single reflection on the screen: it is pristinely clear. Windows 10 defaults to a 150% scaling which I think makes everything look like fisher price toys. I toned it back down to %125 and things look perfect, super sharp too. Color calibration is a bit cool - makes the screen seem a bit brighter - and after calibrating with my Spyder5Express - which I wholeheartedly recommend - it looks even better. A bit dimmer than factory default, for sure, but still bright enough for using outside under sunlight.<br/><br/>The audio quality is better than I expected. I had read plenty reviews that said the audio sucks and it's quite tinny. Maybe that's a problem with the Core M version, but on this i5 honestly it sounds fine. If anything, it's not tinny at all, it has a decent "body" or "volume", it reminds me of the Surface Pro 3, so I wouldn't call it bad at all. Of course, don't expect amazing bass, you have to be realistic here, but it's perfectly fine sound quality. I would say though, the MacBook Air definitely had better sound. Not insanely better, but it felt as better quality reproduction (not sure how to explain it). Then again, remember: the UX305 costs half what the Air does.<br/><br/>4) Battery - I've used it for 2 working days straight (not constantly on) on a battery charge. On a more regular workday, it lasts through the day, usually around 9 hours. That's pretty much all I need. The Air gives you easily 3-4h more battery life on equivalent workloads, but the UX305 gets me through the day comfortably and that's all I need.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, this UX305 is in essence a faster, lighter, more powerful version of the i5 MacBook Air, but it is Windows based, made by Asus and it'll cost you half the price. If you want such a machine for office work and light gaming/browsing/video viewing, go for it. It's excellent.
I rarely leave reviews on Amazon but I like this laptop (i5 version Asus Zenbook UX305LA) so much that I want to share some information and how I tuned its screen. I bought this laptop for my mom because of the excellent review article on www.notebookcheck.net and the very decent deal on Amazon. I happen to have a Dell XPS 13-9343, which has identical CPU, RAM, and SSD but QHD+ display. So I'm making a comparison between the 2 products.<br/><br/>I'll start with the Cons:<br/><br/>1. The FHD screen has both pros and cons. It's super bright, contrast rich and has great color depth. And 1080P is more than enough for a 13 inch laptop. However, if here is only one major complain about this laptop, it would be the poor color calibration of the screen. It feels greenish even without comparing with my Dell XPS 13, which by the way is calibrated very well out of the box. Here's how I tuned my screen: First, remove the 'Asus splendid' software, because it prevents any manual adjustment to the screen. Then click start button and search for 'Calibrate display color'. Using this software, click 'next' all the way until you see 'adjust color balance'. Move the green slide to -2 and click 'next' until finish. The screen will look much better after this adjustment.<br/><br/>2. The touchpad is not as flawless as a MacBook or as excellent as my Dell XPS 13. The two finger scrolling is sometimes a little bit jumpy when I'm browsing the web. The material feels like plastic and it's sticky if there are sweat on my fingertips. As a comparison, the matte surface on my Dell XPS's touchpad provides a much more pleasant feeling and a more smooth scrolling experience. However, I don't mean the Zenbook has a bad trackpad. Actually it's quite precise and easy to use in most of the cases. I've experienced a much worse trackpad on my old Lenovo.<br/><br/>3. The lack of backlight keyboard. I appreciate my Dell XPS's beautiful backlight keyboard. But I'm not the kind of person who consider a backlight keyboard to be a default setting. So I'm quite OK with that.<br/><br/>The Pros:<br/><br/>Everything else! Please read other reviews on Amazon for details. I'll only mention one point that is omitted by the others: this laptop has only a few bloatwares, and none of them is very annoying or taking up a lot of disk space. I really appreciate it due to the unpleasant experience of my other PC laptops before.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>In my opinion the Dell XPS 13 is the perfect PC laptop and Asus Zenbook UX305LA is very close to it. My major complains include the poor screen color calibration and the suboptimal trackpad. But for about half the price of a Dell XPS 13 or a MacBook, I think this laptop is an excellent deal.
pros: Lots of Ram, Large SSD, Battery Life, Portable, Screen Resolution, number and type of ports.<br/><br/>cons: integrated graphics card, windows 8 (not ASUS fault can be fixed for free when windows 10 is released)<br/><br/>This laptop is truly amazing. My old laptop which has been my main computer for the last 4 years has a 2.6 GHz processor and 4 gigs of RAM. I have owned and use the ux305 for about a week and run test to compare it to my old laptop. The first thing you have to realize is that this laptop will not be able to out perform a desktop or even many other laptops, but it can keep up with them without too much touble. It does not have the processor speed necessary to be a blazing fast, set the world on fire, kind of computer. That being said it is surprisingly fast. I am a graduate mechanical engineering student in Mechanical Engineering and I routinely run very demanding programs, COMSOL multiphysics (which is a computational modeling software), SolidWorks, Matlab, computer programing, etc. and this computer can handle it without a problem. Programs like SolidWorks and COMSOL require lots of processor power because they do a lot of work under the hood, but the processor can ramp up from .8 GHz to 2 GHz when necessary.Comparing it to my old laptop it runs these programs equally as fast or faster. Start up times and run times were equal to or faster than with the old laptop possible\y do to the extra RAM and SSD. Where you will really notice a problem is if you try and run programs which are very graphic intensive. The ux305 has an integrated graphics card so its ability to render complicated graphics is limited. You will not be able to edit tons of HD video or replace your gaming computer with this laptop, but I was able to play Team Fortress 2 and Boarderlands 2 without a problem; those are older games but that gives you an idea of the type of games the processor can handle. I was really worried about ux305's ability to run the programs I needed it to given its slower processor, but in my experience the only difference I have noticed as been marginal at worst if at all. I would definitely recommend this laptop to anyone.
First of all, I purchased this laptop from the Microsoft store instead of Amazon which comes with no bloat ware and is optimized for Windows (whatever that means).  I was really excited to unbox the laptop and begin using it immediately as this is the lightest and thinnest laptop that I've ever owned and it supposedly gets 10+ hours of battery life.  And as many other reviews have stated, you get a lot of bang for the buck.  At the moment no other laptop gives you a 256gb ssd and 8gb of ram for $699.  The only other feature I wished it has is a backlit keyboard.  I primarily use the laptop for surfing the web, light word processing, and some spreadsheet work and when working on the bed with the lights off, a backlit keyboard is a must.<br/><br/>I didn't run any benchmarks, but all of the work I've done on it so far has gone smoothly.  One thing I did check is the battery life.  I got about 7.5 hours of use off my first charge which I'm happy with since I travel quite a bit and can usually recharge before the battery runs out.  I couldn't say the same for my previous laptop which needed charging after 3 hours so this is a major improvement.<br/><br/>Almost everything about the laptop was perfect....the touchpad however drove me crazy.  For some reason I felt the right click made more noise than it should and just pressing it didn't feel like it clicked properly.  It felt like the touchpad was loose and made a clattering noise every time I pressed it.  I went back to the store and checked out the demo unit and the touchpad on the demo unit was firm and tight fitting.  Then I googled the problem and it seems like others were having the issue too.  I exchanged the laptop for another one and it had the same problem.  I then exchanged it one more time and the 3rd laptop still had the problem!  I was really bummed and was about to return it for a full refund.  I really wanted to keep the computer, but every time I clicked the touchpad it just bothered me.<br/><br/>I searched for a fix and came across a website that showed how to disassemble the laptop.  I was fairly hopeful that if I opened it up, I could easily fix the issue with some electrical tape which would tighten the gap that was making the touchpad behave the way it did.  Well I gently opened the back cover and examined the touchpad area.  I lightly tapped around and noticed that if I pressed against the bottom plate of the touchpad, the touchpad felt much better.  So I added a couple strips of electrical tape and sealed everything back up.  It was enough tape for the bottom cover to firmly press against the touchpad and now it is 99% better.<br/><br/>I would have easily given this laptop 5 stars, but because of this touchpad issue I'm only giving it 4.  If I could not have remedied that problem, I probably would have just returned the laptop and give it a 2 star rating.  I wouldn't recommend this fix for everyone since I probably voided my warranty.  But now that the touchpad doesn't clatter, I feel like its worth it.
The laptop was very easy to setup and get going.  It includes three USB 3 ports and an SD Card Reader on the left side.  It comes with a 256 Gig Solid State Sandisk drive that arrived partitioned into a 95 gig C: partition and a 130 Gig D data partition. Since it is very thin it was not possible to place an Ethernet port on it so Asus includes a USB to Gigabit Ethernet adapter in the box -which I appreciated - since some companies out there will charge you for it.  8GB of RAM is included, which is more than enough for most tasks. The keyboard has a nice feel to it and is not lighted. The battery is contained within the chassis and requires servicing to change. The machine comes with Windows 8.1 Home installed on it. I tested the machine on a variety of applications and it worked very well.  I really did not see any sluggishness on web browsing, email, or Microsoft office products like Word, Excel, or Powerpoint.  Of course if you are a gamer or power user this machine probably will not have enough speed.  For Internet and Office applications  it is great.<br/><br/>During testing I never experienced any problems with overheating.  The only time the unit got really warm was when I installed the 56 Windows updates required to bring Windows 8.1 up to date.  Every machine I have(Mac or PC) gets warm doing something like that.  And the fans always turn on making a lot of noise.  This wonderful unit remained silent.  An incredible feature as I see it.<br/><br/>The quality of the 13 inch Matte screen is excellent with very good colors and nice wide viewing angle.  One thing that needs to be pointed out is that this is not touch screen capable.  I do not see that as any problem at all, especially with Windows 10 on the horizon.  I did not find any bad pixels or other anomalies.  Construction of the unit seems solid even with its very thin profile.<br/><br/>I am getting about 6.5 hours of battery life with mixed use of Office and Internet. The laptop comes with a 12 month warranty.<br/><br/>The only real cons I can find with this laptop are that its dark color allow fingerprints to show up quite readily and that its keyboard is unlighted.<br/><br/>All in all this is a excellent laptop and Highly recommended.
<br/><br/>
This review is for the ASUS Zenbook UX305LA 13.3-Inch 8GB 256GB for $749.99<br/><br/>This laptop is without a doubt the highest value I have seen for an ultrabook in this price range. This machine is quick, quiet, and efficient. To top it off, it can last an extremely long time on a single charge.<br/><br/>You'll notice right away that the machine runs everyday programs without trouble. Programs such as Explorer/Chrome, Word, Excel, Adobe, etc. With the combination of the i5, and the high amount of ram, this machine can even run some games. Nothing revolutionary, but simpler light games to keep you occupied. The amazing part is not the fact that it can play games. It's amazing because at a low cost, you have a decent work laptop that is a little over 2lbs and has 8gb of ram with a higher than average SSD for storage. I won't quote any prices to part comparison here because you can just as easily verify it yourself with whatever you are using to read this review.<br/><br/>The second point of interest is how quiet this thing is. There are fans in this laptop, but you'll rarely hear it. You can watch a nice quiet scene in a movie and it won't make a peep. Some models out there are quiet and some don't have any fans, but in my experience, you are better off with a fan. Electronics get hot. That seems like a dumb statement to point out, but think about how they have fanless laptops. They have to underclock everything to make it cool enough to run or else there are serious risk of damage to the components. I feel like you get the best of both worlds here.<br/><br/>Finally, when I say that this machine is efficient, I mean the battery will actually last a fairly long time on normal settings and not quoted by throwing it in a freezer, on the lowest power settings, with the screen turned off. I mean you can use it to write a paper, browse the internet, chat with friends, or watch a movie with said friends. Of course watching a movie on the nice 1080p screen will drain the battery more quickly, but typically this 8-10 hour battery will last you anywhere from 5-7 hours when in daily use.<br/><br/>This laptop is not without some flaws or things I wish it had. There is no backlit keyboard, the quality of the product may vary wildly due to some QA issues with ASUS (more on this later), the power button is right above the backspace key, and the mic will pick up typing and sounds from your laptop quite loudly. I can't say the last one is a flaw, because most laptops do that due to the general placement of the hardware. Also, an important note to people that may want to upgrade individual parts: It is extremely hard/labor intensive/impossible to replace some parts on this laptop due to the soldering. You give up those options to have a sleek light laptop. Not a flaw, just a fair warning. This also means if something breaks... you are in for a world of hurt.<br/><br/>Which brings me back to ASUS and their QA troubles. For some reason, ASUS or the their subcontractors cannot get a consistent quality assurance program going. They have had trouble since the release of the first few zenbook models. Many people love their zenbooks. In fact, I love my zenbook, but many people also hate it because of reports of machine that are dead on arrival, dead shortly after arrival, or malfunctions mostly due to the corruption of the SSD.<br/><br/>Personally, that is why I gave this machine a 4 star rating. My first one had a bad SSD soldered on and my second one had a faulty fan. It would make a weird and loud clicking noise shortly after being turned on. To be clear, I could hear it over the movie/game sounds that were turned up quite a bit. However, the third time is the charm, I guess. No problems so far and amazon was amazing about the returns. I just wish the first one worked out of the box.<br/><br/>Just test your machine out before you really commit to it. Make sure there are no dead pixels by changing the background to black then white. Also make sure to get the latest drivers from various websites. You can download the Intel Update Utility to easily update the wireless and Bluetooth adaptor  (which has problems and is really slow as stock). Also make sure to use every aspect of the computer and run it for a few days to see if anything strange happens.<br/><br/>Hope this review helps!<br/><br/>EDIT 11/05/2015<br/><br/>.,;'*^-.,;'*^-.,;'*^-.,;'*^-FOR THOSE WITH WIFI PROBLEMS.

I haven't encountered a laptop I have as much enjoyed using since my old Zenbook Prime UX31A circa 2012. I was hesitant to buy it since I was dissatisfied with my Zenbook UX303LN, but I do not regret getting this. I checked it out at my local Microcenter before making the decision, and the first thing that comes to mind is, "wow is this thing thin." According to AnandTech reviews, it is about half a millimetre thinner than the new Macbook(the one with a single port), and on this one you get three full-size USB ports. I was additionally hesitant to buy it because of the Core M processor, but this thing holds itself really well in all day to day tasks. Additionally, all the hardware seems to work out of the box with Linux, apart from the screen brightness keys, but keymapping utilities and XAutomation can be used to solve this problem. The 256GB SSD is more than large enough to dual boot Windows 8 and Arch Linux for me, though Arch is my primary system. The only time I have noticed this laptop slowing down is during large file transfers from my home server, since the Core M CPUs tend to handle themselves better in quick, few operation, tasks, where they can turbo. On tasks which take some time, like file transfers, the CPU limits itself to its base frequency. While it gets hot when doing tasks such as installing an operating system, during day to day use it does not get nearly hot enough to make it uncomfortable to use on your lap. The display is superb from my experience, and I have always liked the matte displays. Keyboard is as comfortable as you can expect from a device so thin, touchpad works well and is supported by recent Linux kernels, so clearly Asus ditched FocalTech as a vendor. But again, I really must emphasize how thin and liight this machine is, I am astonished that they can make a machine so thin which is perfectly powerful and still has such a wide selection of ports! If you're on edge about buying this laptop because of the price, I would go for it. Apart from the lack of keyboard backlighting, which is not really a deal for me, this machine has all the quality I have come to expect out of $1,100 ultrabooks and higher, for only $700! Stellar!
I have to tell you, I'm loving my new ASUS Zenbook UX305. Before I get into the heart of the review, here's the short version: Macbook Air class with PC style, OS, and pricing.<br/><br/>Now the long version:<br/><br/>The UX305 is an ultrabook. What that means in practical terms is that it is designed with slim and lightweight construction as the primary concern. You'd think this would mean that performance would be compromised, but is it? Well, that depends on what you're doing.<br/>If you're looking for a gaming laptop, this probably isn't going to be your thing. It has no optical drive (meaning CD/DVD or Blu-ray Disc), and it doesn't have a discrete (separate) graphics chipset. The Core-M processor offers up Intel 5300 graphics, which are sufficient for high definition video, average Photoshop work, light video editing, and casual gaming. While it can certainly handle modern games on lower settings, it's not meant to do ultra-high graphical effects and deliver the way a dedicated graphics card would. If you want to play older games on higher settings, or do some casual modern gaming at lower graphical settings, it will handle those things just fine.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a design workstation or video editing laptop, again this might not be the best choice, though it's certainly capable. Again, you'll want something with discrete graphics and possibly a Core i5 or better. The trade-off when you do that is size (it will be bulkier), battery life (it will not last as long), and price (it will cost you quite a bit more).<br/><br/>What will the UX305 handle? Everything else. Watching 1080p videos, web surfing, word processing, email, spreadsheets, PowerPoint, disc burning (with an optional external optical drive), file management, downloading, uploading, running Windows programs and Windows 8 apps, basic video or audio editing, and other day-to-day tasks.<br/><br/>The primary benefit of the Core-M chip is the ability to run cool without needing a fan. It will normally run at 800 MHz, but will automatically throttle up to 2.0 GHz when needed. Without a fan, this is a completely solid-state device. There are no moving parts because there's no hard drive (SSD instead), and no optical drive (they're becoming obsolete anyway), and no need to use active cooling. This means it's completely silent (no fan noise) and has a longer battery life. When doing basic tasks (web surfing, email, etc.) you can expect upwards to 10 hours, depending on settings. When doing more CPU-intensive tasks, that gets dropped as low as 5 hours, but that's pretty good for a device as thin as this.<br/><br/>Solid-state also means it's lighter, thinner, and far more portable. That's appealing to some people. The Intel Core M-5Y10 CPU comes in somewhere between the Core i3 and Core i5, and handles graphics and sound just fine, making this as thing as the newest tablets, but with the convenience and power of a full-featured Windows laptop. It can handle x86 or x64 Windows programs and applications, unlike the earlier Bay Trail devices. It does seem to outperform other mobile Core i3 and Core i5 laptops when it comes to everyday tasks.<br/><br/>I found the keyboard to be remarkable considering how amazingly thin this laptop is. Key travel was excellent, and key spacing was "normal" since this is still a 13" laptop, even if it is super-thin. I'm a bit disappointed that it's not a backlit keyboard, but that's a premium feature you don't see on most mid-priced laptops, so I can deal with it.<br/><br/>As stated previously, this thing is ridiculously thin and light. The metal finish is gorgeous, too. Really, I'd have to say this is a sexy computer, and it feels really solid and well-built. No complaints whatsoever about the casing design. I like how the lid opens to form a little elevating "foot" or "ledge" that props up the bottom a bit.<br/><br/>The trackpad is decent enough. I'm really not the biggest fan of trackpads, but this one is rather large and does present the user with actual clickable "button" sections. You don't have to rely on the "touch to click" feature, though ASUS does an okay job limiting the accidental taps. The touchpad also supports gestures, though I generally don't mess with those with the exception of the "two fingers to scroll" gesture, which works fine. I should also note that the "IceCool" technology ASUS talks about in their literature seems to work here, keeping the Zenbook from getting warm, which means it's comfortable for your hands and your lap.<br/><br/>The full-HD screen is beautiful! First, I have to say I greatly appreciate that this is a matte screen! Glossy is so reflective, and it's nice to be able to view this beautiful 1920x1080 screen without seeing my reflection in it. I can see the work I'm doing instead of the lights behind me! Of course, being a matte IPS screen means no touch screen (the touch screens are all glossy, to the best of my knowledge) though rumor has it ASUS will be offering the higher-resolution, more expensive model with the glossy touch screen as an option. Personally, I tend to stay out of the "tiles" section of Windows 8.1 so touch screens on PCs have yet to be a requirement for me.<br/><br/>The laptop comes with a FAST 256 GB solid state drive (SSD). For those who don't know what that is, it's a replacement for the hard drive that has no moving parts. Traditional hard drives are made up of several spinning platters, but an SSD is more like the USB flash drives or SD cards you've probably used, but better constructed and blazing fast. How fast? Up to six times faster than a regular hard drive. That means the system boots up faster, everything loads faster, and you don't have to worry about damage to the drive from minor impact or movement. It also draws less power than a traditional hard drive. Trust me, you'll like the speed of the SSD. The good news is that this SSD is allegedly not soldered in, so later down the line you *might* be able to upgrade to a bigger one (when they become affordable. SSDs are *not* cheap!)<br/><br/>There's also 8 GB of RAM in this computer. That's outstanding, considering most Windows programs barely touch anything above 6 GB. The down-side is that the RAM appears to be soldered into the system so it's not replaceable or upgradable. The positive side is that it's highly unlikely you'll need more than 8 GB in the foreseeable future because of the way Windows handles RAM. Anyway, most laptops in this price range come with 4 or 6 GB of RAM, so this is a pretty good deal.<br/><br/>For ports and connectivity, the Zenbook has micro-HDMI (which they say supports 4k displays), dual-band 802.11n wireless networking, USB 3.0 ports (and one supports ASUS fast-charging technology which lets you quickly charge your cell phone or other devices), Bluetooth 4.0, a standard AC adapter port (for the included AC brick), SD card slot, and of course a headphone jack.<br/><br/>Other little bonuses that came with the Zenbook include a USB-to-Ethernet connector, a cable tie, and a microfiber cloth. Little things like that make it a nice package, and it's appreciated.<br/><br/>►THE GOOD NEWS<br/>Look, feel, speed, battery life... All seem to be excellent here. I can't complain about a thing so far. Simply put, this is a gorgeous, well-made ultrabook. From the 1080p matte screen, to the Bang & Olufson speakers, to the excellent keyboard, to the ability to handle most daily computing tasks, there's lots to like about this computer.<br/><br/>►THE BAD NEWS<br/>No backlit keyboard, and the Intel Core-M CPU will sometimes slow down a bit when the laptop battery gets very low (this is because it's trying to preserve battery life). Plugging it in will fix that problem. Neither of these minor issues is enough to cause me to lower the score, though.<br/><br/>►THE VERDICT<br/>Five freaking big stars! If you're in the market for a thin and light laptop that will last a long time on a charge, this is the one to get. Most of the competition at this point in time uses a Core i3 or Core i5 mobile processor and requires a fan for cooling. At this price point, the most direct competition offers HALF the RAM and SSD storage space. Honestly, the Zenbook UX305 is the obvious choice unless you're a hardcore gamer who (for some reason) wants to game on an ultrabook.<br/><br/>►SUMMARY:<br/>Awesome ultrabook. Quiet, cool, fast, pretty, and a really great price. Get one if you need a full-featured, lightweight Windows laptop.
As of September 2015, the market for the perfect all around laptop is sparse. The most common recommendation you find among consumers is the macbook air.  While the macbook air has had its own time reigning over the laptop market as king, that crown has been stripped over the years. Its yearly incremental upgrades, price, and underwhelming screen has left people wondering when a true update will happen to the macbook air line? Along with the release of Windows 10, now is the prime time to try out a windows based laptop. Is the Asus Zenbook UX305LA (horrid product naming) the successor of the kingdom, or does it fall short of high expectations?<br/><br/>Price: In terms of price alone this is miles better than the macbook air has to offer. As of September 29, 2015 the Asus Zenbook UX305LA is selling for the reasonable price of 749.99! Considering the base specs of these are compared to 1,199.00 for a new macbook air 13 inch.<br/><br/>Hardware: The hardware is actually quite excellent. Nice aluminium build. While the laptop is said to be gold colored it is more of a silver/bronze color, which in my opinion is much better looking than a tacky gold finish. Ports galore are found in this ultrabook; sd card reader, 3 USB ports, micro HDMI port, 3.5 mm headphone jack, and of course a battery port for the charger. The keyboard is... good. Very nice and good feeling key travel. No obvious flex in the typing experience. It is full featured minus a dedicated number pad which is expected in a 13 inch form factor. A major con for the keyboard is definitely the lack of back light. The trackpad is also good. Very responsive and clicky. If you do not a clicky trackpad this is not for you. I am in a small group that loves a satisfying click.<br/><br/>Screen: The display for the UX305LA is miles better than the macbook air's screen. However, let it be known some tweaking should be done in the settings. Calibration was a little off but after a few seconds in the settings it looks outstanding. Matte display that is great for outdoors and extreme lighting. Right above the display is the webcam. It is a webcam, I did not expect to much out of it (4K, 60 fps, studio quality mic.) or anything as great showing. It does 720p video suitable for Skype and Google Hangouts.<br/><br/>Software: This is very important. If you are heavily reliant on the apple ecosystem, then I will not recommend this laptop for you. Windows 10 is the operating system. While Apple has allowed iCloud to be accessed online and iTunes gets a refresh here and there, Apple has no support for the Windows software. I am a big fan of 10 and have found most programs I've been using for years work just as good and perhaps even better than they did in previous iterations. My complaint comes not on Microsoft's part but ASUS. ASUS has allowed a massive amount of "crapware" on this laptop. Pre-installing software like Mcafee, dropbox, evernote, and some others. My first hour was spent on uninstalling these programs.<br/><br/>Performance: With an intel i5, 8gb memory, and 256gb of storage this thing flies! Basic tasks like word processing, web browsing, and watching videos is done in a snap thanks to its ssd. Now as for harder tasks this performs a lot better than I expected. First I did some intensive tasks like video and photo editing which got a little warm but outstanding coming from such a thin device. Next I began to do a little bit of gaming. Downloaded Steam, then proceeded to play games like half-life 2 episode 2, the wolf among us, and to my surprise payday 2. All doing a solid 30-60 fps. Of course turning down the settings a bit helps, but definitely impressed with what the little guy can muster.<br/><br/>Battery Life: Battery life is.... GREAT! Yes this laptop suffers quite a bit with me from day to day tasks. Yet, I rarely am looking for a charger by the middle of the day. Near the end I am a little concerned but thanks to windows 10 power saving mode it always makes it. My days start at 10 A.M. to ( P.M. So the 12 hour battery life claim is close. Then again, I am using the thing pretty hard most of the day. In the end I give it 2 thumbs up.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Is this the macbook air killer? No. The only killer to the macbook air would be it's successor for the next generation. (And no the macbook 2015 is not it either, an under powered and overpriced facebook browser). The Asus UX305LA is however, a mighty competitor. If it weren't for the lack of keyboard back light or the preinstalled crapware, I would say this is the new king of the laptop market. Nevertheless, the UX305LA is in my honest opinion a better overall value and choce when compared to the macbook air and I am happy to say this is my new daily laptop. 5 out 5 stars ASUS, well done.<br/><br/>Update: 10/29/2015<br/>My review has been updated. Still performs great... when you're not online. Seriously disappointed in the issues I'm having. As some have posted in their reviews, WiFi is very spotty. I do not have the pleasure of always using Ethernet but most likely on the convenience of WiFi.(I'm a student always on the go) The fact that my $250 smartphone is more reliable than my laptop is flat out awful. If I'm paying a hefty price for such a laptop I expect something as simple as a WiFi reciever to work well, not even good. Keep this in mind when purchasing this laptop. Bad WiFi receiver is a definite deterant and I am going to look into returning this product. (I am writing this review on my phone because the laptop's wifi reciever is not working AGAIN) Thought ASUS really did make a "no compromise" ultrabook priced competitively... Unfortunately I thought wrong.
I wanted an alternative to the Macbook Air that would run Linux as an operating system. Installing Linux on a Mac is possible but very difficult. Windows laptops are much more flexible for installing Linux and there are many ultrabooks coming out right now. You can buy a laptop with Linux preinstalled, but the options are very limited. System76 does the best job, but none of their laptops are as thin as the Macbook Air. Also, there are Linux laptops from high-end custom manufacturers like AVADirect, but those are unnecessarily expensive for a Linux laptop.<br/><br/>The box comes with the laptop, charger, and USB to Ethernet adapter. The laptop hardware is beautiful just like a Mac and it has a good selection of ports. The keyboard is decent, but the trackpad and screen are on the lower-end. If you are editing photos and video and color accuracy is important to you, then you might want to look elsewhere. The screen is fine for my normal use so I will just replace the trackpad with an external mouse. Also, I haven't even tested the speakers since you should just plug in a headset anyway.<br/><br/>Once you turn on the laptop for the first time, test Windows first to make sure that nothing is defective. Make sure you find your Windows OEM product key just in case you need to install Windows again and write it down on paper. Then, disable secure boot in the BIOS and boot off of your Linux USB installer. Click try Linux before installing to test that it works before you wipe Windows off of your machine.<br/><br/>On Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, the wireless works automatically which is nice. Even the function keys for turning the volume up and down work automatically. The install went smoothly and using the OS works overall. However, Linux compatibility on newer laptops is never perfect. If you are installing Linux on this laptop, you should not be afraid to get your hands dirty and fix some problems by manually updating the kernel and applying some display driver patches found elsewhere.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Asus has overlooked some details. When you open the laptop, the bottom of the screen holds the laptop slightly above the surface. It actually does not grip the surface as well as when it is closed and on hard surfaces I worry that it will get scratched. One of the major selling points of this laptop is that it is silent and that is absolutely true except for the excessively loud click of the trackpad. Overall though, the hardware is good and the software is good too with the laptop's Linux compatibility. I just wish Asus would sell these with Ubuntu LTS preinstalled to make the process easier.<br/><br/>Other thoughts:<br/>I DO NOT recommend Dell XPS laptops for Linux. There are either problems with the hardware or the Linux compatibility is very bad.<br/>If you do plan on using Windows, then get the Microsoft Signature Edition without all of the preinstalled software.<br/><br/>Update:<br/>I actually decided to return this laptop. I am still giving it four stars because it still is “one of the best ultrabooks for Linux,” but you can find better laptops for Linux if you look for laptops that are slightly larger and don't quite meet ultrabook standards.
Let me start off by saying this; I love this laptop, I really do. However despite how much I love it, it still has flaws. None of these flaws are significant enough for me to consider this thing useless of less than a fine piece of hardware. Make no mistakes, this is a fine piece of hardware that most users will be thrilled with, but there are a few small things that hold it back from me giving it five stars. Really quickly, I'd like to provide some perspective about where I am coming from when I use this computer. I have been for the past year or so now been using a monster of a desktop pc. This pc has a core i7-4790k running at 4.6Ghz on an ASUS sabertooth mark 2 mother board, these are paired up with a Radeon R7 290x (Yes weird graphics choice but I had one lying around). For peripherals I was using a corsair K70 with Cherry MX Blues, and a corsair M65. All of these things I built myself. So I know my way around a computer and I have been spoiled with hard ware for the last year or so.<br/><br/>That all said, lets talk about the thing everyone really is concerned about. It seems to me that a lot of the negativity surrounding this laptop is aimed at the admittedly not great sounding 0.8Ghz dual core Core M. I admit at first I was skeptical of what this basically glorified tablet processor would be capable of. Now I can say without a doubt that any tablet with a core M is a monster! This laptop is quick, not fast, but quick. Most of this can be traced to its lighting fast M.2 SSD and its capacious ram. These two things make the laptop seem fast because significantly less time is required to access files. So when opening up chrome for example, there is little difference between this and my i7 beast. (I should mention that the desktop also has a SSD) Now there is a difference, the desktop opens everything except the largest programs immediately, this opens things just a little slower. This difference is honestly inconsequential, this laptop is more than fast enough to feel quick and responsive. That said when actual cpu intensive loads show their faces, this thing can get backed into a corner. For example, loading larger web pages takes noticeably longer on the laptop compared to the desktop, which again is instantaneous. Another area where this falls a little behind is multi tasking. On my desktop multitasking priorities do not exist, I can have as many things open and running as I want and apart from a little increase in fan noise, nothing changes. This is not the case here, while there is not fan noise, which is awesome, you are fairly limited to one task. I remember running a round of anti-spy ware software upon start up and then heading to chrome to do some browsing, a task that is more than easy on my desktop. I was a little disappointed  when I found out that I could not do this. The loading times of everything became unbearably slow and borderline useless. Oh well, not the end of the world but something to keep in mind.<br/><br/>Next up; the screen and audio. First of all the screen is absolutely fantastic. Full 1080p60 with 76% SRGB color range. That was the thing I was impressed with first, and is still what I am most impressed with. It is very bright and colors look great from almost every angle. I was used to a glossy screen before so it took a tiny bit of getting used to but the lack of glare really makes it worth it. The only real negative about the screen is a fairly significant amount of back-light bleed on dark screens. That is me looking for things to complain about though, the only time I actually ever noticed it was during the start-up splash screen. The audio, well, yeah, it sucks. Lets make this extremely clear right now; THIS DOES NOT HAVE BANG AND OLUFSEN SPEAKERS. The only thing made by Bang and Olufsen in this laptop is the sound encoder. In all honesty the sound encoder in question is actually pretty average, which shocks some people when they check out Bang and Olufsen's website. That said it is no doubt a huge upgrade over what may have been put in here otherwise so it gets brownie points. The headphone experience is very good with a few exceptions, and those exceptions come in the form of the genuinely shocking software pre-installed for audio control. The software is chunky, useless and many times would not even close properly. Not a huge deal, just remove it...but man was it bad.<br/><br/>Next up, key board and track pad. The key board was also a huge change of pace for me. Coming off of a top of the line mechanical keyboard to this guy was definitely a step down, but not as much as I was expecting. Yes the key stroke is very shallow, but aside from that the keyboard is excellent. The keys are some of the best balanced keys I have ever used and you will never have a missed stroke. They are also perfectly weighted and incredibly tactile, especially for how shallow of space they have to work with. They are however not back-lit which is not an issue for me, and the placement of the trackpad forces you to shift your hand ever so slightly when typing. The trackpad is also wonderful, there have been lots of complaints about it that I can't understand. Most important to me is its accuracy, its flawless, nuff said. The right and left click are for the most part easily distinguished although you might misplace a click from time to time. Multitasking gestures work absolutely perfectly and without and hesitation. Now the thing people all seem to hate, the fact that the trackpad clicks. If you are someone who hates trackpads that actually depress for a left click, then this thing will drive you mad, but as someone who loves this I have been thrilled. The click is very crisp and tactile if not just a tad heavy. The one complaint I have is how loud the click is, its honestly startling. The first time I clicked on something it shocked me. Its unfortunately loud and its really almost unacceptably so, but given the excellent nature of the rest of it I would let it go.<br/><br/>Build Quality and I/O. The build quality is outstanding, it really is. The aluminum makes it feel like a premium device and gives it a very nice rigid feel. There is not a single thing on this that I have encountered that didn't feel absolutely perfectly made. As an added bonus, its to have a laptop that you can throw around with one hand. The I/O is very good in my mind, its not the best for a laptop but given its size I think its about right. It has three USB 3.0 headers with one being capable of quick charging, a four pole headphone jack, a card reader, and micro-HDMI. The card reader was a really nice add on as I see a lot of people using this laptop on vacations and the like to off load cameras and things like that. My only gripe here is the micro-HDMI. micro-HDMI cables are not easy to find and hooking up to literally any kind of display will require some kind of goofy adapter that you almost certainly not be able to find at walmart should you forget to bring it on a business trip. Oh well first world problem.<br/><br/>Finally, things that kind of suck. All other things listed above are just things I was looking for to provide objective information. This is where I will complain about the stuff that just plain sucks. First of all, fan-less laptop technology, while damn close to being perfected, is not. This is really the only downside to this laptop, heat issues. First of all when watching movies for example, the passive cooling of the laptop will make most of the chassis of the laptop very warm, not even half as bad as previous laptops, but still some. This kind of sucks, but not nearly as badly as when you plug it in. If the battery gets low and you plug this sucker in while watching movies, well look out, you'll catch fire. It gets so hot on the bottom that it almost hurts to touch and as a result the CPU throttles so badly the video playback will begin to stutter and basically render movie watching impossible. This really sucks, and the only thing you can do to prevent it is either cool it somehow, or plug it in before the battery gets super low. If the battery is above 40 ish percent it doesn't seem to have any issues. The only other thing that kind of sucks, is its inability to play 1080p60 video. Now you might be thinking "wait before you said this thing had a 1080p60 panel in it" it does. But it cannot keep up with video over 1080p30, 720p60 runs just fine, but 1080p60 gets all kinds of little stutters during playback. This totally bummed me out because I was really looking forward to watching some great youtube content on this beautiful screen, oh well. It also seems to be a little picky on wi-fi, but our house may be having some issues all around, ill update.<br/><br/>In conclusion this is a great laptop that I absolutely love. There are a few little things that you can pic at if you look for them, and some things that will most likely come to annoy the hell out of you, but what kind of laptop doesn't? All in all this laptop is extremely well built, good looking, and a great performer 85% of the time, the other 15% could mostly be fixed with better cooling. I personally feel like if I were to do it again, I'd have gone with the i5 version so I could multi-task a little better and watch my 1080p60 video. But with outstanding battery and more than enough power as a backup computer, I have to say its pretty excellent.
There are a lot of good reviews for this item, so I will make this short but sweet for anyone having doubts on this laptop vs. a few other options. (Since I couldn't make up my mind and ordered 3 over the last week.)<br/><br/>Asus Zenbook UX305FA-ASM1 vs. Dell XPS 13 13ULT-7144sLV vs. Surface Pro 3 (128 GB, Intel Core i5)<br/><br/>Yes, the Zenbook has less power than the other 2 above, however, because of this lack of power (Intel M), there was an unforeseen advantage for me. I.E., Fanless! This is a HUGE deal when you are putting your laptop through its paces... because both the Dell and Surface 3 get LOUD. Loud and hot. And the Zenbook gets neither! Yes, there is a little bit of heat near the F9 key when the Intel M processor is pushing the limit (~2Ghz), but it is not nearly the same temperature as the Surface's top right hand corner, for instance.<br/><br/>This is what I had open and used to measure processing power, temperature, and audible fan speed:<br/><br/>- Pono (J-river media player), playing FLAC files.<br/>- Fostex HP-A4 DAC outputting the files above.<br/>- Chrome, 10+ tabs, including Google Play uploading function which takes a considerable amount of resources itself.<br/>- Norton Anti-Virus in the background.<br/>- Other background processes, i.e., Wi-Fi full blast, file transfers from external drive via usb 3.0, asus, onedrive, and google drive web storages consistently updating.<br/><br/>The Zenbook never got above 90 degree CPU temp, 50% Ram (~4GB), and CPU was at 100% only during the Google Play uploading. Otherwise was mostly hovering around 10-30% depending on tasks. Let's just say the Dell and SP3 both sounded like vacuum cleaners running at full blast with a portable heater blowing in my face. :)<br/><br/>Tldr; buy the Zenbook, you (and your ears) will not be disappointed.
I purchased the UX305 from Microsoft and not on Amazon, but the review is still relevant to this specific product.<br/><br/>First off I want to note that this is not a powerhouse computer - no computer at $700 and less is a powerhouse computer. For the price you are getting some great specs and great hardware. Heck the $1300 macbook 12" has the same specs (reletively). The hard drive is fast the RAM is adequate for most everyone, the screen is bright and very pleasant to view and the battery life is great. I really like the keyboard on this unit and am able to type just as quick as on larger laptops and desktop keyboards. Everything just feels very well done and feels more expensive than what you are paying. This is a far cry different than the HP 17" I have been using. I can carry this in a bag along with its power adapter, an ipad and its power adapter for basically the same weight as just the bag that held my larger laptop without the laptop in it. It is incredible how portable this laptop is and how well it works in my daily work in the courthouse and airplanes. I use this machine for web research and surfing - some video watching, spreadsheets, emails, word docs and some mapping. It can handle most of this without a hickup. The mapping part is not as easy as it is on larger more powerful units with dedicated graphics - but this machine was not designed to do this task. I can deed plot just fine, but it starts to lag when working in GIS software. Not a deal breaker for me.<br/><br/>Issues:<br/>-Windows 8 (enough said), but it doesn't mean a star needs to be taken off the laptop... and hey windows 10 is coming out in a couple months (depending on when you are reading this).<br/>-The trackpad is pretty darn good compared to many other windows laptops I have tried during my shopping, but it does not have the option to reverse the two-finger scrolling and its multi touch setting are a little finicky. It is a little loud when clicking - doesn't bother me much at all. sometimes it thinks I am three finger swiping and will minimize my current program (rare) or sometimes thinks I am trying to zoom in/out (less rare).<br/><br/>I purchased the signature edition of this machine from Microsoft so it does not have any of the extra software that computer manufacturers throw on their machines. That said it is probably a little faster than the normal ones from Asus. I really like using the machine and have suggested it to many of my co-workers - some of whom have gone off and purchased it after trying mine. For the money I don't think there is anything out there as good or near as good. There are more powerful machines like the XPS 13, but its going to cost you some serious coin to get the 256gb ssd and the 8gb ram - about $1100 for that version of the XPS 13. I personally will save the $400 - I don't really need the Core i5 processor that much for internet, big spreadsheets, some mapping. It would be nice, but not needed. I also got my ux305 on sale for only $599 so the argument was that much bigger for the Asus.
<br/><br/>
Just FYI this review pertains to the UX305LA not the UX305FA. For some reason it seems like the reviews for both models are in the same place which was confusing for me when trying to figure out how good this laptop is.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>This Asus has got to be one of the best ultra book PC's on the market ever. I've had it for about a week now and it is compact and light, yet still extremely powerful. My boot time has been around 5-8 seconds and it takes about 2 seconds to wake up from sleep.<br/>I've also played some DOTA 2 on it and it has performed well, I didn't even hear the fan come on and the laptop didn't heat up at all like my old one used to. Granted DOTA 2 doesn't require much from the machine, but it proves this thing can handle some more intense tasks.<br/>The screen is also very nice. With 1080p and anti-glare it is extremely nice to look at. I've watched several movies and they have looked wonderful. I can also sit in a room or outside with bright sunlight and not have a problem seeing the display.<br/>The audio on this machine is the Bang & Olufsen speakers. They are quite small yet create a good amount of sound. Playing music from spotify sounds good and the base isn't even that bad.<br/>Battery life is also great. I can go to classes all day and continue using into the night at the library or something and still not to need to charge it. Basically this laptop has changed my life at school. I had a 6 kg Dell before this and it made my bag extremely heavy. Now I've been able to buy a small backpack and with this thing in it I don't even realize that anything is on my back.<br/>Cons:<br/>There are a few things that I'm not crazy about:<br/>1) When it first came the display drivers crashed a few times and the trackpad and speakers were not working. However, after going to the ASUS website and updating drivers it has been working like a charm.<br/>2) The keyboard is not backlit. While not an essential part of any laptop it would be nice if I could see the keys better at night. However, if you do turn the brightness up high on the display the keys will reflect the light which makes it easier to see them in the dark.<br/>3) Only micro HDMI. Obviously this was necessary due to space constraints, however, it would have been nice if I didn't have to buy adapters for my monitors and TV to connect to the laptop.<br/>4) The color. The titanium gold color is more of a rose gold color. Obviously this doesn't really matter, however, I would prefer if the computer was a little less pink. This goes out as a warning to all the people who don't like the color pink, this laptop is pretty pinkish.
::: Used this laptop to install Ubuntu Linux :::<br/>::: This is for the core i5 model, not the black one with the coreM :::<br/><br/>Amazing machine. I've been describing it as having the power of a Macbook Pro inside a Macbook Air. That is to say that it has MBP specs (almost, the CPU is slightly less powerful than the MBP) and is the size  and weight of an Air. I am using this to run Linux, mostly Ubuntu and Linux Mint so if you came here wondering if this was a good machine for Linux then this is for you.<br/><br/>Current setup: Ubuntu 14.04, Flatabulus theme, and Ultra Flat icon pack. Its the most beautiful OS I have ever seen. I am using this for day to day web browsing and full stack web development.<br/><br/>Price<br/>====<br/> $750 for these specs? SOLD. A 13 inch MBair is $250 more expensive with significantly worse specs. Next runner up is the Dell XPS13 which is again, much more expensive and has worse specs. You can't beat this.<br/><br/>The Screen<br/>=========<br/> The screen is MATTE full HD (1920x1080) which is great to look at. Because it's a matte screen, there is virtually no glare at all. It's hard enough to find matte screen these days and even harder for an ultrabook and I loath glossy screens so I instantly fell in love with this screen. My only complaint is that the resolution might be too high, the text is pretty small and requires just a little strain to read.<br/><br/>Battery<br/>======<br/> I 'm getting about 5 1/2 hours of battery life on this. Asus claims to have a 10 hour battery life for Windows which I cannot confirm since I have installed Linux, and Linux has always had a rocky relationship with batteries. Lowering the screen brightness seems to help, and I am currently exploring other power saving options but 5 /12 hours is fine with me as I am never away from a plug for that long.<br/><br/>Keyboard<br/>=======<br/>The keyboard is taking me a little time to get used to. My last laptop also had one of these recessed kayboards but the keys stuck out more and had more of a mechanical feeling while typing, so I have a few more typos now but again it's just something I will need time to get used to. It was also a little larger so I had dedicated keys for things like page-up/page-down and home/end and that's actually kind of a big deal. It's been difficult for me to jump around my documents as I am typing because I have to remember that I now need to press the FN key and one of the arrow keys.  The center of the keyboard seems a little flimsy so sometimes I see the keyboard bend in while Im typing.<br/><br/>Notes - No backlit keyboard which sucks but its not the worst thing I guess. The screen brightness keys do NOT work at all. Those are the keys that require pressing the FN button and then f5/f6. So youll either have to adjust it manually (I've only had to adjust it once to about 60%) or use these instructions:<br/>https://www.reddit.com/r/ASUS/comments/301lpy/linux_on_asus_zenbook_ux305/cuwr5n7<br/><br/>Trackpad<br/>=======<br/>The trackpad is fine, no complaints. It worked out of the box with full trackpad settings (stuff like tap to click, two finger scrolling ect).<br/><br/>Wireless<br/>=======<br/> This worked out of the box but I do seem to be having issues staying connected to my network. Not sure what is happening yet but every so often DNS will stop resolving and I will have to reconnect to my router. It might be the router tho, I've been having issues with my chromecast.<br/><br/>Camera<br/>======<br/>I dont use webcams that much anyway so I have a hard time comparing to anything. Resolution seems fine, motion tracking seems a bit sluggish I guess? I mean, its fine for me almost non-existent skype/hangouts session.<br/><br/>Speakers<br/>========<br/>Tbh these aren't the greatest. They are located on the bottom of the machine and unless you are using the laptop on a hard surface like a desk it's not very loud. So I guess my desk is amplifying the sound, but it sounds muffled when on my lap. I generally use headphones anyway but it would be nice if they were on top and louder so I could play videos for people.<br/><br/>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::<br/>TLDR: Great machine for Linux. But it now.<br/>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::<br/><br/>Pros - Beautiful, beautiful matte screen with zero glare. Incredibly lightweight but still powerful. Great specs for its size, heck they're great specs in general.  Decent battery life, all hardware works out of the box which is a HUGE pro. Portability is amazing, sometimes I forget it's even in my bag. For this price, its a GREAT machine<br/><br/>Cons - No backlit keyboard (not a big deal but they look so nice), apparently the RAM is soldered onto the mainboard so it cannot be upgraded (if you want to run multiple VMs this might be an issue) but 8gigs is OK for my need. Screen brightness key does not work in Linux. No dedicated page-up/page-down/home/end keys is really difficult for me to get used to. I wish the battery life was longer on Linux, 10 hours would be amazing. Speakers aren't the best
after 3 months, started getting vertical lines all down the screen, becoming quite distracting and getting worse
I have been on a quest to find a laptop replacement for quite a long time. I've returned about a half dozen other laptops because of ongoing problems such as an unreliable internet connection, flimsy and weak design, poor screen quality, etc. The list goes on and on and after a few months of trying other brands like MSI, Lenovo and two new Toshiba Satellite laptops I was at my wits end as far as what other brands to try out.<br/><br/>I am a member of several forums and asked for some suggestions as far as other brands to try. One of the overwhelming repeated responses I read in the replies was that ASUS was a very good and solid brand. I didn't have much experience in the past with ASUS but did my research and now I wound up with this laptop. You will see that this review is not coming from a "verified purchase stamp" here on amazon.com. That is because I wound up buying this laptop from the Microsoft Store in the Seattle area. It was on sale for $599 so I decided to snatch one up.<br/><br/>The speed, battery life, portability, solid metal body and design and the colorful screen all get five stars. The main reasons I returned a very recent Toshiba Satellite laptop was because you had to view the screen from a very specific angle in order to see a bright screen. The moment you were too high or too low the brightness and colors on a Toshiba Satellite laptop look very faded and washed out. For a $1,600 laptop I didn't find this acceptable at all. This ASUS Zenbook does not have this problem. The colors and brightness diminish a bit if you move from side to side but that's negligible compared to when you move your head up and down or if you find yourself slouching or sitting back up. I found that to be an annoyance with the Toshiba Satellite.<br/><br/>I get nearly ten hours of internet browsing time without the laptop plugged in which is phenomenal. I have never had such long batter life with other laptops. In fact, I never really relied or cared that a laptop could run on its battery alone. I just like laptops for their portability but usually kept them plugged in because they typically wouldn't give me much unless connected to an outlet.<br/><br/>I've also never had a laptop before that had a metal body. All the other ones were plastic. Even though the ASUS Zenbook is made of metal it is incredibly light and it's small size fits so easily in my backpack and I can't feel its weight while zipping around town either on foot or while riding my bicycle. My prior laptops have been 17" in terms of screen size but downgrading to this 13" size doesn't feel like a compromise. The screen really is a joy to look at and reading text is perfectly fine.<br/><br/>The overall speed is great and I love traveling with this laptop.<br/><br/>The only reason why I am taking off a star is because I have grown to resent the mouse pad. It sometimes makes me jump all over the place while I'm typing which can really slow me down when I'm trying to type a bunch of text. In fact, it has jumped to different areas three times while writing this review. I'm not sure why this is happening but the size of everything on the screen will sometimes shrink or enlarge when I had no intention of doing so. I have to click and hold CTRL and "-" or "+" in order to fix the nuisance. If anyone can provide me with instructions on how to "desensitize" the mouse pad in order to fix the problem I will happily change my review and give it a five star rating. If I have to spend money to buy a wireless mouse I will leave my review with its current four star review. Spending more money is not a solution as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>This last part doesn't factor into my review. I just wanted to mention it hoping that ASUS might be listening. I think this little gizmo would be even more phenomenal if it had a back-lit keyboard. I wasn't all that used to the chiclet style keyboard, as this model has, but it is growing on me. All of the prior laptops that I purchased within the last few months all had back-lit which is wonderful when typing late at night. Having this feature eliminates the need for me to turn on any lights. This is especially useful when using the laptop in bed.<br/><br/>Other than the mouse pad annoyance I am very happy with my purchase. Now that I am familiar with the ASUS brand and what appears to be a solid quality product I look forward to buying more of their products in the future. I'd like to eventually buy a heavy duty laptop (more power and speed) for video editing in the near future. My Zenbook will be my go to laptop for quick computing, web browsing and especially for being my companion when I travel.
I was looking for a computer for my senior semester and early graduation gift and almost immediately saw this one for 699. Core M, 256 GB SSD, 8gb RAM, ½ inch, it’s a winner! Coming from a series of inexpensive and under powered computers I was not going to be misled by reviewers suggesting sluggishness for everyday use when it’s still about twice as powerful as my Dell I3147, but what I was somewhat concerned with the complaints of a loud and below average track-pad and heat issues.<br/><br/>I’ll admit the track-pad is loud and is not incredibly sensitive tapping or two-finger scrolling on Windows, but after turning edge swipe features off it is easy to use and is not incredibly erratic like other track-pads I’ve encountered. Hopefully with a driver update we will be able to tweak it. During the fresh install performed, the computer did get warm but not hot on the bottom and top right of the case. However, based on the actual ability for heat dissipation compared to other Core M machines (http://www.anandtech.com/show/9117/analyzing-intel-core-m-performance), it should not be anything to worry about. I think some complaints of the UX305 becoming ‘hot’ are caused by using it under heavy use on laps which would impair the heat dissipation from the bottom aluminum panel. Since there is no fan the bottom and top are the only places for this dissipation to occur. There are settings in the advanced power settings menu to change the TDP to low, nominal, and high, so changing it from high to nominal or low would reduce heat, but I’m unsure the degree of impact it will have on performance.<br/><br/>The performance of this machine is absolutely fantastic. For everyday tasks like writing, multitasking between browsers and programs, and videos the M-5y10 performs perfectly. For those a little more keen on numbers, I ran Peacekeeper benchmark (it simulates more of my usage than any other benchmarking tool since I do no gaming or picture/video editing) and the UX305 scored a 2855 in Windows and 3457 in Ubuntu. I ran it along my I3147 with an SSD and ULV Pentium quad-core, which got a 1303 in Windows – all fresh installs. According to the article mentioned above, the M-5y10 in the UX305 scored much better in most benchmarks than its higher clocked sibling since the Zenbook was able to keep cooler and a more consistent turbo than the Dell with a 1.2ghz/2.9ghz Core M. Just for kicks, I tested Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas (2008 & 2010) and the gameplay on Ultra-High resolution never stuttered below 30FPS and the SOC and CPU temps never climbed above 150F while playing on a surface. This was similar heat (136-140F) for watching videos, but because of the fanless design, I probably wouldn't play demanding games too much to avoid reducing the CPU lifespan - other laptops have fans that kick in and drop the temperature to 120f or so, but this will just stay the same throughout intensive use.<br/><br/>The keyboard is absolutely the best I have ever owned or used. There is less travel but the keys are spaced excellently and there is a lot of feedback, also I am confident the letters will shows up when the button is pressed – not something I can say of the last three machines I have used. I discovered if the middle of the computer is put over one leg the keys requires significantly more force to press.<br/><br/>The battery life is also excellent - 7 hours video and usually 10-11 office-use.<br/><br/>#Update with Windows 10<br/>The computer is noticeably faster running windows 10 than 8.1. Battery life was initially about an hour less, but with a few batches of updates now it's about the same as with 8.1. Compatibility is great and the only drivers Windows 10 Does not automatically install are the chipset and DTPF.
The only thing truly missing is a backlit keyboard, but having said that, this is the best general purpose laptop that money can buy (especially if you got the offer on the microsoft store, for 599$).<br/><br/>Very speedy for general purpose use. I am a programmer and photo editor. Programming in Java and C is a breeze, thanks to the 8GB of RAM and the SSD. Photo editing is also very quick, with the only moments with some stutters are importing large quantities of RAW files into your lightroom library, and similar tasks.<br/><br/>Construction is solid. Props to ASUS for making such a nicely built laptop/ultrabook (or whatever you want to call it) for such a bargain price. We're talking about macbook 2015 quality, but with 3 USB 3.0 ports, micro hdmi, sd card reader. Only con is a light backlight bleed, noticeable only on back or very dark backgrounds and high brightness settings<br/><br/>Even some light gaming can be done on the Core M processor. I played some CSS, CS:GO and Portal 1 & 2 without major hiccups. Not a gaming pc by any means, but if will allow you to pass some time on light games.<br/><br/>The 1080p screen is great for size and pixel density, and i prefer it being matte and non touch, as those are extras not needed on a laptop. The non insane resolution on this particular model (FHD), is also a bonus for me, as it allows you to have a good compromise between screen real estate, and pixel density for text. MATTE is awesome.<br/>For the size, and for being extremely lightweight, it also has a very respectable 7+ hour battery life.<br/><br/>UBUNTU and other linux distros work wonderfully on this pc, and linux is also my primary os for this computer.<br/><br/>If you use a laptop as a laptop, buy it, you won't regret it. If you need desktop replacement power, look elsewhere.
Just received this laptop yesterday (the signature USM1 edition) and it's been fantastic so far. I unfortunately didn't keep track of how long the battery lasted me but it lasted for a significant amount of time. This package came with a screen cloth, a USB to gigabit ethernet adapter, the charger (of course), and an extra wire velcro tie.<br/><br/>I didn't experience any noticeable slowdowns during the entirety of my usage. I'm a web developer so the first thing I did was setup one of my development environments. I'm currently running WAMP/mysql and a node.js server with ATOM text editor. Along with those two local servers running I was running Chrome (with varying # of tabs from 7-15) and MySQL Workbench. Everything seemed to be lightning fast with everything opened and moving. The laptop to my surprise also stayed very cool. It warmed slightly in the center towards the bottom of the screen but everywhere my hands were felt cool to the touch. I'll eventually install Visual Studio and RStudio most likely and see how those run.<br/><br/>The reason why I rate this a 4/5 is because the trackpad seemed to be creating audible "click" noises when being tapped on. The noises seemed too loud to be normal (like the trackpad may have been loose). I submitted a customer server request and am waiting to hear back. Strange thing is though after I submitted the review and went mobile with my laptop, that problem seemed to stop. It does have a pretty audible press-down click though which should be noted before buying if you're the type of person that gets bothered by that.<br/><br/>I gave the speakers a try with a few different types of music. The audio level is fine and you can fine tune (as I did) the audio in the SmartAudio software they provide. The sound does come as a little flat/tinny but I would think that's expected from ultrabook speakers. I've got a Lenovo y500 with JBL Pro Speakers and those are significantly better.<br/><br/>I compared this with my girlfriend's Dell XPS 13 (2014 model, 128 GB SSD, 8 GB Ram, Touch screen, i5 processor). The ASUS was definitely longer and wider (probably due to the wider bezel) but was also definitely thinner and felt a little lighter as well. The keyboard has larger keys on the ASUS than the Dell XPS 13 does. Both keyboards are comfortable to type on but the XPS keyboard seems slightly quieter and softer. Overall when comparing performance, I realize that the XPS has an i5 that probably runs base at 1.4 or 1.6 GHz but the ASUS felt just as snappy running all my regular and web-dev related tasks as the XPS. The XPS fan would kick on after some time of coding, but the ASUS seemed to stay cool.<br/><br/>I have not installed windows office suite on it yet, nor have I used it to watch any movies with yet. If the trackpad didn't give me that strange, single occurrence problem I'd rate this laptop 5/5. Incredible price point meets good power, solid build (handling the brushed aluminmum body feels fantastic) and portability is how I would define this laptop.
Just received this today.... and it's a keeper. I was tossed between this and the Dell XPS13 (another superb choice) but the Dell would set me back a nearly double the price loaded the way I wanted it so I gave this one the go. I don't think I'll regret it. I won't go into specs details because the previous reviews already touched on them and you can see all the product specs that are readily available.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/>Superb build quality: solid as a brick yet light as a feather :-)<br/>Quiet smooth operation in almost everything I've thrown at it, except for Photoshop which I'll test soon.<br/>Loaded with just the right mix of ports and connections while keeping the unit just under half an inch thick<br/>Beautiful non glare monitor / screen which just the right amount of color saturation right out of the box<br/>Great full size keyboard that I'm very comfortable typing on with just enough feedback in touch<br/><br/>Good size touch pad thought I'm more comfortable with the bluetooth mouse I installed but I can see<br/>if I were to use the touch pad as my input device of choice I'd have to tweak it a bit.<br/><br/>One of the USB ports is actually a charging USB port you can use to charge your cellphone or other<br/>USB connected devices and it works with the PC on or off!<br/><br/>Beautiful almost black aluminum case gives the PC a professional appearance but I plan on not only<br/>carrying it in a laptop case but getting a neoprene sleeve for it to protect it from scratches. I only say<br/>this because the casing has a brushed aluminum circles pattern and if you scratch it, it's going to be<br/>pretty obvious and ruin the aesthetics.<br/><br/>I've read some off site reviews that said the speakers were not loud enough but simply changing the<br/>"Enhancement" settings in the speaker setting area to "Phantom Speakers" gave the sound a boost in loudness<br/>though I wouldn't call it quality sound. The reviewers they may have been let down<br/>by the fact that the company lists the sound as having Audio by ICEPower and Bang & Olufsen Technology.<br/>Sounds like a big deal doesn't it? :-)  I'm not a big fan of speaker ports located on the bottom of a laptop<br/>but with less than a half of an inch to call a computer they must have had to make choices on what goes where.<br/>Personally I use bluetooth headphones for my listening pleasure.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/>not much but the lack of a lighted keyboard may be an issue for those who find that an important feature<br/>and the delete key on the keyboard is rather small and in an out of the way location (for me anyway)<br/><br/>EDIT: Feb 25th 2015<br/>Just wanted to update this with a few observations<br/>1. This computer starts up and shuts down faster than ANY computer I've ever owned. I would say faster than a Kindle Fire<br/>2. There's absolutely nothing wrong with the trackpad on this computer, it works quite well but I use a USB mouse instead<br/>3. Did not realize you can not remove the battery. But recharging the battery is speedy and holds a charge well<br/>4. There's some "bloatware" on the computer but it's easily removed by right clicking the icon for the program and clicking uninstall<br/>5. Case Logic makes a 13 inch neoprene zippered sleeve that this fits in.... perfectly. Amazon has the best price on it.<br/>Went to best buy to try to find a 13 inch zipper sleeve and best they could do was a 69.00 waste of time, I paid about 20 bucks for mine!<br/>6. I also bought a customized 13" sleeve that I personalized on http://ideisgncafe.com which I paid more for but was worth the customization and shows off my Zenbook in style<br/>7. No lighted keyboard? Who cares! I just use the USB light I purchased here on Amazon to light it perfectly in a darkened room.
I bought a brand new ASUS Zenbook and it only turned on once after unboxing. The next day it ceased to work (after closing the lid on it for the night, leaving it charged). The charging light appeared orange, and then green once it was fully charged, but when I press the power button, the only perceptible behavior is a tinny whirring, and the tiny LEDs under the power, caps lock, and airplane mode buttons to light up and fade out a few seconds later.
Don't pay too much attention to the clocked speed of the processor.<br/><br/>I was pretty skeptical at first, and to be honest I was really on the fence about getting a notebook with a processor under 1GHz.Everything else was exactly what I was looking for, especially the 1920x1080 resolution, which is harder to find at a similar price point. After looking at other machines with the same kind of form factor and similar specifications, I took the plunge and bought this one. I'm very happy. With the SSD and 8GB of RAM, it certainly does not feel slow at all. Everything is very snappy and UI elements are crisp and sharp. As I'm writing this, the battery is sitting at 98% and telling me slightly more than 10 hours are left on the charge, this being with auto brightness on (pretty low, though) and the processor currently reporting in at 998MHz.<br/><br/>The computer feels solid, the keys on the keyboard feel nice and don't click as I type like the cheaper versions of chiclet keys, and the ports on this thing outnumber most other machines in this weight class it seems. The best part: ASUS took the high road and put a great Windows image on this thing - the OS with a fair patching, all the drivers, and that's it; no bloatware, no crappy trials... just a nice, clean, fresh OS. Kudos, ASUS.<br/><br/>I have ONE complaint, and it is only a minor one, at most - the trackpad. The trackpad fits the machine in terms of design, but the clicking action is a little loud for my taste. I'm also used to a separate button(s) for the trackpad, and perhaps this why I'm having issues right now, but if you're trying to click on things you just can't have two fingers on the trackpad. My mode of operation is to have my thumb on the left mouse button and my index finger doing the tracking, but with this style of trackpad that tends to result in misclicks and slightly incorrect highlights.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm definitely happy with this purchase and would do it again in a heartbeat. A word to the wise - if you're going to reformat, be sure to make a clone of the drive; it comes with a recovery partition that makes restoring to "factory default" easy, and I'd say that's a nice thing to keep around.
I bought the Asus Zenbook based on reviews, both here on Amazon and other PC websites.  I needed to edit documents on the go and surf the internet without having to charge as much as possible.  For the money, the Zenbook met all of my requirements.  I'm still learning Windows 8.1, but so far so good.  If you need to a computer to simultaneously play video games and edit 4K movies, then spend some real money and get a more expensive computer with all the specs you are looking for.  If you need a workhorse to edit PDFs and word documents, surf the internet, or engage any other moderate processor tasks, then don't hesitate to buy this laptop.<br/><br/>I wish it had a backlit keyboard, but for the money it's a steal.  Fanless Core M Processor, no moving-parts hard drive, plenty of RAM, 3 x USB 3.0 ports, SD card reader, mini hdmi.....all for $700?  Stop wasting your time like I did and buy this sucker.
At first I was very skeptical about this computer... mostly because the processors base speed is only 800 MHz, which I felt might not work at all well. However, I wanted a laptop primarily for word-processing, browsing the internet, streaming video, light photoshop and some other work-related programs. Nothing too intensive, so I decided to risk it since the $699 price tag was quite appealing and most of the reviews I was able to find for this machine were very very positive.<br/><br/>  In the reviews I have found, there are the same four (edit: 6!) complaints over and over I have heard. Those being i) that the screen has some kind of weird stripe when viewed from a certain angle, which I can't say I have noticed, ii) that the keyboard isn't backlit ... honestly I don't find this to be a problem in the slightest, iii) internet connectivity problems, particularly at coffee shops - I have so far taken this to 5 or 6 coffee shops, and only once did I experience a problem, where the network could not be found and this was fixed by restarting the computer... however, it turned out to be a pretty crappy connection as confirmed from others in the area, iv) heating issues when doing intensive tasks, I have noticed it got a little warm after streaming a 2 hr movie, but nothing too bad ... oh and v) a few people mentioned they didn't like where the delete key is (next to the power key)... but honestly again this has not been a problem. ... and vi) the speakers are pretty weak! ... this one I agree with completely.<br/><br/>  The construction is extremely high quality. I think the keyboard is one of the best I have ever used, second to the 11" macbook air which I also like. Its a chiclet style keyboard with little travel, but personally I like that a lot and have found my typing speeds have been faster than on any keyboard I have used previously...<br/><br/>  The processor is passively cooled, since it is only 4.5W... and from the reviews I have seen elsewhere this model features the lowest speed processor available, it actually performs a lot better than the higher clock speed versions which are throttled by poor cooling in some of these designs. When monitoring the processor speed it actually dynamically alters the speed a lot and has no issue bumping up to 2 GHz when under duress! In fact, I have found this computer to be extremely snappy and responsive, which may be in part due to the excellent SSD installed. It comes in two 128 GB partitions with a generous 256 GB total. You can probably reformat if you don't like this, but actually keeping your data and the programs/operating system separate is not a bad idea and something I usually do. It also comes with 16 GB cloud storage if you are into that kind of thing... The 8GB of ram is more than most people will need. I haven't tried many games on this yet, but from what I have seen the integrated graphics is actually quite capable of running games on their lower settings. The screen quality is great I think, at 1080p movies look good. I feel like I may have noticed the screen brightness changing a little during certain scenes while streaming, but my TV also does this while streaming netflix so it may not actually be due to the laptop?<br/><br/>  The sound volume is perhaps a little bit low - although there is no fan, so no noise from the computer which means you can still watch movies/listen to music okay but if you are expecting to be able to use a laptop speakers to listen to something, it's quite likely you don't care that much about sound volume/quality anyway - just plug in headphones or decent speakers for much better quality experience on almost any laptop out there!<br/><br/>  The battery charges in ~ 2 hours, and under normal working on the computer have been able to get much more than 10 hours of use from this machine... this is impressive because windows machines normally get about half the amount of macs/linux. Under heavy use (streaming video/music and playing games at max volume and brightness) this went down to 5-6 hours, which is still pretty good.<br/><br/>  Given its small size there are a lot of ports on it, including 3 USB and a micro HDMI... headphones, power, some kind of media port I have never and will probably never use...<br/><br/>  For the price, you are getting an amazing little laptop here! Also, there is the signature version available (check microsoft website, this was apparently available at $699, whereas on amazon I think it is $829?) which has no bloatware installed, and also there is a higher-res version coming out. Actually I didn't notice a lot of bloatware, and installed bitdefender free which is fairly low impact on your systems resources.<br/><br/>  So far, I don't have any problems with the computer at all... working very well. Nice job ASUS... First time I was impressed enough with a product to actually write a review, if that is saying anything....
The ASUS Zenbook UX305FA is a great ultraportable notebook that delivers well-balanced performance in an incredibly thin-and-light package.  The notebook has a dual-core/four-thread Intel Core M processor which gives it great battery life and can ramp up the power if necessary.  It has a 256 GB SSD and 8 GB of RAM which is more than enough for casual or light office work.  The screen is a 1080p IPS display and is sharp and bright with great viewing angles.  The screen's small physical size of 13.3 inches causes Windows 8.1 to scale its fonts larger by default and that does affect the display of certain poorly-written applications, making them appear blurry, but this feature can be turned-off.  This notebook is so thin that there is no built-in Ethernet port for those who choose to plug-in to their networks, but ASUS does include an Ethernet-to-USB dongle in the box, so it will take up one of the Zenbook's 3 USB 3.0 ports, but most people will probably be using it on 802.11n WiFi anyway so it's not a big deal.<br/><br/>One drawback to the design is that opening up the screen beyond 90 degrees will cause the screen to prop the back of the laptop off the surface it's resting on.  The rubber feet on the underside of the laptop are too thin to raise it high enough to prevent this.  ASUS has recognized this and placed tiny rubber feet on the edges of the screen so the casing itself doesn't really contact the surface.  One sad omission is the lack of a backlit keyboard, but I guess that would add to the thickness and cost.<br/><br/>Another dig against it is the out-of-the-box experience.  Once you complete the initial operating system setup, be prepared for a couple of hours of patching as ASUS chose not to slipstream any recent Microsoft Security updates with their software image.  As of April 2015, you would have to install 130+ updates alone before the operating system is at a current patch level.  The Zenbook's hard drive is also partitioned equally into a C and D drive.  You can easily delete the D drive and extend the C partition in the Computer Management console.<br/><br/>TLDR: Great ultraportable laptop with a few flaws.  Good office performance and battery life.
I waited for around a month before I wrote a small review for this laptop as I wanted to give the computer some time to break in. What I have found-----I love it.<br/><br/>I looked at computers for well over a year (no joke) to make sure I was buying something that could keep up with my lifestyle and job. I am a chemist working on my PhD, and although I tend not to run any software that is too large on my laptop (I use desktops in the lab for that), I still needed something with a little power and portability. I wanted to keep my price under 1000, so that immediately ruled out Apple, which is fine. I have found that this computer with the same specs cost around 1300 for the Mac Air (which it looks virtually identical too; really it does); almost 2x the cost. Dell, Lenovo, HP, all had individual issues I was not happy with. Dell: 13 inch was floppy and expensive when looking at the 7000 series. Lenovo: poor reviews for this  and last years models, and not impressed when handling. HP: overpriced if you ask me.<br/><br/>After waiting for sales, running out of cash for unseen reasons, and messing with every laptop available; I finally decided upon Asus as the company. I was originally waiting for a 15 inch, year-old model that was a little bigger but packed an i7 and larger SS hard drive. The Zenbook was always in the back of my mind, but I thought I would need something bigger than a 13 inch screen. I got impatient, as it had been so long and Amazon took a while to restock the 15 inch Asus, so I just went ahead and purchased this.<br/><br/>I could not have been happier with my choice. A 13 inch laptop is more than big enough for me. I don't squint when reading (which I thought might be an issue), partly due to the awesome screen and it is very portable. I actually carry my laptop with me everyday now; something I have never done. I guess I will touch on each aspect quickly. Note: I am not even close to being tech-savy.<br/><br/>Size/material/weight: This is really a perfect sized laptop. The material is some sort of aluminum, maybe? But very scratch resistant and solid feeling, a huge plus for me. A plastic laptop at this price range was something I wasn't going to consider. It is super light and in the sun almost gets a purplish tint; very pretty.<br/><br/>Power: I have the i5 with 256 SSHD and it is more than enough more me. The computer boots up in a second and loads everything and completes all tasks quickly. The biggest software I run on this laptop would probably be Matlab and some chemistry data analysis software (all work well). I had my heart set on an i7, but after talking to some people who were actually computer-savy, it seemed that for a dual-core processor, there wasn't really going to be a noticeable difference between an i5 and an i7.<br/><br/>Battery: Perfect. I don't take my charger to lab anymore and just use it in "battery saver" mode with 50% screen brightness. It lasts about 8-9 hours that way. If you are actively running software or searching the web like mad, and watching movies; it will definitely be decreased. But, the charger is small and easy to tote.<br/><br/>Screen: The screen has a matte finish, and at first I had no idea what that mean. Basically, there is no glare. The colors are beautiful and the screen is very crisp; very HD-ish. I love it!<br/><br/>Negatives: The only con to this laptop would be the lack of a back-lit keypad. I am willing to bet Asus will add one to a model shortly down the road; maybe they already have!<br/><br/>Final Notes: You will not find a better laptop than this for the price. I will always buy Asus from now on and I can see myself coming back to this Zenbook should they keep making it. Lastly, pictures will not do this computer justice. I looked at the google images as well as the ones posted here. It just looks meh in the pics. Once it is in your hands you will see it is solid, and beautiful.
The ultrabook is almost perfect. I have the i5 version/gold version.<br/><br/>Looks: It looks very slim and the build quality looks superb. The metal body, though not one piece, makes the laptop look very premium. Covers are put together in a very precise and clean way. Looks almost unibody. There is no extra pieces on the keyboard section except for the nicely layout keyboard and large trackpad. The speakers are under the body and engineered into precisely cut matrix of small dots. The hedge connecting the screen and the body is also metal and has the same champaign/gold color as the outer body. It feels tight in a good way. The bezel around screen is normal, not as thin as the XPS has, but it absolutely does not look thick. One more thin, the surface of the laptop does not have that Zenbook circle look, just a nice one-piece metal with light gold color. I like it this way. (5.0/5.0)<br/><br/>Keyboard:  The keyboard is good enough for normal typing. The key travel is decent; it almost feels like a MacBook. The space between keys are good; you don't have the chance to press two keys together or mis-click any key. However, after using it for almost a month I do feel the necessity to have backlit; I guess ASUS need to consider it in the future series. Another downside for the keyboard is the key feels a little loose. That's why I said almost feels like MacBook. When you press the key you can feel the key shaking around a little, and for keys you have to press with your little finger (not as strong as your index or thumb), you feel it shakes more and harder to press. And the keys get oily very soon so you should clean it daily. (3.9/5.0)<br/><br/>UPDATE: after one month use, the Z key and left TAB key feels more flimsy. so I start worrying about the longevity of this keyboard.<br/><br/>Trackpad: one of the most important parameter for laptop/ultrabook. It's not a MacBook so don't expect MacBook trackpad experience. However, the trackpad is decent enough for $700-$1000 range laptop. It is very responsive; there is no cursor jumping around; the scrolling is smooth. With the ASUS gesture center, you have access to quite good multigesture: two finger for right click, three fingers to activate Cortana; four fingers to call out action center; of course zoom in/out/rotate. I haven't used it long enough so I can't say how long it will stay in this way. The cons about this trackpad of course, is despite it tracks smoothly, it is kind hard to precisely move your cursor to the point you want. This is due to the lack of good move acceleration mechanism. I guess ASUS didn't want that so it is easier to make the trackpad tracks well first. You have to move to some place near your destination and then move to your destination with a slower speed. Like playing golf. Another downside with the trackpad is it gets activated easily. Usually when you are typing your finger can accidently touches the trackpad and your cursor just jumps to somewhere you never expects. Best thing to do, connect a mouse and disable trackpad for long typing session. (3.8/5.0)<br/><br/>Ergonomics: The laptop overall provide good ergonomics. Good for use on desk, lap, bed, kitchen counter, Starbucks, airport. Quiet and cool. But there are few things that can get annoying sometime. First, the two plastic stands under the screen that are supposed to elevate the screen side a little and help provide a comfortable angle when you are using the laptop does not work well with the four big plastic feet under the bottom case. The height is not adjusted well so one of the big front foot is lifted in air when laptop fully opened. The result is your laptop will rotate around one front feet (in my case the right one) when you put a force on it. Really,really annoying when you are using the trackpad and always accidentally push the laptop forward. I have had a replacement from Amazon. The problem is worse that I can actually feel the tilt when the laptop is opened up. I returned the replacement. So I think this is a design or quality control issue for this UX305 line (not sure for UX303 etc). A second problem is the trackpad position/size. I haven't used trackpad before (had a thinkpad) so I am not sure if it's a problem with all ultrabook trackpad. But using this one I have to put my wrist in an angled position where my wrist is at the table and fingers lifted up to use the trackpad. In this way my wrist gets tired within one hour and hurts for longer duration. I guess it's because the laptop is too small. Provide extra space under the trackpad so you can rest your wrist on the same level of your fingers. Otherwise there is no complain about ergonomics for this laptop. (4.0/5.0)<br/><br/>To be updated.<br/><br/>Screen:<br/><br/>Performance:<br/><br/>Price:<br/><br/>Overall:
I spent WEEKS looking through pages and pages of various laptop brands meticulously observing the price point and pros and cons of everything. It wasn't until I discovered the ASUS Zenbook UX305FA that my interest was genuinely peaked.<br/><br/>So, after screaming "YES!" and "NO!" and punching myself in the face a few times, I pressed the order button and my shiny new Zenbook was on the way! Unfortunately the shipping process was a complete disaster with the laptop remaining in the "Preparing to Ship" phase for a few days although I selected one day shipping. After three days the laptop arrived at my apartment even though it was still in the same shipping phase. :-/ Whatever. I'm here to review this lovely laptop, not the horrendous shipping.<br/><br/>First off, the laptop is quite stunning to look at. It's dumb thin and very very light yet still feels very solid and sturdy. The screen is ridiculously sharp with text being ultra crisp and the colors are swell. The screen isn't super bright even with brightness turned all the way up and the speakers are far too quiet even when turned up.<br/><br/>Now, I must mention a few problems I encountered when upgrading the Zenbook from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 because I can't be the only one who encountered the two problems I'm about to discuss.<br/><br/>Problem #1<br/><br/>Right after setting up Windows 8.1 when first turning on the laptop, I was immediately given the option to do my free Windows 10 upgrade. So I did. After the upgrade, I noticed that the system retained all of the ASUS bloatware that came with the laptop. Whatever. But there was a problem. The Windows Store app wouldn't open. When I clicked on the icon, the app window would open for 2 seconds and then crash - every time. After 2 hours of fruitless Googling, I decided to clean install Windows 10 to fix the problem. This would also remove all the bloatware. Win! Fast forward some more and I'm cruising around my laptop with a functional Windows Store and no bloatware :-D<br/><br/>Problem #2<br/><br/>But then I looked at my keyboard, specifically at the F2/Airplane Mode key. A little LED light built into the key was shining bright which indicated that Airplane Mode was turned on. BUT GET THIS: IT WASN'T TURNED ON. The light had somehow become inverted after upgrading to Windows 10. Turning Airplane mode off would turn the light on and turning Airplane mode on would turn the light off. Backwards. Ladies and gentlemen, I spent two long days trying to fix this. I flashed the BIOS, I clean installed Windows 10 again, I uninstalled and reinstalled all the drivers, and I prayed to the Lord in Heaven - all to no avail. It was only after I checked out the UX305FA Windows 8.1 driver/software page on the ASUS website did I discover the solution!!! There is a lone driver in the Wireless section that deals specifically with this damned little light and IT FIXED IT!!! So, Zenbook owners, if your F2 light is on even though Airplane mode is turned off, you got a problem that needs some fixing.<br/><br/>I must sleep now.
Wonderful laptop if you take into consideration the type of demographic Asus is trying to attract. This laptop is wonderful for school and business, allowing you to efficiently draft documents, edit excel files and create powerpoints. It is not for video editing, gaming, or advanced photo editing. The laptop is consistently smooth, boots in under a minute, loads files quickly and never freezes.<br/><br/>Build: Precision machined brushed aluminum makes the laptop absolutely beautiful until to touch it. Fingerprints can be seen everywhere and this problem is known to Asus as they include a micro fiber cloth. The laptop feels sturdy and does not flex easily. The keyboard keys are extremely shallow compared to other ultrabook models however this never causes a problem while typing. Typing is smooth and was an easy transition.<br/><br/>Speakers: Worst speakers I have ever heard on any laptop. The quality is obviously extremely high except the sound volume is painfully low. I would recommend listening with a good pair or earphones instead of using the speakers.<br/><br/>Touchpad: Touch pad is extremely responsive and smooth however, both the right and left click tab are extremely loud. At first I thought this would not bother me but after a while it started to get on my nerves. This may not bother you and it may just be pet peeve however it is worth mentioning.<br/><br/>Besides what I have stated above this is a solid laptop that is perfect for average work and multi-media use. I would highly recommend and do not regret my decision at all. A great and cheaper alternative to the new Macbook.
I was looking for a new laptop before I went off to college and read an article stating that this was the "best student laptop" around, so I decided to give it a shot. Terrible choice...<br/>...first off, it's slower than my old laptop (an HP Pavilion which has almost no processing power...that just makes no sense).<br/>Secondly, the track pad is AWFUL. It barely responds to your movements and makes the loudest, most irritating clicking noise you could imagine. Very distracting.<br/>Also, the speakers sounded as if they were broken. Not only that, their sound was just terrible to begin with. I had to bump them up to 100 just to hear ANYTHING. Crackly sound, bumps galore...just terrible.<br/>Then there was all of the crapware that was installed on it when I got it. Just unnecessary junk that fills your hard drive and slows the computer down.<br/>Anyways, I returned it, got a full refund, and invested about $150 more for an HP Spectre which is 100x better in every sense. Great speakers, great track pad, incredibly fast, absolutely NO crapware. Highly recommended.
PROS: Very fast! I play CS:GO and I have a very nice gaming PC, so I notice when something isn't fast. This laptop definitely is no slouch. It handles CS:GO on low with 60ish fps which is playable. It handles my 20+ tabs and multiple office programs very well. Never skips or stutters.<br/><br/>The battery is pretty incredible, to be honest. 10+ hours on every battery so far.<br/><br/>The screen is stunning. It gets very bright and it's extremely crisp!<br/><br/>The style is great. Very sleek and good looking.<br/><br/>CONS: The keyboard. Everyone says that this is a really good laptop keyboard, but if I'm honest, this thing is terrible. It doesn't register half of my key presses and I have to mash every key to get it to work. I don't know if this is just mine, or if it's all of them, but it sucks.<br/><br/>It gets really really really hot if you're using it very heavily. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, it's hot.<br/><br/>The lid isn't very tight. Probably just a problem with mine, but the screen is very loose. It'll fall sometimes without me wanting it to.<br/><br/>OVERALL: Would I buy this again? 100%. The value is very good for what you get, even with the terrible keyboard. All of the pros outweigh the one con. People say the WiFi on this thing isn't the best, but I've had zero problems so far. Works just fine. Even on campus with routers not very close at all times.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this laptop!<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/>I've had this product for a while now. Still using it daily. However, after using it so much, I've realized that the WiFi card is terrible for gaming. It ping spikes like crazy. For every 5 minutes of playing you're probably standing still for a minute of that time because you can't move from lagging so badly.<br/><br/>Also, I'm having track pad issues as well. It moves around but it doesn't click sometimes. So I have to navigate with the keyboard sometimes, but after a while the track pad comes back to life and it's usable.
This is a great little machine and would have received 5 stars from me were it not for the weak hinge. After 3 weeks of use the hinge on my unit would no longer hold the screen up at any less than a ~60 degree angle...still useable, but I'd have exchanged it were I not already so dependent on this lightweight, capable little beauty. I really do love it, and I don't think there's another 13" ultrabook out there with these specs in this price range. Just be careful with the hinge or you'll have to remove the bottom of the case to clamp the metal hinges back down.<br/>The only other gripe I have is the location of the power button - I've hit it before and worrying about it while typing can be slightly distracting.<br/>With that said, I probably use this more than most people would a machine of this size - for several hours a day in several locations.<br/><br/>Likes: Battery life, quality FHD *non*touch-screen (less battery drain and who uses metro anyway), 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD, sturdy, flex-free chassis & kb, trackpad experience, silence and, most importantly, it retains usability while remaining sleek and quite light.<br/><br/>Dislikes: hinge, power button location, have had some issues with Firefox freezing and closing that may be due to the new M series processor.
It's a great deal for a solid laptop. I was super impressed by how lightweight it is. Battery life ~5-6 hours is good enough too. After 2 weeks, major issues thus far are 1) display driver crashing once a day, causing screen to momentarily go black. 2) mousepad with a mind of its own. Every so often, my browser will automatically magnify to 250% or shrink upon a slight touch. 3) screen auto-dimming suddenly even after switching off Enable Adaptive Brightness under advanced power plan. It happens when I switch between applications (i.e. Spotify to Browser).<br/><br/>The mousepad problem can be fixed with a $20 workhorse wireless mouse I have from LG. For the first problem, I just installed a generic graphic display driver from Intel's website per a previous customer's comments (delete the existing driver first). We'll see how this goes. The screen auto dimming problem only happens once or twice a day, only with switching from Spotify to browser, so it may be an isolated issue.<br/><br/>These 3 issues are all more annoyances than deal-breakers, as they minimally affect what I need the computer to do. 2 seem fixable, so overall I'm still happy with this guy!
I love this laptop.  Stylish.  Beautiful screen.  Nice chiclet-style keyboard.  Blazingly fast. Absolutely zero complaints.  Love everything about it!  Full disclosure:  I buy everything from Amazon.com, but for this purchase I bought it from the Microsoft store for $100 less due to a "student grad" discount.  MS also bundled the software "bloat free," however that didn't matter to me.  When I unpacked the PC, I never booted it to Windows.  Before I turned it on, I stuck a USB stick in with Ubuntu 14.04 on it, reformatted the hard drive and laid Ubuntu down as the o/s.  This PC makes child's play of Ubuntu... zero issues... and crazy fast.  I am not a gamer, so I can't speak to performance in that regard.  I am also a wireless mouse user, so the fact that others have found the track pad to be an annoyance is something I cannot speak to.  What I can say is this:  I would recommend this machine without reservations.<br/><br/>Wanted to add these additional comments:<br/>1) My review is based on three weeks of rigorous use.<br/>2) I have had zero issues with the display driver... no crashes... I wonder if the issue is with Windows?  I am running Ubuntu 14.04.
Apple sucks.<br/><br/>There, I said it. While I love my iphone and LOVE my ipad, those aren't incredibly overpriced compared to competitors and are unique in their own right. NOW when it comes to laptops, I had a deep internal struggle, primarily because every other "on-the-go, retro glasses-wearing" professional loves their Mac air. My frustration is not ONE apple employee could ever truly justify the price to me. "They last twice as long", "you'll never get a virus", etc - everyone knows how outdated these claims are.<br/><br/>Enough apple hating, I looked to this guy as my work and travel journalism machine and its INCREDIBLE. SSD makes it pin drop quiet, extremely quick boot up, i5 is lightning fast, the matte screen is solid, and it has a nice, wide keyboard for on the go typing. One downside is the tiny speaker (its a laptop) and the plastic bottom supports slide easily on tables (easy home project). Did I mention the battery life is 8-9 hours? Oh and It's sold for 600-700.<br/><br/>If you're looking at a Mac Air, just buy this instead and take the extra 300-400 and buy yourself a new suit. boom.
There are some mixed opinions on this laptop, and I understand why.  However, it still does everything I need in a slim package.<br/><br/>BUILD<br/><br/>The design of this laptop is very similar to Apple laptops, which is to say bland.  It looks like many other laptops, with a dull grey finish.  With that said, the chassis is sturdy and I've been happy with how it has held up.  I have already accidentally stress tested it some and it survived with no issues.<br/><br/>In terms of weight, this is pretty typical ultrabook range, meaning a lot heavier than a tablet, but not a big deal to carry around.  I was hoping for something a little lighter.  The strange hand position in the pictures is because I am trying to avoid it slipping out of my hands.  It is a slippery beast for sure.<br/><br/>Charging is unfortunately done with a proprietary connector.<br/><br/>SCREEN<br/><br/>At 13", this is my favorite laptop size.  It isn't so bulky that I regret bringing it, but not so small that I am squinting.  Speaking of that, the laptop was set to scale all text larger.  Perhaps some people were complaining that it was hard to read.  However, that makes everything in menus and assorted other areas look blurrier.  Forcing a Windows update helped, and I also see that someone has posted a fix online.  The most complete fix is simply to turn scaling back to 100% in display settings.<br/><br/>IPS screens are great in any device, but particularly important in mobile devices.  As we turn the screen, other display types tend to fade out or look strange.  Surprisingly, that does happen a bit on this IPS display, but not too bad at all.  Once the scaling issue is fixed, it is crisp and text is pleasant to read.  Colors are not bad, and motion blur is likewise not ideal.  In short, getting a 1080p IPS screen at this price is impressive, but requires some compromises.<br/><br/>PERFORMANCE<br/><br/>The combination of a fast SSD and i5 processor make this laptop a dream to use, with no stutters at all in most normal tasks.  Applications open quickly, and the computer boots as fast as I could hope for.  Internet speed is also surprisingly good, and the fast disk and memory make downloads and streaming much like a nice desktop.<br/><br/>INTERFACE<br/><br/>The chiclet style keyboard has a good amount of travel and is not cramped.  I wouldn't mind typing extensively on it if I needed to stray from my desktop keyboard for work.  The trackpad is a bit too "sticky," meaning there is too much traction as my finger slides.  Multi-touch gestures like scrolling work well and reliably.<br/><br/>SUMMARY<br/><br/>While the UX305LA makes some compromises compared to more expensive ultrabooks, it is still a fast and functional laptop that will probably make you very happy.
I have had this laptop for about a week, and I would like to make other buyers aware of a few facts that are not initially specified.<br/><br/>The Good<br/><br/>-First off, the laptop does not have just 802.11a/g/n wireless, it is a full Dual-band wireless AC wireless card.  This is based off what the system is telling and showing me.  The wireless send speeds jump up around 320 kbps.<br/><br/>-The SSD it comes with is quite quick as well, and has around 203 GB free, which is plenty of room for the average user.<br/><br/>-Running multiple videos at 1080p is a breeze, the system comes with 8 GB of RAM and I have yet to see it go above 5 GB's in use.<br/><br/>-Having never used 3.0 ports before much, I was happy to see that my 2.0 format equipment worked flawlessly with the system.<br/><br/>-The core M's .8ghz rating can be a bit of a sticker shock, but fear not as the system fluctuates in its speed, as demanded.  When idling or when doing basic typing or word processing, the core stays around .79 ghz to reduce battery life. When under higher demands, the core will ramp up past 1 ghz<br/><br/>-The screen is Full HD, not just 1366/768.  I can appreciate that the screen has a no-glare, matte finish.  My external monitor has a glossy finish and reflects sunlight straight into my eyes, while this laptop's screen does not.  Also, you might want to calibrate the screen out of the box and increase the font size, as it can strain the eyes a little bit to read text, and the gamma is a bit off out of the box.<br/><br/>-I really appreciate the fact that there is no fan. There is absolutely no noise whatsoever coming from the machine.  However this does create a bit of a problem, refer below for more information on this.<br/><br/>-The keyboard is solid, and has a satisfying feeling when typing.<br/><br/>The Neutral<br/><br/>-The laptop is not black in any way, shape, or firm.  The lid is a nice dark grey/brown, but the inside is a metallic purple/grey.  I like to think of it as more of a luxury brown.  I wish it was full on black, but I am quite alright with a nice brown.<br/><br/>The Bad<br/><br/>The USB ports are quite tight, and small.  The body of the laptop is barely thick enough to include USB ports, and it does not really surprise me that they are so tight and small.  The USB on the front left is the tightest, and takes some effort to insert drives and other applications.<br/><br/>-The lid does collect fingerprints pretty easily, not too badly though.  However, the bottom is another story, and gets smudged up quite quickly.  But I don't mind, as how much will you be looking at the bottom of the laptop?  Almost never..<br/><br/>-The MAJOR point I would like to talk about quickly, is the system's tendency to become quite hot.  On the day I received it and set it up, it heated up to the point were it was uncomfortable to handle.  Keep in mind the core can handle high temperatures, but may hurt the system in the process and yourself. I will be running an external monitor from this computer and am concerned about the heat, so I have purchased a cooling pad to stick under this. Hopefully, it can take the heat down a notch.<br/>  i. The palm rest, touch pad, keyboard, and sides all stay cold and  comfortable.  However, the top of the keyboard, directly underneath the ASUS logo, becomes quite hot.  It is almost unbearable.  This is only occurring under high loads such as games and playing multiple, high res videos.  It is otherwise quite easy to carry around, and place on the lap to type and to browse the web.<br/>  ii.  There is also a heat vent hidden directly underneath where the laptop hinge is.  It spans the full width of the laptop and seems to do a decent job at dissipating heat.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/>While this laptop does have several drawbacks, mainly the heat problem, it is an excellent buy.  It includes the latest hardware(Core M, SSD, AC Wireless, 3.0 ports, etc) and includes it in a well-built chassis that is full metal.  The form factor is less than that of a macbook air, while its hardware is on par with it.<br/><br/>In short, go ahead and buy it.<br/><br/>I will drop by again in a few months time if anything occurs or if I notice anything people should know about.
This is without a doubt the best computer of any kind I've owned.  The Solid State Drive  (SSD) is large enough for my needs (256 Gb).  If I need more memory for things like pictures,  I can buy an additional 32 Gb SD drive for $15-16.  Boot up is fast as my Android tablet--which is quick.  I love the lack of a fan and the ability to work in peaceful quietness.  I was not able to get the $699 on Amazon but Asus will sell you one directly--which is what I did.  It has 3 USB ports versus only 2 on the Acer Ultrabook the Asus replaced.  Great buy!
Love, love, LOVE!  I couldn't be happier with this laptop.  I really wanted to get the new MacBook, however I just couldn't rationalize spending close to $1500 for a laptop that I would use surf the internet and other basics.  This laptop was more than I expected and so happy I bought this instead of going the more expensive route.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/>- I'm a fan of Windows10. I did not like Windows 8 and felt it was so geared towards tablet use only. The new Windows has the best of both worlds.  Even though this laptop doesn't have a touch screen, the UI is still very user friendly and enjoyable to use.  One downside of Windows though (nothing to do with this laptop) the App store isn't the greatest.  Apple hands down is superior in that department.<br/>- The screen resolution on this is amazing.  So crisp and clear, great for watching videos<br/>- The laptop feels very sturdy.  It's an aluminum build, so it's a bit heavier that I thought it would be, but really it's not that heavy. It's very transportable and easy to take around the house or even in a bag.<br/>- The keyboard is easy to type on and I actually enjoy using this<br/>- The battery life is incredible.  I charge it every night, however on the weekends when I'm sitting on the couch watching TV and playing around on my laptop, it lasts me all day (and then some if I didn't have access to a plug).<br/>- The trackpad.  So this is on my good and bad list.  When I first got the laptop, the scrolling capabilities weren't there.  I needed to download  a upgrade to get it fixed, but once I did it worked perfect.<br/>- The laptop is so thin!  Exactly what I was looking for<br/>- Fast processor makes for fast page loading and no delay's while typing, opening apps, etc.<br/>- Great sound quality<br/><br/>The Improvement List (Won't even really call them negatives)<br/>- It's a bit hard to open the lid of the laptop.  I wish there was a little finger groove at the top of the screen.  Would help in that department<br/>- Again, the trackpad didn't work as designed.  Had to download an upgrade at Asus' website for the fix.<br/>- Wish there was a backlit keyboard (however this would kill the battery life a bit so I understand why they didn't include this)<br/>- The color could be a little bit more Gold (sometimes it looks Silver, but depends on the lighting)<br/>- Camera is so so, not the greatest quality but I don't really plan on using this much for photo taking<br/><br/>All in and all, I couldn't be happier with this purchase and I would highly recommend it for those that need a superb everyday laptop.
Edit: I'm revising this review from four stars to two stars and I'm returning this machine after using it for a couple of days. The heating issue is just too much of a problem to ignore. Running a browser and a word processor? It gets hot. Running Windows Updates in the background? It gets hot. Uncomfortably hot to the point where it's uncomfortable through clothes and impossible to place on a lap if you're wearing shorts.<br/><br/>Another issue I've noticed after using it for a couple of days is that the battery life indicator is all over the place. One moment it says there's ten hours of charge left and the next it goes down to three. I ended up timing a full charge with a stopwatch running it on the Balanced power option and it came out around 5-6 hours.<br/><br/>I'm leaving the rest of my review intact below for anyone who is still thinking of buying it, but the heat issue makes this machine a no go for me.<br/><br/>Original review below:<br/><br/>I bought this laptop and a MacBook Air in the same week to try them out and ultimately went with this machine over the Air. I use a lot of Asus products and I've found that they're either solid workhorses that go forever or they have a glaring production flaw that renders them useless pretty quick. So far I've been impressed with this one and there are no obvious flaws, though there are a few minor annoyances.<br/><br/>On to the good and the bad.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/>-The size and the weight is excellent if you're looking for portability and don't need a lot of computing power. I'm using it exclusively for document formatting and it's perfect for that.<br/>-The keyboard feels much nicer than the Macbook Air. There's some give to the keys which was absent on the Air making the whole typing experience awkward. There's none of that on the Asus and it feels good even at cruising speeds over 100WPM.<br/>-The screen is pretty good and gives you full 1080p.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/>-This is not a performance machine. I figured I'd put that under the good and the bad. If you're looking for an all-around machine that allows for more intensive programs like gaming, Photoshop, etc. you should look elsewhere.<br/>-No backlight on the keyboard. This is a wash for me. I know where all the keys are so it's more a minor annoyance than a deal-breaker for me, but if you hunt and peck then that could definitely be a drawback in dark environments.<br/>-Heat! When I first set up Windows the thing got hot up near the underside by the screen. This seems to be isolated to when you're doing something that's resource intensive, I don't have the problem when running a word processor for example, but see above about this not being a performance machine. "Resource intensive" can be defined as setting up Windows or installing a program. It's not terribly uncomfortable, but it is an annoying design tradeoff to get rid of the fan.<br/>-The screen has a weird texture to it. I checked my computer and a display model and that just seems to be a thing and it's difficult to explain. It's really only noticeable on a white backdrop and appears to be a thing with this model, but the odd texturing can be distracting when you notice it.<br/>-The SD card slot doesn't fit an SD card entirely. Part of the card is always going to be sticking out. Seems like a size limitation issue, but it also makes it difficult to put a card in and forget about it which is possible with larger machines.<br/><br/>I read some other negative reviews of this before purchasing to see if there were any glaring issues and figured I'd address problems from other reviews here:<br/>-I picked up a mini-HDMI to HDMI cable along with my purchase and have no issue. I connected it to a 1440p monitor (little bigger than standard 1080p) and there weren't any major issues.<br/>-Some people took issue with the way the trackpad works. I've had no trouble with it. Touch gestures work fine, I don't bump it with my wrists like on other Republic of Gamer Asus laptops I've owned, and it's serviceable. There's also an option to turn it off and use an external mouse which is nice.<br/><br/>Overall this is a nice machine for the money. If you're a PC person who likes the form factor of the Macbook Air I'd say this is a reasonable and far cheaper alternative. Just keep in mind that you're not going to be running anything intense like Photoshop, gaming, etc. on this bad boy.
I finally realized how unproductive tablets are when working with a virtual keyboard and hobbled mobile programs.  I also had a slowing desktop and I had to make a decision between spending around $700-800 on new hardware (processor, mainboard, memory, and graphics card), or perhaps a decent laptop.  I reviewed more expensive models, chrome books, Macbooks, and other brands that might fit the bill instead.  I was tethered to a desktop configuration because I played video games, but no longer.<br/><br/>I then happened upon this beauty of a laptop with an advanced chipset, a high definition screen, fanless, thin, aluminum construction, light with a long battery life.  I wanted something I could carry with me, one that accepted my photo editing software, and I could watch my videos that requires Flash.  More importantly I wanted something that wasn’t going to break my bank account.<br/><br/>The new 14 nm fabrication is truly a marvel of engineering and what it allows to be put in this thin and sleek design.  There are no moving mechanical parts since it is a fanless system and utilizes a solid state drive.  The unibody aluminum makes it feel like a Macbook-an imitation perhaps.  It's not the theft of Apple ideas, but Apple inspired.  If they charged less for their products, they would certainly be a consideration.<br/><br/>Aside from the everyday office productivity, I’ve been able to use it to edit RAW photo files in Lightroom and Photoshop with hardly any perceptible loss in speed.  My desktop is from the 45 nm era with a Wolfdale 3.16 ghz dual core,  4 gigabytes of ram, a 6850 Radeon video card, and 7500 rpm hard drives on Windows 7.  It is slower than the Asus Zen UX305 in most respects when editing photos.  The HD screen is adequate for general photo editing and for more stringent requirements, I can attach it to my 24” monitor with a micro HDMI to VGA adapter.<br/>It is the perfect unit for someone who requires moderate power, a really great price, and is dependent on Windows to run specific programs.<br/><br/>My only less stellar observations are these:<br/><br/>The track pad is rather temperamental (I use a mouse which is still superior)<br/>The battery life is not 10 hours but more like 7-8<br/>The keyboard is a laptop keyboard without a doubt<br/>The screen’s contrast ratio is not what it could be but with some tweaking, it looks quite good<br/>The bottom gets a little warm when engaged in work, but since the case is aluminum, it’s one big heatsink.<br/>The case shows fingerprints easily<br/>Windows 8.1, but I installed a classic shell program and it’s like working on Windows 7.<br/>The speakers are underpowered<br/>You need the ethernet dongle to connect to a wired network<br/><br/>Students and the average person will just love this gem of a laptop.  At $768.00 after taxes, it’s a steal and I can forget about the minor issues.  There's nothing cheap or budget about this unit.  I’m keeping it!
I got this laptop two weeks ago, so far, everything is working great! I only use the laptop a couple hours each day when I am at home to do homework, so far, I have only charged it 3 times. I am still not sure if the battery really last 12 hours. I tried google chrome-cast, and the laptop fan started running (like what always happens on my older laptop, so it's no big deal). Even when the fan starts up, it's still really quiet. It starts up and runs everything extremely fast (so fast that I feel spoiled). It is also extremely light-weighted, I can easily take it everywhere with one hand. The screen resolution is nice and crisp, no weird mustard-yellow color (I read about Asus having problems with some of its laptops). I saw some reviews about this laptop having wi-fi issues, I haven't encountered any problems. My last laptop, I kept getting disconnected, but this zenbook hasn't disconnected me at all.<br/><br/>The only small complaints I have:<br/>1) Keyboard: you have to press hard (harder than my old laptop) for it to sense it, maybe I just need to get used to it.<br/>2) The power charging cord is really short<br/>3) The battery status on the screen would tell me different battery time remaining sometimes, even if it's only a couple seconds from the last time I checked (not sure if it's estimating based on my workload or not)<br/><br/>Overall: I really recommend this laptop. For the price, it's a steal! Plus the color is really pretty. It says gold, but it's leaning towards rose gold. I am a girl, so no complaints there.
I've included a review of ASUS's tech support, as when you buy a laptop, you also buy it's warranty and the support you'll receive if and when any issue will happen. Unfortunately, with this model - issues pop up often:<br/>I've bought this laptop 6 months ago. At first I was divided about the pc's quality - lackluster performance, even worse than cheaper laptops bought 4 years ago, but the good battery life and the weight somewhat made up for that. A month ago, the laptop stopped working - it just didn't boot. Then the nightmare began - I called customer service, and after a while someone picked up only to ask for my contact information, saying that I will be called back shortly after. Of course no one called back, and I had to call again. This time I got support, and was asked to open a tech support ticket myself (!!) on the ASUS website, and so I did. The laptop was picked up by their delivery service 2 days later IIRC, much worse than the competition. After more than a week, the computer was returned, complete with a description of the fix applied:<br/>1. the firmware was updated<br/>2. the computer was formatted<br/>Now the question is: why was 2 even necessary, when the problem was with the firmware? The computer didn't even start, how can any user installed software/OS be the problem? So again I had to waste my time and reinstall everything.<br/>Fast forward to today, a month after having the laptop fixed by ASUS. The exact same issue happened again, and again - the customer service is barely lifting a finger to help. Again, I didn't get to an actual representative on the first call. This time, instead of waiting, I just called again straight after. To my surprise, I got a representative! But, again, ASUS can't do anything right, and the call dropped. I called again and got a nice representative, who tried to help. But he too wasn't without his faults - when I told him I'd like to receive my money back or a new laptop that won't break down every few months, he responded that a new laptop isn't necessary because "firmware problems are software problems, so the hardware doesn't need to be replaced", or something along those lines. The problem is, he forgot that the firmware is an integral part of the computer model. If this is caused by firmware, it should happen to any UX305FA, and that is exactly why I don't want this model. When I asked to talk to his boss, he told me that the boss will call me in 48 hours. It's nice to know that not only does ASUS produce laptops that don't work, their support services bosses don't too.<br/>Conclusion - if you want to spend your money on a slow laptop that will stop working every few months, and receive bad and slow support, this is the laptop for you. If you're looking for a computer for your employees, it will surely do wonders for their productivity, just as it has done for me. As for me, I won't buy anything by ASUS again, and hopefully will get rid of this laptop soon.
I'm not a heavy gaming user, so the i5 processor was a step up over my old i3, and not as expensive as the i7. 256 GB is perfect for me, since I keep most of my stuff (books, music, movies, etc) in the cloud. SSD means it's super thin and doesn't need a fan.<br/><br/>But gold? It does look more silver to me, if that matters.<br/><br/>Oh! Just as an FYI, once I put in my USB mouse, I didn't want the touchpad to be active anymore. The FN+F9 option didn't work at all. I checked the Asus website, and didn't find anything there about disabling the touchpad (except the fn+f9). However, other users talked about turning it off through the "Smart Gestures" software that Asus uses to manage their touchpad. My computer didn't have this software and I was having trouble downloading it from the Asus website. (I am a fan of Asus computers, but I have to say their website sucks if you're looking for support.) When my computer did a second round of Windows Updates, the software was now available on the task bar. I went into the options and checked the box that says "turn off the touchpad when a mouse is connected" and it works perfectly :)
Four Stars<br/><br/>The Zenbook is the perfect size and I love the color.  The keyboard has a comfortable feel to it, and performance is great overall.  It comes with Windows 10, but many outside applications do not seem to be compatible yet.  I use Google Chrome normally, but it runs slowly on the Zenbook.  The new “Edge” browser works well enough, I am just not used to it. The only problems I have had with the Zenbook is that two-finger scrolling is either super sensitive, or doesn’t work at all. Also, something that has only happened once so far, is that I lost connection to the wifi in my home and the Zenbook could not reconnect until I restarted it.<br/><br/>The matte viewscreen is absolutely a relief from glare and a welcome upgrade.  It's thin enough to be portable and not give me any muscle strain from carrying it around, and the charger is small and not clunky.  Another pro is that it's extremely quiet - no whirring noises.  You can definitely turn down the brightness and use this while your spouse is sleeping and not have to worry about waking them up.<br/><br/>Over all I'd say it hits a good value for the pricepoint.
ok，i am from china.for saving $100，i choose amazon us.i would just state its disadvantages here.<br/>1.touchpad is sticky because of its smooth surface design，which make fingers painful to use.i prefer my old lenovo's dotted one<br/><br/>2,the speakers is worse than a pair of small speakers which worth 5$.As i suffer from ear problems，i am thinking about a purchase of cheap speakers instead of using earphone.<br/>in contras，my lg g4's musical playing performance seems perfect，haha.<br/><br/>3.GPU is good.But you know，you cannot get a little horse pull a heavy car.CPU doesnt match the gpu，and my imagination.i cannot even play CSOL ( '▽` )But its power is enough for daily use.Before buying，i have fully understood this weakness，having mental preparation（given  its price）.And i hope you so.<br/><br/>4.warrAnty  only 1year .<br/>while on microsoft.com us ,the same price, 3years<br/>.and in china  2years with  free led screen replacement in case of bright dots.<br/><br/>above all，i cherish this purchase experience and the laptop，which will accompany my next 4years college life.<br/><br/>thank you  for reading .Panda Wu
a great alternative for the pricey macbook that is quite overrated now. what makes this special is its specs.. this laptop can compete with high end CPU's! great for gaming and office work.
I choose this brand and model after seeing some good reviews.  It worked fine for about a month, then starting acting up to a point where it became totally unusable.  The keyboard would not type correctly and mouse issues.  Looking on Facebook, others have experienced the same problems.  ASUS customer service first told me that it was a Windows problem, but that made no sense as an external keyboard worked, just the keyboard in the PC would not.  I finally got them to admit the issue was with the PC itself and due to the newness, was assured that if I sent it in, they would make a note in my file to expedite the repair and likely turn it around in one day.  I sent it in and now there is no note in my file, they have had it for four working days and no idea when the repair will be finished, but told me likely 5-7 working days.  Bad enough that the quality stinks, but their customer service apparently straight out lied to me about expediting service. Terrible!
I've looked long and hard for a lightweight powerful laptop that I could afford.  This is it.  I wasn't familiar with the M-Core processor but a little research indicated that seems to be close to the same power class as the Core i5, and that has proven to be true in my experience.  I run professional recording software on this machine (though I don't do any complicated work).  It also works with my Hauppauge USB TV tuner and it actually works in that regard than my 5.5 pound Core i-3 laptop.  It runs exceptionally cool, as well. 2.5 pounds, Supposedly up to 10 hours of battery power, but I haven't tested that capacity. The 256 Gb SSD, very quick, and if I run short of storage, I just go to my USB -3 external drive, or to Dropbox.  3 USB-3 connections.  It also has an HDMI out, but I have not yet tried that.  I love the anodized aluminum case, but I do have to say it is very prone to fingerprinting.  For what I do, it is a great machine.
This is a good computer, but a few details keep it from being great.<br/><br/>1. Fit, finishes and materials are all nice, and I like the color (I am male and work in an office FWIW, I think I don't look bad carrying this computer). It is dead silent and light. It feels fast and responsive compared to a late 2013 Macbook Air doing office and the web. I also like the compact AC adapter and the fact that they included a wired network adapter.<br/><br/>2. Asus' graphic design is awful. Its horrible logos and the bad typography they use on the keyboard spoil an otherwise beautiful design.<br/><br/>3. It comes with little adware (and I didn't buy the Microsoft store version). On the software front, it's worse offenders are actually Asus' utilities that nag you constantly to click a button to update something or to agree on something. I uninstalled most of them.<br/><br/>4. The touchpad is not nearly as loud as I was expecting, but mutitouch gestures are unreliable and the second clic area is just nonsensical. My 150 dollar chormebook has a much more responsive and usable touchpad.<br/><br/>5. The keyboard is not backlit. I would have paid for this feature but I knew what I was buying. UPDATE: after a few days I can say the keyboard is very nice to type on.<br/><br/>6. The screen has notorious backlight bleeding, although it's noticeable only when the screen is very dark (for example, when the computer is booting up). This, together with the off calibration and the slight but noticeable flex in the lid, give you a clear idea of the price of this computer.<br/><br/>To sum up: it is a nice and competent computer, and good value for the money.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I get 6,5 hs of battery life at most, just doing chrome. That's pretty far from the promised 10 hs.<br/><br/>UPDATE 2: Somehow the computer now has around 8 - 9 hours of battery life, which is much nicer. Apparently it needed a couple of recharge cycles to calibrate correctly. I'm adding one star because of this and the fact that Asus support commented this review.
I bought this for my son after comparing it to numerous comparable devices.  Our big debate was whether to go with the i5 and a fan or the m5 and no fan.  My son prevailed, and we for the more powerful i5.  Battery life is not a problem:  it is over 8 hours.  It's super light and very portable.  The aluminum case is attactive and seems durable.  The SSD is amazingly fast.  This thing is up and running from a cold start in just a few seconds.  I will "never ever get back together" with a traditional hard drive after watching this in action!  The only downside is that the keyboard is not backlit.  Overall, we are very impressed with this Zenbook, and I feel that we got a great laptop at a very reasonable price.
I've had this product for 3 weeks now, and I LOVE IT SO MUCH! However, the only issue I'm getting is that the Intel display driver keeps crashing regardless if I update it to the newest version, or downgrade it to the previous driver version. I've noticed that if I watch a movie with the AC connector plugged in, there's no driver crashes. However, when I watch a movie in full screen using the laptop battery that's not plugged in, I get frequent driver issues. This isn't too big of an issue for me as I mainly use this ultrabook for school related things (excel, word, reading PDFs etc.). I hope ASUS reaches out, as I did go on their website for this specific model to try to fix the driver problem with no luck so far.
Folks, there is a much better and less expensive version of this laptop that is optimized for Windows 8.1 without any of the third-party junkware or bloatware installed, the UX305FA-USM1.  The USM1 is the "Signature Edition" version of this laptop optimized by Microsoft for maximum speed out of the box.  It is currently available direct from the Microsoft Store for only $597.64 after the 10% off educational discount and additional 5% off you get by texting MSHS to 29502.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, even this ASM1 version is decent (same hardware), but the USM1 version is much better if you want to run Windows with optimized settings without a bunch of fuss trying to get to a truly clean install.<br/><br/>-----------------<br/>***EDIT TO ADD (03/26/15)***: Looks like the 10% Educational discount has ended on that USM1 model. Sorry for those latecomers who missed it. Must be too popular of a model over there at the Microsoft Store. It is still available for the base MSRP of only $699.99 though, which is still a steal for what hardware you get with this ultrabook, and cheaper than most third-party sellers on Amazon are charging for the ASM1 model right now.
Fast shipping and delivery.<br/><br/>Pretty sure everyone know the good things, here are the bad/average things.<br/><br/>The key board is average.<br/>Speaker is actually not bad, but it is not great either.<br/>Touch pad have a loud click sound.<br/>No keyboard backlight.<br/>USB port is a little stiff, have to use some force to plug my usb in, but this will probably smooth out later.<br/><br/>With SSD and fanless design, man this thing is smooth and quite. 750 bucks, amazing deal.<br/>SD card port is a little loose.
I purchase my unit from Microsoft Store $100 off no bloat ware on sale.<br/><br/>I love this unit! I originally wanted the 303la but the hinge issue stuck in my mind so I did not purchase it..<br/>Best money I ever spent, It will eat up your time at play, currently it runs Windows 10, Gnome Ubuntu 15.04<br/>and yes Yosemite. In fact as I type I am on Yosemite.<br/>Buy it you will not regret it. ( caveat the touchpad  takes some tuning )
UPDATE 7/9/2014: After two weeks of use, I decided to return this computer. I never got used to the wonky touchpad, and using an auxiliary mouse only worked in an office environment. I also had problems with the internet not working sometimes. A little Googling revealed that the problem may have been a malfunction of the power-save function in which it was turning the wireless card off even though I was using the computer (the same power save function that was causing the screen to dim even though I was using the computer.) The only workaround for this problem that I found online sounded really complicated, so rather than fight with a brand new computer, I simply returned it.<br/>---------------------------<br/>I've had this computer about a week now, and mostly it meets my needs/expectations. It is light, compact and a fast processor, as advertised. However, there are a few things that are less than ideal, and I wanted to share them here in case it would be helpful to someone considering this machine.<br/><br/>1. It is no longer easy or convenient to transfer files and programs between Windows 7 and Windows 8.1, the way it was between Windows XP and Windows 7, say. In an attempt to force everyone into the cloud, Microsoft has eliminated Windows Easy Transfer capabilities in Windows 8.1. This means you basically have to start from scratch with this machine and download/transfer every single thing you want on it anew.<br/><br/>2. This unit does get warm. I know one of the top reviewers claims his Zenbook ran for hours and was still cool to the touch. Mine is not. The bottom of the computer is noticeably warm after a relatively short time (~20 mins.)<br/><br/>3. The touchpad is pretty frustrating to me. I can't tell if it's overly sensitive or not sensitive enough (or a combination of the two) but I've been trying to adjust to it for a week now and I still find it so frustrating that I am considering getting an auxiliary mouse for the first time in 8 years.<br/><br/>4. The power-saving dimming function seems to be entirely arbitrary. The screen often fails to brighten again when I start using the computer, which makes me feel like I am slowly going blind. Then suddenly, for no reason, it will brighten again and I'll be fine. Sometimes it dims itself again mid-use.<br/><br/>5. I think this is a common thing among all ultralight laptops, but I really miss the number pad. I use my laptop for both work and home use, and at work I used the number pad much more than I ever realized until it was taken away.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I would buy it again knowing what I know now, mostly because there were no comparable laptops with the kind of power and portability I was looking for.
I bought this for work. I run large excel files, power points and so on. It boots up in seconds, every time. SECONDS. No noise, no hum, the only slowness I experience is on from the internet not keeping up. Aesthetically pleasing, but the FN shortcuts are different then older models. Once I had the muscle memory to use them though, it is very convenient.
One of the best laptops that I've owned. Design is awesome - as thin as it gets. Weighs nothing and really great performance. (I just hope that Win10 is an improvement over the current dog that Microsoft is having us walk).  I would buy this laptop over and over again. I love using it - that's saying something for this crusty old MS Dos fan.
This review is based on the ASUS Zenbook UX305FA running Linux Mint 17.2 with the MATE desktop - NOT Windows.<br/><br/>Although the box that the Zenbook was shipped in probably could have held two Zenbooks, there was only a single sheet of brown paper about five feet long used as cushion. This provided so little protection, they might have just left it out. Despite this, my Zenbook managed to arrive in one piece. The first thing I did once I had the laptop plugged in and on my desk was to insert a USB 3 flash drive with Linux Mint and boot to it before Windows ever had a chance to come up. In less than ten minutes, I had Linux installed and running with no issues.<br/><br/>Specifics related to Linux / Linux Mint (I guess you can skip this if you're going to run Windows) - Suspend, power save features, volume control function keys, etc. are almost all recognized right after install. The only exception was the brightness controls, although brightness is still configurable elsewhere (power management specifically). The graphics were configured automatically and without issues and the system is running an open source video driver that seems to preform well. The system boots fully in less than fifteen seconds. I haven't timed it yet, but it's certainly plenty fast. Desktop feels very responsive. Between the SSD and 8GB of RAM, I seriously doubt that this machine wouldn't be able to run anything I need to do - most of what I do being general desktop stuff like web, email, music, movies, some sound editing and some graphics editing. I realize that most people will stick with Windows, I just thought I would relay my experiences with Linux.<br/><br/>Screen - Bright and crystal clear. I prefer the matte finish as it doesn't reflect the lights as badly as glossy screens. This will be especially helpful in the office where lights are hard to avoid. The resolution is a bit much for such a small screen, but adjusting the size of the fonts makes it readable without thick glasses and that resolution will be nice when watching videos and editing images.<br/><br/>Quiet - One of the top reasons I went with this model was the lack of any moving parts and the resulting lack of any noise. It's so very nice. I'm very fond of silence. It's also nice not to have to worry about dust eventually clogging up any fans.<br/><br/>Cooling - I have been operating the system for about three hours and it's lightly warm to the touch, but not nearly uncomfortable. I think that because Linux has so much less overhead than Windows, I'm not going to be pegging the processor on simple tasks so I won't have to worry about heat unless I'm doing some heavy duty stuff.<br/><br/>Sound - Meh. It's a small laptop - I didn't expect it to shake the windows. It's adequate from the speakers - but if I were in a coffee house or restaurant where there was an average level of noise, I would expect I'd be unable to hear it at all. Headphones sound great. No hiss even on high volume and no popping. For listening to music while I work, that'll do fine.<br/><br/>Wireless - I live in a very old brick house and wireless is always a little sketchy here. It's either the brick, loads of lead paint or multitude of other electronic devices I have interfering so I usually get average speeds. The Zenbook seems to be doing a little better than average. I moved around the house and never lost my connection, so I'm happy.<br/><br/>Keyboard - Feels firm, keys aren't mushy and they're pretty quiet when typing. I have always liked the flat style laptop keyboards - so much so that I get the same style on full 104 key keyboards for my desktops. I looked closely at the keys to see if the letters and symbols were "painted" on or were integrated into the plastic of the key but I couldn't tell. I always worry about the letters starting to wear off after time. I don't know what it is about how I use a keyboard, but sometimes this starts to happen in about a year of use and it frustrates me. If the letters are painted on, they did a good job. I don't know if they'll wear off eventually or not, but I'll be watching...<br/><br/>Battery - Not tested yet so I can't say one way or another.<br/><br/>Conclusion - I'm very happy with the machine. I would have loved to have had the option of the same system with a backlit keyboard, but I opted for this one despite the lack of a backlit keyboard because everything else was exactly what I wanted. I'm glad I bought it and I look forward to using it frequently.
I've been using an Acer C720 Chromebook for the last 19 months -- loved its light weight, almost instant boot up, SSD speed (albeit small size), day-long battery life.  Of course it wasn't Windows, but the cloud was allowing me to get much of my work done.  But... it was getting a little under-powered when working with large Google Docs, and of course the occasional *need* for a Windows powered app got me to look seriously at this unit.<br/><br/>Of course this ASUS Zenbook is more expensive, but the value for these features was more than I could pass up.  To see Windows boot up in seconds, to see a USB 3.0 portable HDD connect at about 4x the old HDD speeds, to see a WinPC laptop weigh about the same as the Chromebook... well, that is what I was waiting for.  It may be a little larger footprint, but it is pleasantly thinner.  It seems just the right size after using it 7 days.<br/><br/>I generally agree with previously reports of lightweight, advantages of the matte FHD screen (right resolution, no glare).  Keyboard was quite sufficient, maybe better than Chromebook.  Trackpad took some time to get used to, but now I can be comfortable with it... wish it was a little smaller, like the Chromebook, so it would be a little less finicky.<br/><br/>Battery life is not as good as the Chromebook... even with very light usage, the battery seemed only 2/3 the life of my Chromebook... maybe 7 hours of decent usage.  But I could live with that.  But I loved the fact that the Zenbook could load multiple Chrome tabs, some with large Google Docs, and not have to reload a tab when returning to it.  The Chromebook was getting weak in this regard for my heavy-lifting needs.<br/><br/>= = = = = = = Public WiFi - "limited connection" = = = = = =<br/>But I have hit a snag that is forcing me to consider returning this unit under the return period.  And I have seen this problem mentioned in a few other reviews.  The second day I had the unit, I went to the local bookstore/coffee shop (you know the one) to logon to their public wifi and could only get a connection with Windows message: "The connection is limited" ... i.e. NO INTERNET!  I have been to Microsoft's phone support and community forum and another tech forum to explore options to get this to function.  Although I have some success at some public wifi sources (major hardware chains, Ronald's hamburgers, etc.), I have exactly ZERO problems with my Chromebook on public wifi... period.<br/><br/>So if ASUS wants to respond to this posting, they will have to give me solid tips that will work, because I have tried many ideas to no avail.<br/><br/>==>> Has anyone else had this problem?  More importantly, has anyone had the problem and solved it yet?<br/>I will update this if further progress is made.<br/><br/> = = = = = =  Update June 17, 2015  = = = = = = = = = = = = =<br/>Although I continue to have problems at the bookstore public WiFi, I plugged in a TP-Link USB Wireless N adapter, loaded the driver and viola!... it connected to the bookstore wifi almost instantly.  So until Asus and/or Intel get a driver for this AC stock adapter that behaves better, I'll pack this small 3rd party adapter for public connectivity.  I'm upping my rating from 3 to 4 stars now.<br/><br/>= = = = = =  Update July 4, 2015  = = = = = = = = = = = =<br/>1) Clarification: the Wifi problem discussed above relates only to the newest Intel Dual Band AC 7265 adapter, not the N adapter that is in some units.  As of today, Intel is hoping the next driver update will solve the problems mentioned on their support forum... here's hoping.<br/><br/>2) An additional aspect of this unit not mentioned elsewhere AFAIK is that the video output of HDMI 1.4 is at a disadvantage to the DisplayPort output offered on Microsoft's own Surface units.  That is because the DisplayPort output, at least the newer one, offers a higher refresh rate (60 Hz not 30 Hz) and the possibility to daisy chain multiple monitors.  The refresh rate might cause some problems in mouse movement delay and smoothness in web page scrolling, especially if you hook up a UHD (or 4K) display.  The multiple monitors would be handy for desktop replacement purposes.  This was not a deal breaker for me as I will figure out how to deal with HDMI for now.
I have had this laptop for about a week now, so I can't give any information about the longevity.<br/><br/>My old laptop is a late 2006 Macbook.  I decided I did not want to get a Mac this time around for many reasons, but I won't go into those unless someone asks.  I am learning to program so I needed a computer that would just work- fast and portable without breaking the bank.  It is extremely light weight, fits in my purse and is very fast.  The boot up time is extremely short.  I like the fact that this computer came with a 256gb SSD at this price.  The amount of space is very reasonable for a portable computer.  I have never had an SSD before but this computer is extremely quiet and fast so I may be a fan now.<br/><br/>On the con side, this laptop does not have great speakers.  The volume is not very loud even on the highest setting and the sound doesn't sound amazing.  Honestly this might be more of a pro than a con because it keeps the price and weight down on the device.  Most of the time I will be using headphones on a laptop anyway.  I have desktop speakers for when I'm at home.  The track pad is another con.  It is very finicky and doesn't always register my finger movements correctly.  Sometimes I will scroll more than I want to or zoom in/out when I don't want to.  This can be improved by turning off some of the gestures that ASUS has enabled by default.  It prevents you from accidentally opening random things with your fingers.  This can be done via the taskbar (on the bottom next to where the time and date are located).  The trackpad is also very loud and clicky, but usually I just press on the trackpad rather than click the button and that works well enough.  You will want another mouse to use with this thing especially when you aren't out and about.  The biggest con on the device is that the battery is not easily accessible.  You can't just remove it like you can with other laptops which means you may not be able to keep this thing around forever.  It also does not have a touch screen which is actually sort of a big deal on Windows 8.  I installed classic shell though which makes the experience much better.<br/><br/>Overall it is an excellent laptop with a few minor annoyances but I really love it so far!
I got this specifically for networking field work, tech break/fix, etc. When I first opened it up I was in awe at how thin it was. It is basically, from a form factor and hardware perspective, a new (2015) MacBook Air that is not running OSX.<br/><br/>I initially ran into some issues with updates for Win8.1 and ended up waiting a LONG time to take action on the machine, avoiding any unnecessary shut downs that could cause corruption across the updates.  After about 13 hours, I was still getting a busy cursor, so I did a ctrl+alt+del and just logged off.  It didn't cause any issues, just needed to run updates again.<br/><br/>Display: 1920x1080, The screen is a non-glossy finish so glare is not an issue.<br/>Speed: Start up is around 10s from post.  not too shabby  Runs all the programs I need for work really well.<br/>Wifi: pretty quick...getting 866M/b consistently<br/>Eth: comes with a 1Gb Ethernet dongle<br/>Charge: I've had it unplugged for about 9-10 hours consistently watching youtube vids.  Pretty nice.<br/>HID (Trackpad/KB): The keyboard feels good.  The PC is so thin that I feel like I'm going to type through the machine. lol  The trackpad is pretty sensitive, but is ok with me.<br/>CPU activity: There is no CPU fan because of the CORE m features, and to be honest, it makes me anxious, but it doesn't seem to require too much ventilation.  There is no noise, and no performance degradation.  Impressive.<br/><br/>There is a lot of bloatware on the machine, but the ASUS Live Update, and Win BIOS Update are handy.<br/><br/>I've been running with this machine for about a month, and I have had no issues with it except for the initial updating problems.  I give this laptop 5/5 and will probably get a couple more for personal use.  That is a lot coming from a dedicated Mac user. :)
Overall good laptop.  I was debating this machine vs the UX303 (http://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Zenbook-UX303-13-3-Inch-Laptop/dp/B00S44HXRW/ref=pd_sim_147_6?ie=UTF8&refRID;=04YMSNA23YNRNTQN3WWS).  Biggest concern on the UX305 was the 'M' processor since it's meant to be for light duty use vs the powerful core i5, but after using it as normal, I see no issues with its speed to this point.<br/><br/>The biggest drawback on the UX303 is the computer is much thicker than the UX305.  The UX305 itself has a nice screen, good keyboard and semi-decent trackpad.  The trackpad sometimes doesn't respond on the two finger click or the scroll, but really Apple is the only one who got a trackpad right the first time.  The keyboard is responsive and the battery life is outstanding.<br/><br/>The machine itself is extremely thin less than a macbook pro and just about the same as a macbook air.  The lip of the screen doesn't really come out that much so it's a two handed opening which is not a big deal, but i'm not sure why the engineers didn't just adjust for that.  Oh well.  The other users are right on the backlit keys.  I guess once you get used to them you overlook how good that feature is and with this Zenbook, it does definitely get hard to see the keys at night.  The dark aluminum brush on the laptop doesn't help I'm sure.<br/><br/>Overall I gave it 4 stars.  The wifi card needs tweaking to get AC speeds, the trackpad is average at best, the bottom of the laptop gets hot when under load, and the keyboard is a little hard to see.  However as said above, the 'M' processor seems to hold up so far to everything I've thrown at it.
The ergonomics are great: nice size, weight. Plenty of USB connections. Speakers are quiet, I wouldn't be able to hear them if there was any background noise. For the most part I use headphones or earbuds and the sound quality is fine. Basic function of trackpad has been fine but I use a mouse most of the time.<br/><br/>The keyboard is better than expected...as nice as any laptop keyboard I've had. Some reviewers complain about the power button's location but it's been a non-issue for me.<br/><br/>The display is sharp and easy to read, but seems to go a bit greenish during video playback. I didn't want touchscreen and haven't missed it.<br/><br/>Great battery life. I'm off and on the computer throughout the day. The battery rarely dips below 50%. No complaints with the charging time.<br/><br/>The fan has come on only during a McAfee scan. Otherwise this PC has been silent. It gets slightly warm on the bottom during video playback, but only a little. Not hot, just warm. Top stays cool.<br/><br/>As other reviewers have noted, the video driver crashes. I see this about every other day.<br/><br/>In addition, in the past week, the computer has had two hard crashes, both times while browsing with IE. This is a bit concerning since there's no unusual software installed.<br/><br/>Not impressed with the McAfee LiveSafe, the Asus storage, or MS Edge. Windows 10 Home is usable, a good enough match for this hardware.<br/><br/>In summary, I would buy again. Hope they get the bugs in the video driver fixed, as well as the system crashes.
Pure awesomeness.<br/><br/>The laptop is very well made. It feels very sturdy, light and thin. Very close to a Macbook. The shell is made of aluminum.<br/><br/>The speed is amazing. There is hardly any lag. For example, when I click to go to the internet it loads very fast. The downloading time for anything is also very fast. At one point I had like 30 tabs open at the same time and all good. I compare this laptop to a smartphone's speed because as we all know smartphone are extremely fast beasts. The machine is a beast for the size and price.<br/><br/>One little annoyance was the brightness because it does not go up as high. The brightness only goes to highest when you are outdoors which is cool but I wanted to be able to have control of it. But now I do and you can to. Just click on the battery icon, then power and sleep settings, then additional power settings, then change plan settings, then change advance power settings, then scroll all the way down and click on display, then click on enable adaptive brightness and turn both off for battery and plugged in and click on ok to save and that's it. Now you should have control of all the brightness power you need anytime.<br/><br/>The colors on the screen are also a little washed out but this is not a big deal for me but it might be for other people. You can also use this laptop outdoors because of it's non-reflective screen and it works.<br/><br/>The reason why I bought this laptop is mostly for business. I will be mostly be using this laptop for Google Drive, email, internet browsing, youtube, and website building.<br/><br/>Also, remember you get 10 hours of battery life with this thing. Wow that's pretty good.<br/><br/>Update: I decided to buy the Elder Scrolls Skyrim game for PC using steam ad it works great but on medium high quality. I tried it on the highest quality and it was not a very pleasant experience. You can still play it on high quality but the game does not run smoothly because pictures are pausing like every half a second. I been playing for about 20 hours of Skyrim and the quality of the pictures are excellent, not pixel looking like you might think. It reminds me of Xbox 360 picture quality, that's pretty good. Excellent game by the way. It's true the laptop does get very hot but the game ran pretty smoothly.<br/><br/>This laptop only got hot when I was playing Skyrim but not with all the other stuff like watching youtube videos or internet browsing.
Ok, when I first received this product, the underside just showed model UX305F, and came with a USB/RJ45-ethernet adapter.  Panic mode!  However I went ahead and cabled-up the Ethernet-cable, checked the Device Manager to locate unidentified devices, and found an unidentified network adapter.  At the same time, I checked all the rest of the hardware specs to verify that this thing shipped to me really had all the correct cpu ID, cpu speed, memory size, SSD size, etc.  Everything checked except the absent wifi.  So, I visited ASUS website, accessed the support downloads for this device, and started updating everything.  After downloading the wifi driver, there it was, the correct wifi device.  After the drive installation, the wifi easily connected up with my home network, and performed up to speed.  (Whew!)  Next, I ran some video-editing benchmarks, just to make certain the 0.8GHz-2.0Ghz cpu performance was really there, and it was.  The video-clipping task executed within the expected 2.0 Ghz time.  Bottom-line, this model really is a very nice performer, particularly for the price.  One thing, if you are expecting a touch-screen, then you will be disappointed, but the touch-pad appears to support the latest Windows 8.x gestures just fine.<br/>I'm very pleased to this point, but I can see where somebody who is not as tech-savy could be pretty unhappy unless they quickly enlist some online support.
Exceptional laptop for the price. Very similar to the new MacBook but for half the price. The screen is awesome (wouldn't recommend more than 1080p for such a small display) and the colors are great. The SSD is fast and makes mechanical drive-based laptops feel awful to use. The processor is fine, power efficient, and can render 3D fairly decently compared to the last integrated graphics solution I had (you're not going to be playing games past World of Warcraft). The plumb-purplish color was sort of a setback at first, but I have grown to liking it. The keyboard is ok (what do you expect?) and the touch pad is alright. I'm not sure if it's software or hardware based, but sometimes it can be finicky. The aluminium is a little smudgy, but cleans off well. Overall, it's very competitively priced. I never thought weight and size would be a considerable factor in purchasing a laptop, but once you know, you can't go back. I highly recommend this laptop to anyone who is constantly on the go or on the web (battery life is ~5-6 hours web browsing). Also, I don't recommend buying laptops refurbished unless you have some experience installing drivers and diagnosing weird problems (Amazon has to wipe/reinstall Windows, and while it won't come with typical laptop bloatware, it loses some functionality out of the box that you can fix, of course).
My UX305FA came in the mail a week ago, and I've been in love ever since. I was just comparing it to the MacBook Air 13.3" and this baby pretty much kicks its butt especially for the price, and don't get me wrong I'm not an Apple hater one bit.<br/>Quick list of pro's and cons.<br/><br/>PROS: It's SOOO light and slim! design is beautiful. witch was really important to me<br/>  Battery life pretty bomb(as in good), can be on solid from 9-4 with no complaints.<br/>  Windows 10 looks and runs great on it.<br/>  It is fast. not insanely fast, but the perfect speed for the average Jo I'd say.<br/>  Probably more but I said I'd be quick<br/>  oh the smart gestures on the touch pad are sooo handy btw<br/>CONS: No backlit key board.(I say this because I really wanted one, but if you press fn+a the screen brightens up and is a good substitute. and I'm writing this in a dark room so its not bad)<br/>  Windows 10 was really easy to install, but was a bit jumbled for a bit afterword, I had to repair some program drivers and little things. It was worth it though.<br/>  honestly Idk if its my headphones or the computer... but they don't get along great for some reason and it makes me mad sometimes.<br/><br/>I think that's all. Overall I'm sooo happy with my buy. And I sure hope it lasts until I die. lol Hope this helped you out.
For $700 this is a great little Ultra-Book. Best of type I've used...though I've not really used any Apple laptops.<br/><br/>The display is bright and vivid, and the keyboard is much better than expected...and better than other laptop I've used. Very good feel and keys are positioned nicely. And so far I've managed to avoid hitting the power key (upper right hand corner)...possibly because there a little white led light giving it's position away.<br/><br/>The touch pad...on the other hand...is not so great. It's about on par with others I've used...but the buttons are a bit stiff (hard to press) and the pad itself is often too sensitive and thinks I've tapped it...when I haven't. But then I've had those same problems with other laptops. Still, it's good enough to use in a pinch. But for regular use I got a small Bluetooth Mouse for it instead.<br/><br/>Yes. The metal covering does smudge. But the color is a dark metallic charcoal color, and so except in the sun the smudges are hard to see...and easy to white off with a little alcohol (on a tissue)...or pre-soaked lens cleaning cloth.<br/><br/>But it has a really solid feel and is so light weight and thin. Really love it.
Pros:<br/>- SSD<br/>- Great Keyboard<br/>- Size<br/>- Weight<br/>- Screen<br/>- Ports<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Touchpad<br/>- Speakers<br/><br/>For college, buy a mouse and some headphones. You'll be set.
I recently purchased the Asus zenbook UX305LA.  This really is about the best laptop value I have ever seen.  What makes this laptop so great is that offers the best attributes that you want in a laptop without many sacrifices:  1) it is very fast with its i5 processor and 8G of ram, 2) it is very lightweight and portable, 3) it is well-built and does not feel cheap at all, 4) the speakers are great and loud, 5) it has very long battery life of near 10 hours, 6) the price is very reasonable with similar products costing $300 to $500 more (ie. Surface 3 pro, Mac book air, and Dell XPS).  The only thing you sacrifice with this laptop is that you can't play the top notch games on the market as it does not have a dedicated graphics card.  However, if you are a casual gamer, this laptop has plenty of ability to play games.  I downloaded GTA San Andreas from the app store and it runs beautifully.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this laptop as it has everything you need in a laptop at a great price without any real drawbacks.
This review is for the UX305LA 13.3 inch Titanium Gold laptop, the black one is a completely different model.  This model does contain a fan that is super quiet and hardly noticeable.  There is some bloatware but far less than any other stock computer I have encountered and was easily removed.  This computer is small, lightweight excellent for mobility.  It’s good for anything except gaming and mass storage due to having onboard Intel graphics, no dedicated video card and a 256 SSD.  If you don’t play hardcore games and don’t require a lot of storage space but don’t want an Apple this is the PC for you.  I have not seen a better price for the specs on this laptop.  This is a perfect computer for work or school.
I bought this laptop after becoming frustrated with my old Lenovo T420's weight, boot-up, and lack of battery life.<br/><br/>This Zenbook boots in seconds, weighs half of what the T420 did, and consistently stays alive for 10 hours as advertised between charges.<br/><br/>I was worried about the processor, but I haven't had a problem with it in any of my engineering-student related activities after about a month of owning this laptop.<br/><br/>I was also worried I wouldn't like the keyboard, but I like it as much as my T420's very different keyboard.<br/><br/>Great to find a 256GB SSD at this price.<br/><br/>Cons: terrible laptop speakers, pretty bad touch-pad with loud clicks. The one thing I really miss about my T420 are the separate mouse buttons below the touch-pad for left- and right-click. Both the speakers and touch pad are sacrifices I ultimately made for the thin design and low weight.
I am writing this review on this laptop as you read this. First off I need to start by saying that I was a Apple/Mac guy for years. I finally made the switch the PC/Android and this laptop was the perfect choice.<br/><br/>If you're looking to compare this to other laptops you may be considering for purchase this laptop is along the lines of a MacBook Air. You do give up 250gb of internal memory, but I'll take the 8gb RAM in return. This computer is just as light, if not lighter than the Air. It also has all of the ports you may need to function as an everyday computer user. I use mine for standard college student tasks, but it can run some solid programs if needed. As a person that isn't a computer genius, but needs to get plenty of work done this laptop is perfect! Did i mention it's roughly $300-$600 less than a comparable Mac?
When I saw the i5 model at 200 dollars off, I had to jump on the offer. It seemed like a great deal, and it most certainly was. I absolutely love the machine. Very attractive, many people even asked my if it was a mac, which shows how well this thing is built. It is also very fast, easily handling word documents and even some casual gaming like Hearthstone. There are some bad things about it thought. There is some issue with the display though, it seems to go black for a few seconds, then comes back and it says that the display driver shuts down, but was recovered. This often happens when I'm watching a video. If anyone knows a solution please reply to this, but besides that, it is a very capable machine for anyone who is doing some light video editing, and a college student would be very pleased with this machine as well.
I've only had this ultrabook for a day now so it's an early review. So far I must say I'm quite impressed. It's very sleek, lightweight and has enough ram and processing power for most everyday tasks. For the price it can't be beat.<br/><br/>The first thing I did was switch over to Linux. As a developer my use involves a lot of typing, excellent keyboard feel and quality are a must. So far it has not disappointed. I'm having difficulty not touching the large touchpad while typing. Made somewhat easier once I disabled it while typing.<br/><br/>The battery life seems decent, I haven't really tested it yet. I unplugged it at 100% and it was estimating around 7.5 hours. This was with heavy use at the moment and about 30% brightness.<br/><br/>I ran some rspec tests from a current project and it ran them at an admirable speed. As far as Linux compatibility it's a 9/10. I did have some issues not being able to change the brightness. I was able to fix this by creating a conf file for the Intel drivers and editing my grub file.Also a word of advice to users of Linux MInt. There seems to be an issue with the kernel currently in use by Mint in regards to suspend on this machine. After resuming the system becomes extremely slow, and and frame rates drop. Upgrading to kernel 3.13.0-51 solves this.<br/><br/>Overall a good buy, however there seems to be some background light bleed and it's rather noticeable in 1 spot. Luckily it's not very noticeable apart from booting up or when watching a very dark video.
A fantastic laptop for the price. I did some really heavy research after finding this laptop and found that this laptop was the best option for me. I really like the glare-less screen, all-day battery life (for me), keyboard, and the three USB ports. I made some videos to test out different games on the laptop to see how well they do.<br/><br/>Unboxing:<br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAC39fkmF0<br/><br/>Skyrim<br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBIghl2K1Lg<br/><br/>Cities: Skylines<br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4F8RdKsyHg<br/><br/>League of Legends<br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLxphN5tVgQ<br/><br/>Bonus Video (For people who say they suffer from a loose connector):<br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4StRaFI959E
My original review is below. I've had to modify it since the WiFi connection constantly fails. The Windows troubleshooter used to be able to fix it but now that doesn't work anymore. I've had to write this with a wired ethernet adapter. The ASUS support website is pretty worthless. I checked to see that I have the latest drivers etc. The web is full of people complaining about this and I wish that I had caught this before buying it.<br/><br/>Original review:<br/>Works as advertised. Light.Starts quickly. Good battery life. I just wish it didn't have Windows 8. An operating system 'look' that works for a phone or for people who just use a laptop for email, facebook and watching cat videos is not very good for doing actual work.
This is a phenomenal laptop for the price. I've had it for about a month and love it. Light, silent and fast enough for normal every day computing. Great battery life screen is sharp and easy on your eyes.  The keyboard and touch pad work well unlike my last Zenbook. With three USB 3.0 ports that seem to work fine with USB 2.0 devices and an HDMI port you have plenty of connectivity.<br/><br/>Windows 8 is well, Windows 8. Not as bad as I feared, just Windows 7 with a bunch of useless overlays that sticks stuff you actually use in places that are hard to find. Once you figure it out it's fine. Overall the operating system and drivers seem very stable.
Overall nice machine and excellent value. Starts up quickly, processor speed and memory is good enough for my needs. I'm horrified that Asus didn't coat the surface of the machine with something to prevent finger marks everywhere!?! I also had some very strange startup problems with my machine where it sometimes randomly couldn't find my desktop items - and also could not install the Simplified Chinese language pack. Although to be fair, that's very likely a Windows 8.1 issue. I also had my display driver fail a few times for a few seconds where my screen will just go black!
This is a great computer for everyday small business needs.  It is extremely thin and very lightweight.  Even with its portability, it has a very solid build and great typing performance.  It has also performed flawlessly with media I've used.  The only downside I see is the battery.  The battery life is exceptional for overall continual use, but unfortunately the battery drains even when the computer is in sleep mode.  In other words, you will have to recharge multiple times a week even with minor sporadic use.
This computer, for the current price, seems to be great. I was unable to connect to my home WI-FI router (Belkin Pre-N). I was able to connect through the Ethernet wire and my WI-FI hotspot on IPhone though. I called the tech support at ASUS. They tried a few things but the connectivity issue was not resolved. I must say that the wait time for the tech support was surprising short. Unfortunately, I had to return the computer as I did not want to take a chance on WI-FI connectivity when I am on the road.
Awesome product.  I upgraded from an I5 with a regular harddrive.  The zenbook brings Zen to my life with its super fast bootup.  It is seconds from power on to productivity.  It is lightweight and has great battery life.  When i pick up other laptops in the house, I feel like I am lifting weights.  This thing is superlight.<br/>Performance wise, it rocks.  10-15 windows open and it doesn't hesitate.  The only thing I had to get used to was windows 8 from 7.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.
I have had it for about 3 weeks. I am a college student and use this baby for 5+ hours a day and it has exceeded my expectations. Battery life is great, keyboard is comfortable, processor is sufficient, looks beautiful (people have complimented on how thin it is, comparing it to a Macbook air). There is nothing flashy about this computer, it's a solid computer that will get the day to day tasks done with no problems. I love it and would highly recommend it to anyone.
Not by any means a gaming rig, but a solid performer, runs Manga Studio 5 pro like a champ, great battery life, and no fans to go bad and fry your motherboard from the heat. The back warms up to a nice heating-pad temperature, but that's a plus to me; I'm cold natured and can use a little extra heat. It will play modded minecraft with optifine and 25 or so mods at 30-45 FPS. Gimp does'nt run so well but is adequate until I can get to my heavy lifter desktop PC.
If you want a detailed review, I can't do better than Anandtech:<br/>http://www.anandtech.com/show/9104/asus-zenbook-ux305-review<br/><br/>In short: When you see an ultrabook with 8Gb of RAM, 256 Gb SSD, for way less than 1000 usd for the first time in history, you have no choice but buying it. ultralight and portable, 8-10 hours of battery life, completely silent (no fan, and no HDD) and amazing performance. You can't get anything better for the price.
After using the UX305 for over a week now, I can say this thing is really nice. The core-m series is more than capable of doing full fledged computer stuff: excel, web browsing, media consumption. I've even played some Dota 2 on it. Only thing is that it's already developed a wear spot on the track pad. At first I thought it was skin oil, but I tried cleaning it with some isopropyl, but the spot is still there.
So far I love it.  The unit is light and easier to carry.  The screen is very easy to see and the matte type finish keeps the glare down to where I can sit in front of the living room window with no problem.  I have just started using it and have had no issues at all, everything is working just fine so far.  I will definitely revise my review if any issues come to light but so far it is awesome.
Read most of the reviews on here while I was waiting for this laptop.  I received mine last night and I love it.  Its everything I imagined it to be plus more.  If you are thinking about getting this model, do it!  The track-pad to me has no issues, as well as the keyboard.  The keyboard to me is identical to Mac laptops somewhat.  Only thing that this laptop is missing is the light under the keyboard so that you are able to see the letters at night.  But that is no big deal.  Its very fast and responsive.  I did not notice any screen flickering as some reviews mentioned. At least not yet, will update my review after few months of use if i notice any change.  -i5 model 256 SSD
The computer is fine.  Upgraded to Win10, no problem.  Only thing missing, that wouls have been nice, is a slot for a computer lock.<br/><br/>One nit to pick - Asus rejected my rebate submission because the amazon.com invoice didn't say "final details."  So I have to resubmit it.  Rebates shouldn't require mail-in paperwork.  They should be automatic with amazon.
Excellent battery life, good display, and surprisingly capable for such a thin, lightweight notebook. On the downside, the touchpad could do with some serious improvement, and it comes with a rather large amount of bloatware pre-installed, which is annoying since the Microsoft store offers the same device without it, for the same price. Overall, an excellent value though.
I purchased the Windows 10 core 5 laptop and is very happy with it.<br/>I do not experience over-hot issue like the other reviews do. I had more than three hours now and it is cool, not even warm.<br/>It is very light, good looking and great keyboard to type.<br/>Download is fast and streaming is smooth.<br/>I still likes Windows 7 better but well life moves on.<br/><br/>My only complain is the screen display seems a bit too green than other screens I have used. But I can probably adjust it somewhere.<br/><br/>Overall very good machine and highly recommend.
I've had my Asus Zenbook UX305FA a month now and really like using it. It starts up and shuts down almost instantly. Battery life is around 6 or 7 hours, working on a couple of Word or Excel 2013 files, PDFs, a few photos and maybe up to 10 Chrome tabs open. I don't do any gaming or Photoshopping and my Excel files are quite simple, so not a heavy workload for pc. No fan noise, beautifully silent. The power charger has fixed leads with USA socket plug one end and micro jack the other; fixed, so if you don't live in USA you cannot simply swap the charger (or even one lead) to one with a different nation's electricity socket fitting. I use a USA socket adapter; it means carrying around another (small) bit of gear, no big deal but you have to remember it. The keyboard has good sized keys, plenty of space between keys and the travel of keys is fine for me; I don't find it tiring to type on it. I thought I'd miss having backlighting on the keyboard but actually not having it is not a problem. I normally plug in a mouse rather than use the trackpad (?is that what you call it?) on a laptop for navigation; I've never liked trackpads - too tiring on index finger! A few times I've not had mouse and found that the cursor would hop mid-word to unexpected location now and again so my typing continued in wrong spot - something to do with me unwittingly touching the trackpad, or trackpad 'thinking' I did. That trackpad bug in laptops irritates me, hence I plug in the mouse by habit. The screen is beautifully clear and focussed and glare has not been a problem when I've worked outside - though it is a covered patio. Using Asus on my knee: comfortable to type, screen angle is fine for me, doesn't get hot on legs and no hot air blowing from (non-existent) fan vents; the only slight niggle is that there's a ridge on underneath of the Asus near the hinge edge and that ridge is a bit uncomfortable on my thighs. I sometimes use a cushion under the laptop - no fan vents so no problems with blocking the airflow. I recommend buy it if your budget is around USD600 - it's a whole lot of laptop for that price.
I've had this computer for about 3 months now and I love it! The battery is super long lasting which is great (I'm a college student and I love never having to bring my charger to campus with me), it's super light, and it's worked great for me so far! I upgraded it to windows 10 when I bought it and had some issues with the scroll feature on the mouse pad (two finger scroll wasn't working) but eventually was able to get it to work by reinstalling a driver I think. I also have had the display driver fail and restart a few times (screen will go black for 1-2 seconds, come back with a message saying the display driver failed and recovered). The computer battery also gets pretty hot when it's plugged in and charging and I'm using it sometimes, but this is mostly when I have it in my lap or bed (not so much when it's on a table). Other reviews say the touchpad feels cheap, which it kind of does when you click down on it. I mostly just use a tap on the touchpad to click and I don't have to deal with the slightly clunky touchpad. It isn't terrible but definitely isn't great. I'd say that's probably the worst feature of the computer. The speakers don't get too loud, but loud enough for watching shows or listening to music somewhere not too loud. So far the computer has been very fast and able to handle pretty much everything I've thrown at it. The one time it kind of glitched out was when I was running MATLAB (a program for engineering classes) and was trying to run a really long script, and the computer eventually either quit out of the program or gave an error about not having enough memory. I then ran the script on a computer on campus and that computer wasn't able to run it either, so I don't think it's much of a shortcoming. Overall so far I love this computer, huge step up from my last laptop which was about 4 years old and SO slow, and affordable for a poor college student! Definitely would recommend.
It just works!<br/>After much research, I waffled between the well reviewed Asus and the Dell ultrabooks.  Mostly because of the price differential, I went for the Asus.  After my first work road trip, I think its the perfect road warrior.  It starts up instantly, lasts all day without plugging in, is so much faster than the 4 year old laptop it replaced that it shocks me, and it is so light and thin, I don't hesitate to take it with me to meetings.  In a meeting with mostly MacBook Air coworkers, the Asus stands apart.  It has better storage, connections and speed, runs windows 10 for my work, and is different from the apple crowd, which I like (even though I love Apple).<br/>PROS:<br/>* Performance- Blazing speed, power, screen, weight and size, great keyboard, amazing battery life, and instant on/off.<br/>* As portable as a tablet, but it has a real "type on your lap watching football" utility of the laptop form.<br/>* Value- direct competitor to MacBook air and Dell XPS, but hundreds of dollars less.  WIth rebate, this was $500 less than Apple.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>* lower show-off factor. Dull purplish color doesn't draw attention or admiration.  If you want to brag about your smart shopping, you are going to have to start the conversation, because only other geeks currently shopping for laptops will get how smart the purchase is.  Like buying a Hyundai.<br/>* Took me a day to get it functional, due to many updates, including a windows 8 to 10 update that then led to a new touchpad update, since the Win 10 killed the 2 finger scrolling until I updated.  Absolutely fine since then, but give yourself a day if you need it for your work and you update to 10.<br/>Other stuff I noticed on others reviews:  No buyers remorse at all.  No heat problems.  My old HP travel laptop with fan was way warmer. No wifi/connectivity problems.  Asus online support was minimal and took 24 hours, but I had already googled touchpad windows 10 issue and found solution myself in an hour.  I like Windows 10 way better than 8.  Not an issue not to have a touchscreen with a good touchpad.  Best keyboard feel I have found for me.  I have a work Lenovo laptop, but I like this lighter keyboard feel better.
I needed to get a laptop to use on the road to support my sales effort and after much research I went with this one, purchased online through B&H; in NY. They offered free shipping and a $50 rebate on the Titanium gold model (MFR # UX305FA-RBM1-GD).<br/><br/>This machine is sleek. It just looks exotic and sophisticated. It has a beautiful screen and really is very very well built.<br/><br/>It is also light. Very light. I pack this ultrabook with all my other documents and information manuals in a leather business tote and forget it's in there. It's probably the lightest item in the tote.<br/><br/>I've used both the wireless network connection as well as the included wired connector. Both work well and have supported my use of online apps from google and zoho with no problems.<br/><br/>Within a few minutes of unboxing the device I had started to upgrade it to windows 10 and that went without a hitch. The boot-time is so short I think it'll boot before I can count to 10 - before I'd boot and go grab a cup of coffee. Now I grab the coffee and then boot. I use it mainly for MS Office but I also have some of my ham radio apps installed too and I have loaded on Photoshop CS5 which works but which I would not utilise consistently on this platform. My experience overall is very positive. All the regular office apps work perfectly. The ham radio apps: writelog, dx4win and n1mm all work fantastically well - pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Conclusion: This is a lot of ultrabook for the price. It works well but I would not really try to use for professional video-editing, photo-editing or page-layouts. It presents a very professional look and having hooked up to external monitors I've found it very easy to do with a $7 micro-HDMI cable I purchased with the unit. I also suggest something like the Amazon Basics 13.3in case http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-NC1303152-13-3-Inch-Laptop-Sleeve/dp/B00CD8AF48/ref=pd_sim_147_2?ie=UTF8&refRID;=0VPZ1022E3NHK76ER14D&dpID;=41Iw5pUfTPL&dpSrc;=sims&preST;=_AC_UL160_SR160%2C160_ to keep it clean and protected when not in use. Battery life is also great and I usually leave home with a fully charged unit and between use at the office and on the road over  8-10 hrs I'm still able to use when I return home. It is great bang for the buck and one of the best buys in ultrabooks if you are on a budget.
Hi all,<br/><br/>Don't normally post reviews and there are already many great/accurate reviews of this product, but I wanted to echo those reviews with my own thoughts. I am a college student who uses my laptop primarily for research, online collaboration (google docs/etc), streaming media, and Microsoft Office.<br/><br/>I was really trying to find the best bang for my buck when buying a laptop this time around, thus I bought this Zenbook. I have only had it a few days so far, but I couldn't be happier with my purchase.<br/><br/>I think ASUS really put quality inputs in this machine where it matters and kept costs down by passing on the "flashy" bonuses of many high end laptops (i.e. backlit keyboard, touchscreen, etc.). Originally I was concerned that the core M processor may be a little slow, but I must say the Zenbook has performed great for my expectations. Between the core M, 8 gigs of RAM, and the SSD the laptop runs quickly.<br/><br/>As many others have pointed out the trackpad is very loud haha. Based on reviews I knew it'd be loud, but it was even louder than I thought. This is not a big deal to me, but it could affect your purchasing decision based on your preferences.<br/><br/>My final recommendation is to buy this laptop if you are looking for a value packed machine that can perform the typical tasks of a professional/college student/average laptop user. If you are a power user of any kind I would imagine you would benefit from a more expensive machine with a little more meat to it, but for the price this Zenbook is tough to beat.<br/><br/>One last recommendation. Go buy this on the Microsoft online store. There is currently a 100 dollar instant rebate. If that instant rebate is gone you can still use the "education discount" to get 10% off.
I really like the Asus Zenbook and it out performs my expectations. It is super light, boots up quickly and has performed well with everything I have thrown at it.<br/><br/>I am a web developer and this is my out of office machine. I needed a Windows machine with full keyboard, a few USB connectors a decent battery life and a reasonable price. At $699 Asus UX305 fits the bill very nicely.<br/><br/>I was a bit worried about the keyboard as I am used to a full sized keyboard. The keyboard is definitely different but still very good. It is chiclet style but has a good feel and decent travel on the keys. Don't expect this to to be the same as full sized keyboard or even a 15.6" laptop keyboard. Do expect it to perform well and be pleasant to use.<br/><br/>Performance wise I read the reviews on the Intel M processor and expected it to be slower than it actually is. It is not as fast as my desktop but it doesn't have the same spec., costs 2/3rd less and my full size gaming desktop is just a wee bit awkward to carry around!<br/><br/>Battery wise it runs around 5-6 hrs depending on what you are working on. This is not up to Mac Air standards but still very respectable for a machine at this price.<br/><br/>The trackpad, in limited use, seems to be fine but I tend to use a mouse.<br/><br/>The machine does have a view limitations which may or not be important to you. Because of the small footprint there is no separate numeric pad nor easy Home/End buttons. When it is being charged the area above the keyboard does get a wee bit as does the underneath of the unit. On battery mode it stays pretty cool. Remember this is a fanless unit so heat has to dissipate somewhere. The flip side of this is that the Asus Zenbook is also super quite which I really appreciate.<br/><br/>In summary this is a fabulous machine for the money and I recommend it.
This ultrabook is engineered to be both portable and lightweight. It came with an ethernet USB dongle, adapter (unclosable prong), manual, and some accessories. Beware that the dongle may lose connection as it have happened to me but I haven't tested it fully to resolve the issue yet. The design is entirely consist of aluminum which itself felt premium and assist in dissipating heat away from internal components.<br/><br/>Battery life has been sufficient in watching videos and while 10 hours was advertised it's clearly depends on what activities it's undergoing plus the settings. The Lithium-Polymer battery is located inside the case and it's not advised to replace it yourself as it'll void the warranty under their policy. It's best to discharge the battery once per month for calibration and since it's Lithium, you shouldn't fully charge (100%) nor deep discharge (10%) it.<br/><br/>The keyboard is an improvement over my predecessor: HP Pavilion Dv6z-3k. It's big enough and provide enough feedback for me to type fast. However, with the absence of certain keys (power button, pg down, pg up..etc), some users will find this as a dealbreaker but it's completely acceptable for me.<br/><br/>The screen is matte finish, so no glare in contact with light and provide 1080p resolution. Initially the setup for the default screen resolution is awkward as you need to adjust the scaling to make everything fit due to some windows appearing in lower resolution. Some may prefer a larger screen but it's user dependent on what type of viewing experience they prefer. The screen lid will fall back if held down enough.<br/><br/>Zenbook UX305FA has the Intel Core M 5Y10 with Intel HD Graphics 5300. This is the only reason why I bought this machine: ultimate heat efficiency. This has no fans or moving parts involve and no noise either. Comparing with the new Macbook, I felt choosing this is the better choice, not because of its specs but also of choosing something different.<br/><br/>Asus proved that they discovered something incredible.
First, I want to give a tip to other owners that I think could be a big help:<br/>-Out of the box, the speakers seem way underpowered.  I like to set my laptop on the coffee table and listen to podcasts.  At even at the highest volume setting, this laptop was not playing loud enough.  What worked for me was this.  First, hit Windows Key + S, then type in AudioWizard, and select it.  In the settings, select "Off."  (Default was "Music Mode" for me).  This will actually make the volume lower.  But then, hit Windows Key + S, SmartAudio.  In the "SmartEq/3d Settings" move all the levers to the top.  With this combination, I was able to get a reasonable volume level with little to no distortion.<br/><br/>Here's my review:<br/><br/>Positives<br/>-The biggest plus for me was this: no fan.  There is something so nice to a completely silent laptop. (Despite the no fan, the bottom doesn't get too hot for top of the lap comfort. I think my Dell XPS 13 with an i7 4500u that did have a fan, got much warmer on the bottom than this does.)<br/>-Amazingly thin (<0.5 inch)<br/>-Super light at 2.6 lbs<br/>-Even with a Core M, I find the laptop speedy. Going from a Dell XPS 13 with a Core i7-4500u processor to this laptop technically involves a 25% drop in processor speed, but I haven't noticed a big difference in every day use (web browsing, YouTube, mkv viewing, Word, Excel)<br/>-Comfortable, responsive, pleasant to use keyboard.<br/>-Good 1080p matte screen (would be nice if Asus makes the bezels smaller in a future version, but this is purely an aesthetic issue.)<br/><br/>Negatives<br/>-Very weak out of the box speakers (but tweakable per my instructions at the top)<br/>-Touchpad is fine most of the time, but sometimes doesn't register soft touch taps or double clicks.  I have a feeling this is a driver issue, but I am experiencing this as of the latest SmartGesture driver at the time of writing: 3.0.8.  To clarify though, I'd say 90%+ of touchpad gestures are registered, it's just that last 10% that I find the glitch with.<br/>-The top cover attracts finger prints extremely easily.  I used to have a Dell XPS 13 which also had a metal cover, but Dell put some sort of coating or texture to the metal that obscured most fingerprints.  Not sure why Asus didn't do the same, as they even bothered to include a cleaning cloth with the laptop as they were clearly cognizant of this problem.  Even with a cloth the fingers prints don't come out.  You actually need to wet the top of the screen a bit and then wipe to get them out.  Annoying, but this may or may not be a big issue for you.
Okay, so I've had this computer for about 5 months now. It's been a fantastic laptop for school and work, but it does have some minor issues.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>It's insanely light and small and the charger is tiny! It's super easy to pack this up and take it somewhere.<br/>It charges quickly and maintains a charge for about 5 hours of continuous use on moderate battery settings.<br/>The brushed metal casing has a great look and feel, and is pretty sturdy - haven't scratched it yet (knock on wood).<br/>Windows 8 actually works better than I had anticipated, especially considering this ultrabook is not a touch screen.<br/>It rarely heats up and is SILENT... gotta love that SSD and Intel chipset.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The display driver crashes every so often and reboots - the screen goes dark, but it always starts back up within seconds. It's disconcerting, but it doesn't bother me too much. I would like to see a patch for that, though, just because I freak out a little every time it happens.<br/>The wi-fi adapter's connection speed drops to a crawl if I'm too far from the modem - and too far seems to be in the next room, which is pretty lame. Right now, I'm sitting about 12 feet from the box, and the connection is zippy. But if I walk into the kitchen, it takes AGES to load a page. None of my other devices have this issue, including my older Asus notebook that this replaced, and I'm certain it is not my modem/router.<br/>It's not a touch screen - boo.<br/><br/>Overall, I am very happy with it, and the only standout issue is with the wifi adapter. I will update my review with the results if I find a way to either fix the adapter or if I purchase an external USB unit.
The laptop is thin and lightweight indeed, and looks beautiful. The screen is nice and bright. The processor and RAM is sizable enough for doing actual work on it, not only browsing and watching movies.<br/>My teenager is the programmer for his high school team, he uses the laptop there, and he says his software works without a snag. It is great for schoolwork, too. The laptop did not come with office installed.<br/>The touchpad works great, and I love the gestures for scrolling and zooming in and out, this kind of compensates for no touch screen. The power button is conveniently located right next to backspace and delete, and it looks and feels like other buttons. so in case you mistype anything, there will be not so slim chance the wrong letter would be deleted immediately with all your work alongside it, if you had not bothered to save before hitting that delete button. Yes, the button was assigned "sleep" function right away so this would not happen, but why did they do that? There is also a separate sleep button. I would have preferred them using those for something else and having completely separate power button somewhere where it would not be hit on accident while typing fast.<br/>The battery life is concerning, though. It says right on the sticker attached to the top of the display 12 hours battery life. After fully charging it, and working for 15 minutes on the battery, it said over 5 hrs left. I so not know what they mean when they said 12 hours, it certainly does not look like that at all. So far my son had been lucky to find an outlet near where he works, but I am not sure it will always be the case.
I bought this from BB with 8ghz ram and 256ssd  It is a beautiful, thin, light weight, well constructed NB.  It comes with Windows 8.1 with the free Windows 10 upgrade.<br/><br/>On first boot I upgraded the UX305 to Windows 10. The upgrade killed the smart gestures, and audio. Smart Gestures were ez enough to reinstall.  Audio, I can't seem to locate the drivers/audio package/amplifier.Without the audio package the speakers are inaudible.<br/><br/> Ahh, the lovely m 5y10 processor.  What a dog.  Why did intel make this processor? Reduced power consumption is a worthy goal, but not at the cost of turning performance back to the celeron days.  Besides being painfully slow, the spinning wheel randomly pops up, its annoying and I am not sure what it is accomplishing.<br/><br/>The display is good with the matte finish, no reflections, and it can be viewed outside. The automatic adaptive brightness is a major distraction, however it is a windows issue not a hardware.  The hinge is horrible, out of the box it has about .5-inches of play, that will only get worse.<br/><br/>8 gig of ram and a 256ssd are impressive, as is the fanless operation. I am not a tech person, but I wonder why all the ram is needed for such a slow processor.<br/><br/>The machine has numerous bugs and glitches that are more annoying that debilitating.  Individually they aren't that bad, but the cumulative effect is so frustrating.<br/><br/>I don't know how this runs on Windows 8.1.  If it seems ok, then stay away from Win 10 and the hassles associated with drivers, software, etc.<br/><br/>This notebook is an upgrade to nothing I have ever owned.
This is a very handsome unit, thin and light. Do not get the brown/purple color, but surely is not a deal breaker. I bought it at the Microsoft Store for 599, a very good deal! After spending several days with it, I've decided to return it. Two deal breakers have caused the return, this unit just runs too warm during simple tasks and really heats up when you push the CPU. I don't think the aluminum case helps at all and I thought the M class CPU was intended to run cool. And good god, what is it about Asus and the color rendition on their displays? There is a yellow tint to most images while surfing the net and even shows on my wallpapers. I did everything from adjusting and uninstalling the ridiculous "splendid app" and made several tweaks to the intel HD graphics app. I never could get it right!
The is a good notebook for the price, but don't count on it for long battery life.  It arrives with the screen set on a pretty dim setting.  Once you adjust the screen for good visibility in normal light, the battery life in normal usage is no more than a few hours.
I agree with many other reviewers...<br/><br/>Sleek look, fast operating system, beautiful screen, perfect size, and responds well to multiple internet tabs/programs/documents being up at the same time (which was the most important to me as a full time career professional and part time student). Video has been good; speaker output is just okay. It has enough USB ports and an SD card reader as well. And, it's wonderfully thin and lightweight, which makes it perfect for a person who is on the go all the time!<br/><br/>Annoyances:<br/>The power button is where the delete button typically is and is designed in the same style as any other keyboard button. This really got on my nerves at first, as I kept powering off in the middle of documents (and occasionally still do).  I had a little Asus netbook previously where they managed to separate the power button, so there's definitely room to do that here.<br/><br/>The touch pad brings me back to the home windows screen occasionally when I am working, and I still don't understand what move would prompt that response.<br/><br/>The lack of back lit keys is not something you think will ever be an issue until you have to type in a dimly lit place!  Still, it's not a deal breaker for me as I am usually working in an area with sufficient light.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, for this type of operating system at this price point, I would purchase the exact same computer again!
I have been using my new Zenbook 305 for about a week now and I really love it.  It took me some time to choose a laptop because there are so many out there!  I looked at Chromebooks, Macbooks and touch screen 2-in-1 laptops.  I finally decided on this Zenbook because it seems powerful enough and have enough storage and memory to suit my purposes without paying for just more machine that I really needed.<br/><br/>I am a pretty typical computer user:  I shop, use social media and email on my computer.  I'm not a gamer I don't use graphic intensive programs.  What I was looking for in a laptop was something that would be comfortable to use - light, quiet, and stay cool.  I wanted a no glare screen and had no use for a touch screen device. I wanted something that had a battery that lasted a decent amount of time but I didn't need an ultra expensive machine that was reported to last an obscene amount of time.  Access to plug in is not a problem for me.<br/><br/>The Zenbook 305 fit every one of my needs.  It's large enough that I don't feel like I am squinting to see (like some of the 11 inch models)  and it's not so huge that I feel I'm carrying around a t.v.  The Zenbook is super light and thin, it doesn't make a sound...at all...and it stays comfortably cool while in use.  The boot up is really fast and it recharges quickly as well.<br/><br/>Overall I think this is a great device and WELL worth the money.
A very good laptop for the typical college student. I take this to class with ease. It makes no awkward loud noises! Super light and thin and can fit in any bag. I want the white one to come out so I can get it for my girlfriend!
What I love most about this laptop is the form factor. Extremely light and thin. Easy to pick up and go with. Very fast, can open multiple tabs on my browser, listen to videos, and read articles without any hiccups. I can open and close the laptop and it instantly resumes from where I left off. This is good for people who are looking to do everyday tasks on the go.  I would not recommend this laptop if you are looking to do work that requires heavy processing as the processor just isn't meant for that. It's also not much of an entertainment machine considering the average speakers and intel graphics card. One great thing about the UX305 is the keyboard, which feels great and is very comfortable to use. The touchpad is big and works well, although the buttons feel awkward to press (feels flimsy). And lastly, the battery is not bad, but not as great as I hoped.Having used it for the past few days, it feels like I'm getting between 4-5 hours. The power adapter is nice though, small with a long cord, that is easy to tuck into your laptop bag. Overall though, I still love this laptop!<br/><br/>**One thing I forgot to mention: I noticed that the monitor has a tendency to sway back if you lift the laptop from the front. It seems like a minor design flaw to me. Doesn't bother me too much as it only happens in those kinds of circumstances.
Hello everyone, I just received mine today and I must say I'm enjoying it.<br/><br/>But I just had a question to others about the packaging..<br/>Mine came WITHOUT the cable ties like the unboxing videos I've watched<br/><br/> and had everything in a seal under the laptop that had screen wipe, warranty card and a little manual all supported by a carboard.<br/>and cables + Ethernet usb<br/><br/>Just curious as to how others got it. Got mine (June 26, 2015)<br/><br/>USING the device:<br/>I've only been playing with the device for a little bit now and the only issue is the driver failure crash once in a while and the trackpad is unbearable coming from a Macbook Pro. I love how Windows 8 come preinstalled and as soon as you get you computer set up it asks you to reserve a Windows 10.<br/><br/>I've only been doing basics like browsing the web with Google Chrome, watching Youtube, Facebook Messenger.<br/><br/>Also a bit of html, css, javascript with SublimeText and testing it out on Chrome.<br/><br/>I've only been using this laptop for a couple hours now and I'd say the driver failure happened about 3 or 4 times. Nothing serious though. The screen goes black for about 2~4 seconds and come right back. Hope this is just a Windows 8 issue that will be resolved in the upcoming Windows 10.<br/><br/>Thanks~
So far, this thing is marginal.  Looks nice, is solid.  Wifi problems regularly in first 48 hours, cutting out regularly.  Trackpad blows big time.  I just downloaded the ASUS trackpad drivers and now I don't have to click it as often which helps.  Still this trackpad is clunky at best.  So far attempts to go to Win 10 with all updates installed has been futile.  The key update needed is not being installed by Windows update and the tool Microsoft provides flags this.  How to get it ? wait says Microsoft.  Other issues, power button in bizarre location on keyboard above the backspace. The light there also which indicates sleep, power etc. confuses me regularly.  Oh and the silly raising of the base of the laptop when the lid is opened completely is just plain dumb.  If on slippery surface once the lid lifts the laptop off the surface it slides all over the place.  And if you are at a location where you are much higher than the laptop and want to open the lid more than about 120 degrees you can't.  This thing won't open all the way up or even to a reasonable distance past where you would use it if it was in your lap.  I never saw this as a problem before but now keep running into it.  I'm pretty sure this thing is going back but I'll try for a few days and see if it doesn't grow on me cause the price is FANTASTIC.
The Good:<br/>- Lightweight<br/>- Easy, comfortable keyboard experience<br/>- Silent or near silent operation<br/>- Does not generate an uncomfortable amount of heat - in fact usually none, or imperceptible<br/>- Can handle several browser tabs while having several other apps open (haven't experienced a slowdown yet)<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/>- No touch screen. This is fine for me, as I don't really see much use in it for my particular case<br/>- The speakers are bad. They're quiet and odd sounding. Luckily, this is also fine as I rarely if ever intend to use them. I have headphones for when I need audio.<br/>- No Discrete Graphics — I’m not doing any real gaming or video editing on this thing, so again, don't really care.<br/><br/>In the end, this is the right machine for the job for me. I'm looking for a machine that I can set up the exact same apps and file structure (and cloud storage sync) as my desktop. I want to use it for all of my writing, and to do freelance dev work (I'm a web developer and writer) when I'm on breaks at work, or travelling with my family, or want to hangout and watch tv downstairs while researching a topic or something. It's perfect for all of that. No problems so far. The only thing I really miss are backlit keys for working in dark rooms, but I've already gotten over that.
Great laptop, its very thin, very light, very quiet (fanless), and very fast boot up!<br/><br/>I bought this primarily to watch videos, music, and web browsing but didn't want something heavy or bulky and this fit the bill nicely.<br/><br/>I upgraded to Windows 10 without issues.<br/>I would recommend uninstalling any extra software that is included.<br/>SSD performs better if the drive isn't too full, and you'll reclaim a little space from the extra software, and it'll keeps the system cleaner.  You'll have to decide for yourself which you want and which you don't.<br/><br/>There are a few things that are a nuisance (although doesn't take away from the 5* because I knew ahead of time before purchasing).<br/><br/>The keyboard isn't back lit.<br/>The shell gets covered with finger prints and are very visible, so if have clammy hands, you're gonna see lots of finger and hand prints on the shell.<br/>The screen isn't touch, with Windows 8 and Windows 10, it is very touch screen friendly, this would have been nice to have, but not necessary.  I would imagine within 3 years I can see all laptops going touch with the way MS is headed, and would have nice to delay an upgrade.<br/><br/>I haven't tested battery life yet, but for what I use it for, I don't think it'll be a big concern.
I've had this notebook for just a few days now, but here are my first impressions:<br/>It's almost same size and weight as a 13" Macbook Air, feels very solid, the initial setup was brief, not much bloatware (WildTangent Games comes to mind). The screen is way better than Apple's. The body doesn't get hot. The CPU can easily deal with typical work; however, don't expect to play intensive video games on it, as its integrated video can't do miracles.<br/><br/>My conclusions:<br/>The good: solid, high-quality build, excellent full HD screen with great viewing angles and color reproduction, great battery life, quiet as a mouse (well, technically quieter, as it has no moving parts, e.g. fans, HDD). Sound quality is great, but max. volume is on the low side; it's ok for a quiet environment (such as an apartment), but not outdoors. ASUS offers a 1 year Accidental Damage Protection for free. The fast CPU and SSD make for a very responsive notebook, with fast boot times and instant program starts.<br/><br/>The bad: keyboard not lighted, no touchscreen, Windows 8. There are just time-limited licenses for Microsoft Office and McAfee antivirus.<br/><br/>The ugly: Annoying registration process on Asus's webpage for the above mentioned 1 year Accidental Damage Protection.
Computer was ordered for girlfriend who will use it for work - MS Office and internet mainly. The laptop seems to have a quality build and feels sturdy. The screen is not as vibrant as her 2010 macbook pro, but I think it looks very crisp and nice. The speakers are not as loud as the old macbook also, but they are fine to watch a youtube video here and there. As for performance, it opens Word and Excel quickly and seems to run them without any problems or lag. The same goes for internet browsing on Chrome and IE. As some other reviewers have mentioned, the color is not actually black or grey. When in the light, it appears to be a plum purple color. My girlfriend likes this very much. In low light it's hard to tell that it's not just a dark grey/black. With three usb 3 ports, sd card reader, and micro hdmi out, there is plenty of connectivity. The overall package, especially considering there's 8GB ram and 256GB ssd, is an extremely good value. The quality overall is not quite at mac level, but you'd have to pay hundreds more for less ram and smaller ssd. I ordered this pc from the microsoft store which had a $100 off promo code, so for $600 plus tax the value is unbeatable.
Running ubuntu on it, installed quickly and haven't had much problem using the laptop at all. The backlight doesn't work out of the box with ubuntu, but xbacklight and keybinds can fix that.
I really wanted to love this laptop, and to be honest, I did. As soon as I took it out of the box it was love at first sight. This thing is GORGEOUS! It's so thin, light, and overall aesthetically pleasing. I told my roommate I bought a new laptop and when she saw it she thought I had bought a macbook.<br/><br/>Overall review<br/>I had the i5 version, which held up really well for the duration that I had the laptop (about 2-3weeks), and i would have kept the laptop except one day upon booting up the computer I noticed the AWFUL backlight bleed. I love asus products, but they've always had bleeding issues and I'm honestly very sad that they choose to continue money over better quality control for their portable devices.<br/><br/>Screen<br/>The screen is nice, to me it felt a little too grainy though. I didn't notice it when watching things, but when working on things where there was a lot of white on the screen I noticed the grainy texture a lot and it sort of hurt my eyes in a weird way. To me it made the display seem kind of cheap. Maybe I'm just too used to glass cellphone screens, since as of right now I only have my samsung s4, and my pc with an asus monitor. The only other issue I had with the screen was the awful backlight bleeding. I didn't really notice it until about 2 weeks into owning the laptop, since I usually let it boot up while doing something else. The bleeding was on all edges of the laptop, but the bottom left corner was the worst. On black backgrounds it was going so far into the screen it was unbelievable. I've attached some pictures for reference on this issue. There is actually one more issue, and that is the scaling. I left it on the recommended 125%, but some applications and even some webpages were just straight up blurry. This was especially annoying because I'm a student and tend to do a lot of reading in the form of research, so reading a 30 page journal was not fun when the words were somewhat blurry.<br/><br/>Trackpad<br/>I had no issues with the trackpad over then it felt sorta slow when scrolling. I never tried changing the speed, so I don't know if I'm able too (others have said its not possible, but I don't think this is the case). Other then that, it's a little weird to get used to, as my last laptop was from 2011, a dell xps 15 with which the trackpad and buttons were seperated, so it was a bit of an adjustment for me getting used to having the trackpad and buttons on the same area.<br/><br/>Processing/Power<br/>I loved the speed of the laptop. I mainly used it for watching media, and web browsing, as I wasn't sure if I wanted to stretch the boundaries with gaming considering the fan design isn't made to keep things especially cool while under a heavy load, but from my experience the laptop did well. I didn't experience any lagging from what I can remember.<br/><br/>Wifi<br/>My wifi worked relatively well. I live in a dorm, and the internet isn't great to begin with, so I couldn't tell if it was my laptop or the wifi that would once in a while drop, or go down to a very low connection despite being maybe 15 feet away from the router. However, when I was sitting in the living room [where the router is located] I had no issues keeping the wifi connected, so I'm just going to assume that its my dorm room walls that like to create a dead zone once in a while (I also get zero cell signal in my dorm room on verizon).<br/><br/>Overall:<br/>I love this laptop, and if I wasn't so scared that I will become enveloped in an infinite loop of returning because of the various quality control issues that asus tends to have on their mobile devices, I wouldn't hesitate to repurchase this laptop. It's absolutely gorgeous, and such a good price for what you get, as most other laptops I was interested in were $900+, but alas, it was not meant to be. With the new generation cpu already out, I'll most likely be biting the bullet and getting back to my roots and picking up the new xps 15. I loved my old one, and it help up the test of time, but I was ready for an upgrade, and so it made a new home with a family member of mine.
Product: ASUS Zenbook UX305LA (with Windows 10) (Amazon tends to lump reviews of related products together)<br/><br/>The ASUS ZenBook hardware is excellent.  I expected to hate Windows 10 since Microsoft has made Windows worse with each version after WinXP) but surprisingly Windows 10 is not annoying at all and so far I've found it fairly easy to find and configure anything I needed.  Windows 10 isn't very good for privacy though and I highly recommend reading this article and adjusting your settings: http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2015/08/windows_10_privacy_problems_here_s_how_bad_they_are_and_how_to_plug_them.html<br/><br/>I love taking this laptop on vacation (and leaving the power adapter at home). With light usage after two weeks I still had the battery read 75% charge and 10 hours of life left!  Admittedly my usage is very light and doesn't tax the battery (mostly just reading a Kindle book).  It really does have excellent battery life.  This laptop makes an excellent alternative to having a tablet.<br/><br/>Update: I've been doing some gaming on this laptop.  It makes a pretty good game machine (add a mouse onto it, I dislike using the touchpad for gaming).  The battery power appears to be about 3 to 4 hours while gaming (and the bottom rear edge of the laptop does get fairly hot).  I also did some batch photo editing work.  Very impressive!  Modifying 1145 photos took 29 minutes on my main PC but only 8 minutes on the laptop!  Kudos partly to the SSD drive, partly to 64 bit (vs 32 bit) software and perhaps also to having more RAM.<br/><br/>The 1920 x 1080 screen is excellent.  Boot up and shut down time (largely due to the SSD drive) is fantastic, it takes eight seconds to start up (from powered off state) and one second to shut down (if nothing is running).  I think they are "cheating" by only turning off the display quickly since the power button stays illuminated for a half dozen seconds after the screen has gone blank.<br/><br/>ASUS does preload a few things.  The pop ups encouraging you to use various things are a bit annoying.  I tried turning these notifications off and now the "system" screen locks up frequently. (looks like Microsoft has a few bugs to fix!)  I'd far prefer that they shipped it with ONLY Windows and provide extra software on a flashdrive (since this laptop doesn't have a optical drive).  Still with only loading a few things of my own I am only using 34.3 GB of the SSD drive.<br/><br/>Windows 10 does have some odd quirks like WordPad is NOT listed under "all apps" yet you can run it. Update: Windows 10 has been a bit weird and had some failures doing updates, but now the new major update "All your files are exactly where you left them" has just updated (even though I turned off Cortana it seems to want to talk to me now) and it seems like there are a few improvements to Win10 now.<br/><br/>In case it isn't obvious, the 13" cases available in local stores fit this laptop with plenty of room to spare.  The laptop is very sturdy and doesn't seem prone to bending but I'd still recommend a padded pouch to protect it from scratches and stray bumps.<br/><br/>Just to be clear: there is no external monitor connector except for the mini HDMI connector (you'll have to buy a cable).<br/><br/>To get into the BIOS you have to very quickly press the F2 "Airplane" key immediately after powering on.<br/><br/>Things I would change:<br/>1) I would make the arrow keys larger - these are smaller than the main keys yet for me they are one of the most frequently used keys.<br/>2) I would *not* put the power button near the backspace key!  It's not a big deal but it is a bit shocking the first time you put the laptop to "sleep" accidentally when you meant to hit backspace.<br/>3) I would make the delete key larger.<br/>4) I miss having a "Windows" key on the right side of the keyboard so that locking the PC with "Windows+L" is just a single hand operation.
UPDATE 09/18/2015: After having installed all of the software that I wish to use, with OS updates and drivers, I upgraded to Windows 10. The process took about 45 minutes (including the download time for 2.7 GB of data). The process was entirely automatic, and the machine even downloaded some Windows updates after the OS was upgraded. I must admit that my detestation for Windows 8.1 was quickly forgotten when using Windows 10. Boot times are about 4 seconds from striking the power button to the start screen. All functions work great, the response is crisp (very notable considering my model uses the "slower" Core M processor) and battery life really does last about 8 hours while connected via Wi-Fi (I was actively using Outlook, frequently sending and receiving emails, surfing, etc.) The outer shell does have a tendency to attract finger prints, but it's not too bad. I bought an HDMI cable that allows connection to standard HDMI ports for use with an external monitor or TV.<br/><br/>I am VERY HAPPY with this ultrabook, and Windows 10 is a huge improvement over Windows 8.1 (then again, what isn't better than 8.1?).<br/><br/>ORIGINAL REVIEW 09/10/2015:  This is a very nice ultrabook. It feels like an Apple MacBook Air - high grade aluminum, solid construction, the screen open and closes smoothly but it feels very solid throughout the process of raising and lowering the screen<br/><br/>The item was packed in the ASUS box (which was well protected) and then it was packed in yet another, slightly larger box (of which was also well protected), and that box was then packed into a larger Amazon box (which was padded fairly well). I bought the Core M processor model. The machine is very thin, very light and very fast. It boots in about 8 seconds (even though Windows 8.1 sucks), and the machine is very, very quiet.<br/><br/>I have worked on the Core i5 model of the same machine and noticed that it was just a little faster than this Core M processor machine, but the hint of extra speed is not worth the extra $150 in cost. There is a C: and a D: partition on the SSD right out of the box, one for the OS (this has about 50 GBs available for programs the user may load, and the other partition is for "Data" which amounts to 127 usable GBs. The machine boasts USB 3.0 ports, SD and HDMI, some of the most commonly used (so I believe). The keyboard is great, providing a perfect amount of key travel and feel when typing, a significant accomplishment for a keyboard that is on something that is so thin.<br/><br/>I read online that it is best to go through "Windows Update" hell and install ALL available drivers, OS updates and software that one wishes to use on the machine BEFORE upgrading to Windows 10. Other users have reported online that they were not able to install some of their software on their computers because the very first thing they did was upgrade to Windows 10 prior to installing the software that was otherwise functional on Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 (of which just sucks).<br/><br/>Programs such as Acrobat 8 Professional, 2010 MS Office Professional and some accounting software installed without any difficulty (shocking when considering that Windows 8.1 sucks).<br/><br/>Lastly, I must admit that I detest Windows 8.1, and I will be upgrading to Windows 10 now that the OS is all up-to-date and all of the software that I want to use has been installed. I will update this review after that process has been attempted and / or completed.
So I received the unit last about 5 days ago and have had a chance to play with it. One thing to note first off is this was thankfully boxed well.  The shipper beat up the outer box, but the box inside was fine, and inside that box is another box that safely stores the unit.  So you should get this in one piece.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Solid build<br/>-No issues with typically business level and entertainment content (streaming)<br/>-Nice and light Keyboard feels good<br/>-Touchpad as good as any I've used (but generally hate touchpads). People complain it is loud to press since the left/right click is loud but you can always use the 1 finger/2 finger taps for the same purpose which are silent.<br/>-Matte screen. Not as brilliant/bright as glossy but a lot less glare<br/>-Battery life has really been solid (watch out for Chrome, it seems to suck battery life)<br/>-Price to value get is at the sweet spot. By the time you get a similar package with the i5 for this price, that will mean there are better things that you'll want to upgrade to and increase the price again. Battery life is pretty good (just fyi Chrome is hard on battery life)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-I don't care about backlighting but this doesn't have it<br/>-Can get a little warm on the bottom near the back (no fan so heats up a bit when CPU is chugging)<br/>-Speakers are whimpy, but expected on a device like this.  Use headphones if you want to get the full audio range.<br/>-Micro-HDMI port is a little finicky/loose.  Cord gets bumped or jiggled and it loses it signal.<br/>-Wifi card is the Intel dual band wireless-N 7265  instead of a wireless ac card. Limits to only a max of 300Mbps on 5.0ghz and doesn't compare well to other high end ultrabook models.<br/>-Fingerprint magnet.<br/><br/>So after playing with it for a few days, I think I'll keep it. I like the whole package generally, and haven't run across anything in the price range that would make me any happier.  This is for light business use, streaming, etc.  Don't expect this to meet your needs for processor heavy tasks like video/picture editing.
Performance-<br/> I am student and bought the laptop after researching for days. No doubt Asus you can’t beat the price for the quality of product. The processor is core M which is fanless and cools passively. No noise what so ever. I don’t notice any lag when doing normal activities like: watching Full HD youtube videos while keeping 4-5 tabs open. With the SSD everything opens very quickly.<br/>Battery Life –<br/>With watching videos, typing, and opening documents I got on average a solid 9ish hours of battery life. (Using power saver mode and using the 3rd smallest brightness setting – which is actually really bright )<br/>Looks-<br/>The laptop is a plum color and feels like a high quality product.<br/>NEGATIVES-<br/>Everything about the laptop is quiet but the trackpad button is so clicky and loud. I normally have and mouse and when I use the trackpad l just double tap to open things so it wasn’t an issue for me at all.<br/><br/>BE SURE TO BUY THE SIGNATURE EDITION! IT COMES WITH ALL THE CRAPWARE/LAGWARE REMOVED.
I am primarily a Linux OS user.  In my consulting work, I had to use some of the Microsoft products and was in search of a light ultrabook to carry with me on trips to client locations.  This is an excellent device to carry around - extremely light.  It has no fans.  I use it primarily for Visio Professional, and Office type documents (WORD, EXCEL, PowerPoint) in LibreOffice (highly recommend).  It book extremely fast - comparable to my Chromebook.  I have not timed it but in a matter of a few seconds it is ready to perform work.  The usb 3 ports are extremely fast also.  I do most of my work from a usb 3 flash drive.  I have purchased a micro-hdmi to DVI cable to connect it to devices for presentation.  It is very sharp.  I uninstalled the anti-virus that came with it and installed AVG (again I highly recommend).  I don't have any negatives about the device - it does exactly what I wanted extremely fast.  I have had the Zenbook about a month and am very pleased with the purchase.
This is a great laptop for the price. At first I wasn't sure if laptop without a fan would be powerful enough for my daily routine but this machine has handled everything I've thrown at it so far. The screen is a terrific display, and being matte is another plus in my book. The standard 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD (partitioned as two 128GB drives out of the box) is another huge benefit at the price point. I'll also say that not including a touchscreen or fingerprint scanners are positives in my book.<br/><br/>I only have two minor complaints that keep this from being a full 5 out of 5. First, and this is the biggest point for me is the charging cable. Yes, the battery life on this laptop is great, but you will need to charge the laptop sometime. The charging cable is a wall wart, a huge negative. The cable is also very short. Ideally in the next revision of the laptop the cord will have a longer length with the power brick in the middle of the cord (like a MacBook Air)<br/><br/>The other minor complaint is the packaged in bloatware. The ASUS software is mostly harmless and easily removed, but the inclusion of McAfee for an antivirus solution required much more time to fully remove and clean. I'm not a huge Windows 8 fan, but there are programs and tweaks you can install to remove most of the Metro interface.<br/><br/>I wish I could give the product a 4.5 out of 5, because in my mind that is truly what it deserves. If ASUS can fix the charging cable, make McAfee optional, and include a Wireless AC card they have a winning product.
Please go take this to a coffee shop or other public place with free wifi and test it before the return period is up.<br/><br/>I am on my second unit, same problem. I can connect to my main wifi account at home, but not my guest account, and I cannot connect to public wifi connections (they all have the little exclamation point by them). In public now - my phone and older dell laptop are connected to the free wifi with no issues. This zenbook will not connect. I've talked with Asus and Microsoft Windows support. Neither have been able to resolve the issue.<br/><br/>I wanted to love this laptop. But not being able to connect to public wifi connections renders it nearly useless. And I am very concerned about Asus's support capabilities. Spent two hours speaking with them and their only resolution was to call me in 48 hours to see if they could find a resolution. We will see - I have yet to hear back.<br/><br/>Two of the exact same laptops with the same issue. Hours of wasted time troubleshooting this week. For $699 I should be able to do something as simple as connect to wifi.<br/><br/>EDIT: This thing still will not connect to my coffee shop's wifi and all support can tell me is that they must have outdated routers. My old dell and phone have no problem connecting there. After some tweaking, I can now connect to my home guest account and my school accounts, but if I can't connect everywhere - what is the point of a portable computer? If I go to the indoor playland so my son can play while I tackle some homework, I have to use my phone for internet access and be sure that everything I need on my laptop is on it before I leave, since I can't get online.<br/>Also, my screen is going black pretty frequently and I get a message that says: "Display adapter stopped working but recovered." It is very annoying and happening more and more. And now the "d" key on the keyboard sticks. Badly. And this is a brand new machine - I am very concerned about this happening more over time. ASUS support seems to be pretty ineffective. I will be returning this, unfortunately. I know a lot of people are raving about this laptop, but I can get more use out of my old dell, and that is not saying much. Perhaps mine is a lemon? I don't know. But I won't be buying another of this same model.
A very solid competitor to the Macbook Air. My wife champions the Macbook Air for her work and what a great machine that is. This laptop has a lot of potential and competes against the Macbook Air in many ways including the battery life. It comes up short, however in a couple of key areas. It is not quite a snappy as the Macbook Air. Understandable given it's a specific mobile processor that the Macbook is not limited by. It also does not have some key refinements like a backlit keyboard and the the quality webcam of the Macbook.<br/><br/>I received a defective unit which was returned by Amazon without question (thank you Amazon). I have had other dealings with this laptop aside from this Amazon experience and I will say that this flawed unit is likely an exception as the other units have been flawless. I highly recommend this laptop to impress yourself and everyone around you.
The 256GB SSD completely died after a little over a month of light use without any warning signs. Went to turn it on one morning and it went straight to the BIOS screen which showed no drives installed. All data was lost.
We have had the ASUS Zenbook UX305LA 13.3-Inch Laptop for a few weeks now.  No major complaints with it.  It is one of the best laptops out there.  It does occassionally not respond as quickly as it should and seems to hang a bit.  It also came with far too much bloatware.  I have one complaint about the keyboard itself.  The delete button is right next to the power button and generally that power button would be a delete button on other laptops so hitting that instantly turns the machine off.  So I feel that is bad placement given need to use delete button fairly often.  What they should have done was to require holding the power button down for a short period of time before it does something.  At least that would prevent accidentally turning off the machine.  Other than those small issues, loving this machine so far.
Overall, it's a really nice laptop, but with the price I got it for (discounted on Microsoft) it makes a great laptop.  I don't have anything really new to add to others review.  It's a real ultrabook that actually comes with a hefty amount of memory.<br/><br/>Main cons for me include<br/>1. the SD card slot is shallow, so the card sticks out like a USB drive.  This is a big bummer for me.  I bought a 128g SD card just to supplement, but can't leave it installed.<br/>2. runs a little slow considering that I don't even use a lot of complicated software<br/>3. power and delete button is in an odd place but hasn't bothered me yet<br/>4. wifi seems slower than what I'm used to<br/><br/>Overall, still a really good deal for a super portable device.  I take it with me everywhere and would definitely recommend it.
A great affordable, yet powerful, ultrabook for those who want to just run Linux without a Windows boot.<br/><br/>Running Ubuntu-Gnome, and was surprised at the battery life, I got 6 hours off a full charge doing random basic tasks (ie. word-processing, internet, music, a few YouTube videos). That is the best battery life I have ever seen a Linux laptop get, as it is a power-hungry OS (installed and configured PowerTop too, which probably helped).<br/><br/>Also no problem with installation, did not have to disable Secure Boot or activate legacy BIOS. Those running non-Ubuntu based distros might have to work a little harder for it.<br/><br/>Hardware worked completely out of the box, aside from the Brightness keys, which is a common issue, and can be controlled through Gnome anyway.
This was one of the best purchase I have ever made. I use this laptop over my PC now. I was looking for a laptop to bring with me to and this is the perfect laptop. Lightweight and long battery life, not to mention its super fast. Don't let windows 8.1 scare you like it scared me initially. I almost never use the start menu where all the apps pop up and people get scared. There's a button where you click to go to the desktop and use it like a previous windows 7. The only downside that I've really had with this product is that my palms towards my thumb side tends to touch the trackpad while i'm typing and so itll click to wherever the mouse is. Somewhat annoying when typing long essays, but that could just be a personal issue. Overall a great product and I would highly recommend it.
Battery life is nowhere near the 10 hours claimed, not that I really expected that long (battery life is a lot like EPA mileage estimates).  But the first couple of charges were down in the 3 to 4 hour range, not much more than the UX31A this replaced.  Recent charges are more in the 5+ hour range, which is about double the UX31A was giving me.  It is slower than the UX31A, for most things that isn't a big deal but I have noticed it when I'm doing software development and have a number of applications open.  The cover scratched the first trip out, something I hadn't seen on previous UX computers. I didn't think I'd miss the backlit keyboard, but I find I do.  Then again, this computer travels really well given its light weight and thin.
UX305LA Core i5 September 2015 US Release Win 10 Pre-Installed<br/>I Pre-Ordered and Received from Amazon on September 15th.<br/>For the money (half of a Macbook Air) it is a very nice option.<br/>I got this for my daughter and I am very pleased with the size and performance. I have reset this thing about twice now (my fault as I messed around with the settings and erased things I shouldn't have) Very easy to start from scratch with Win 10.<br/>The Asus Bloatware is not that bad. I would say about 5 or so programs you need to un-install.<br/>With the SSD drive it has a lightning startup. Ultra Thin package and feels very sturdy.<br/>Battery life depends on brightness level. If you have power savings mode on, it will adjust your brightness to get the full 12 hours it advertises.<br/>If you mess with the brightness at all, it will adjust the battery life. With a full charge and 100% brightness you will get about 3 hours. (have not tested this much yet)<br/>All in all, definitely not up to par with a Macbook, but a very nice second place and excellent for Students or for something light on the go.<br/>My kids play with with Online Minecraft Servers, watch YouTube religiously and log onto Comcast On-Demand all the time. It handles it all like a champ so far.<br/>I did get a wireless mouse and additional keyboard as this is on a stand.<br/>The trackpad is clumsy, but hopefully future hardware updates fix this.<br/>The Microsoft Edge Browser is actually not that bad. I'm a Firefox user, but will give the Edge a few weeks to see what it can do.<br/>My kids don't mind what browser they use as long as they can play their online games.<br/>4 Stars as it is a very nice package, but as I said, definitely not a Macbook.<br/>However, for the money the UX305LA cant be beat.
This laptop does have some problem with the graphics card. I dont know if its because of windows 10 but the graphics driver would stop working but recovers right away. It gets annoying because sometimes it would happem 2-3 times a day but it doesnt that often anymore. Overall the laptop is really good. Its fast and really light and the battery life is pretty good compared to many other laptops. The sound is okay but not as loud as mac, but it is good enough? Sometimes it gets hot if u play mid intense games if vent it, it should be fine. I dont know if theres a problem with the mouse trackpad but when i tapit twice, it wont double click anymore. It used to tho. If the keyboard has back light, it wouldve been perfect.
1) Lighter than macbook air<br/>2) Faster than macbook air<br/>3) Great great great spec at a very very genuine price<br/>4) Color (I got golden) is sexy<br/>5) Keyboard is great as well<br/>6) Trackpad responds really nice (gives the mac feel)<br/><br/>Only flaw so far, is that I the power button is placed placed on the keyboard next to delete button. I pressed a few times by mistake and that makes my computer sleep. Although it can be configured to "do nothing" in the control panel. Having said that, i consider this not as a flaw but a major design blunder<br/><br/>I am going to comeback to write na updated review after a few days of use.
What a great little ultrabook, and I do mean little. The pictures provided don't do it justice. The unit is barely thicker than a USB port. The included USB to gigabit ethernet adapter is a nice thought but really unnecessary for most as the integrated wifi is plenty quick. Performance on this new intel process is great. The unit is zippy when it comes to playing back full 1080p video content and doesn't stutter at all with resource intense programs like adobe premier. I took this ultrabook on an extended 13 hour flight and still had 25% battery remaining when I landed and that was with WiFi enabled. Can't really ask for much more than that.
this laptop is very flimsy and light，I love it,and there is no noise.The battery enough to use 10 hours.
This machine definitely offers a lot at the price. A lot of fingerprints!<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Lots of storage and memory (at price range).<br/>It is very fast though and great for what I need it.<br/>Can VMware a simple Linux desktop just fine.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>the touchpad being so big and iffy. Sometimes it gets confused when you've rested a finger on the clicker and the other is moving around<br/>the right shift key's sensor isn't always activated. i tend to get my pinky on the very edge of it and that's almost never a good spot.<br/>it's said that wifi range isn't great, but it is still better than an iphone5's :)
Hardware is great. A beautiful screen, a keyboard that feels good to the touch and doesn't have any randomly place errant buttons (I'm looking at you, all chromebooks). It's light, it's portable, it's sleek.<br/><br/>I wasted an hour trying to get two finger gestures to work out of the box. Not intuitive that it's an ASUS program and bios update required and, and, and. I ended up getting angry enough to dump Windows entirely and replace it with Ubuntu.<br/><br/>We're purring along now, and the hardware is doing great. I imagine with enough personalization, the software will match the experience.
Revised review after additional troubleshooting:<br/><br/>There are documented issues with both the Intel adapter and Windows 8.  Most of the time, it seems like the machine works beautifully, but in some cases, the wifi is very unstable.  The easiest and most reliable fix is what a commenter mentioned - simply disable the internal adapter and get an external one.<br/><br/>If I needed a Windows machine, that is what I would have done, but over a decade of dealing with various versions of Windows has finally taken its toll and I returned the machine.  I no longer have the time nor inclination to care for such a fussy OS.  I'm not computer illiterate, just spoiled by other devices that are effortless in comparison.  I've lost my patience with Microsoft.<br/><br/>If you can deal with the typical issues that always crop up with Windows, this is a great machine.  Fast, light, great price.  And it is more likely to work than not to.  Just be sure the return policy is good.
This is my first week with the Zenbook and I absolutely love it. I have been running Ubuntu on a range of laptops for several years, and I would have to say this has been my most pleasant experience so far. Installed Ubuntu 14.04 without issue, with only the screen brightness as the issue -- which this fixed: https://github.com/thezerobit/asus-zenbook-ux305fa<br/><br/>The laptop is sleek, light, and works perfectly for working on the bus. It is the best Ubuntu Laptop I have ever worked on and is definitely worth the price.
As advertised.<br/><br/>Compact, sleek, capable. Not for gamers or those running multiple resource intense programs at the same time.<br/><br/>Two major areas of deficiencies are volume output and keyboard. Few of my keys are slanted after repeated use (F4 key)<br/><br/>The volume output is minor issue for me as I purchased this as a mobile unit and I tend to carry headphones with me.<br/><br/>Overall, utility is good, boot time is top notch, and half the price of Apple's air book. Worth the trade off.
The product is incredible, good value for the money, perfect build quality, awesome display and battery life.<br/>Awesome job by Asus.<br/>With occasional failure of display driver, the product is unmatched by any laptops in this price range. I think it's one of the best out if not the best.<br/>Actually I'm quite fascinated why there are not much video reviews of this product ? It is certainly in the top 3, in my estimation .
Other than having to deal with Windows 8 (not ASUS' fault), I love this machine. Reminds me a lot of my MacBook Air I had to give up, except quieter (no fan). Screen size is plenty big enough to get work done, and serves up shows on Hulu just fine. I will say the speakers are not very loud and a little tinny, but I never expect anything from laptop speakers and use something else when I care about sound quality.
I had to return the first two I received. The first one appeared to have a bad processor or something. It ran extremely slowly and maxed out at 0.49Ghz. The second one locked up every hour or so. So far the third one is working. I use this laptop for my small business and it doesn't lag at all. It's perfectly snappy for using the internet and MS Office.
I bought this laptop to install Linux Mint. Thanks other people mentioned in their reviews that Mint works well on this one. Everything works fine except screen brightness control, I have to use "xrandr --output eDP1 --brightness N" (N from 0.4 to 1.0). Excellent quality for the price. Very lightweight, excellent travel companion. With Linux the battery life is between 4 and 5 hours, but I am developing software on it, so not a big surprise.<br/>My favourite laptop ever.
Great computer. Love every bit of it, except the touch pad is loud and not very good. Even just tapping it, it makes noise. As a solution, I put electrical tape along the bottom, which makes the mouse bottoms inoperable (Can still be used by touching and double touching, which is how I usually do it anyway.)
{UPDATE} After owning this laptop for a little over a week the hard-drive failed. I had also experienced some lockups and crashes from the beginning but thought it may just be some of the bloatware and/or apps misbehaving which I was beginning to uninstall. My battery life was also no were near 10 hours. The background light bleed was noticeable but I thought I could live with it. Idiotic hinge design as others have said that lifts the unit off the desk when opened.<br/><br/>I am an IT Professional, and prior to this experience, a long time ASUS product enthusiast. Called tech support and after confirming my diagnosis the support guy told me my only options were to return it to Amazon or ship it to ASUS and have them repair it and send it back which would take approximately 7-10 business days after they received it. SERIOUSLY!?! - You gotta be kidding me. I just lost any data I didn't have backed up to the cloud and many hours installing programs, moving data, and customizing this thing. When the laptop died and I called tech support I was upset but I fully expected hear "We apologize and assure you this is a rare occurrence Sir. A new unit will be expedited to you overnight. Please pack the defective one and ship it back us at your earliest convenience". Any and every company can and will put out a few lemons but the way you take care of the poor guy who got stuck with one is how you retain customers and your reputation.To top it off, I just filed for return with Amazon and now it only shows that it is available from a 3rd party with an inflated price tag. After calling tech support one more time and getting the response below I'm done with ASUS. I'll be looking at other Ultra-books to replace this. There is a reason the price is too good to be true.<br/><br/>According to Jeremy (level II tech support) at ASUS I did not buy a laptop from them. I bought it from Amazon! Way to take ownership of your product Jeremy. This is an all time low from my experience with customer service and standing behind your product.
has good quality, a handsom, quick machine. I had many problems with wi fi connectivity, still not completely solved.. another issue is with the display adapter, it crashed few times and the screen is sometimes stretched until I refresh it. otherwise a perfect machine for my needs
I purchased an ASUS laptop back in 2009  mainly because it was one of the first laptops to offer a discrete graphics card, this was well before intel graphics were decent. I utterly hated the laptop, the screen quality was poor, the chassis construction was lacking, and it was very expensive. Since that purchase I've consciously avoided purchasing an ASUS laptop. Well, this has changed since my purchase of ASUS Zenbook UX305. The most important aspects for me in purchasing the Zenbook UX305 was the reported screen specifications, the weight, and price. This laptop is outstanding, here are my pros and cons:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Beautiful full HD IPS screen<br/>Silent when operating (fan-less design)<br/>Extremely thin and light weight (2.3 lbs)<br/>5-6 hours of battery life under regular use<br/>Amazing price tag ($570 with rebate)<br/>Sturdy and well built chassis<br/>Large and responsive touchpad<br/>Tactile chiclet style keyboard<br/>240 SSD<br/>8 GB of RAM<br/>3  USB 3.0 ports<br/>Small and portable AC adapter<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Windows 8.1 (easy to upgrade to Windows 10 though!)<br/>Keyboard not backlit<br/>No HDMI port (Mini-HDMI port instead)<br/>Inserted SD card significantly protrudes.<br/>Power button is on the keyboard next to the delete button<br/>Chassis can develop hot spots.<br/><br/>I don't think you can buy a better ultra portable laptop at this price point. This computer is absolutely perfect for anyone who needs portable, responsive, and well built laptop. The only aspect which I think will depend on the type of work you intended to use it for  is the processor. This laptop moves away from traditional core i3/i5 for a mobile like processor, MY510 which has a base clock speed of 0.8 GHz ( turbo boost 2.0 GHz). Only occasionally have I found that this processor is inadequate such as serious multitasking.<br/><br/>On Windows 10: The upgrade to Windows 10 was seamless, everything works as intended.<br/><br/>On Ubuntu  I'm more of a Linux user than Windows, so after upgrading to Windows 10 I moved onto Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS.  The installation was simple and straightforward. Almost everything works out of the box; the only thing that does not is the screen brightness function keys. I'm getting about 5-6 hours of use on the battery. I have also noticed that multitasking in Ubuntu is much more effective than in Windows on this processor. I  can have GIMP, Chrome, and a Youtube open all at the same time with little bogging down of the system.
I bought this as a replacement for a 2010 MacBook Air, and with the intention of running Linux on it.  For the price point, it has delivered fabulously.<br/><br/>I'm using Ubuntu 14.04, and my experience has been roughly the same as Adam described in his review.  Most things work out of the box.  Notable exceptions are:<br/>1. The display brightness keys do not work and the display does not auto-dim.  This can be a battery sink if you're not careful.  Following Adam's tip I solved this by installing xbacklight and mapping the controls to alt+f6/f6.<br/>2. I cannot figure out how to properly connect to my employer's wifi due to a certificate problem.  I get stuck in an infinite loop where I'm continuously prompted to enter my password.  Googling online reveals that this problem is not unusual.  I have not had trouble with other wifi networks (coffeeshops/hotels/my home network all work fine).<br/>3. Sometimes text display gets garbled.  This happens to all text on the screen (e.g. text boxes in applications as well as terminal windows).  I have always been able to fix it either by resizing the window or rebooting the machine.<br/><br/>The performance of the machine is exceptional for the price.  The screen looks great.  The SSD works beautifully.  With 8gb of ram it handles multitasking well.  One very minor complaint is that the processor does not run computationally intensive programs as smoothly as the five-year-old MacBook Air this is replacing.  Mathematica notebooks, for instance, are notably slower to run on this machine than my old Air.  But this is a minor inconvenience because for intensive Mathematica work its best to use a desktop anyway.<br/><br/>Probably my biggest complaint has to do with the power cord.  Unlike Apple cords, the prongs that go into the wall socket do not collapse, and there are no spokes that can be propped out from the adapter to wrap the cable around.  This makes it bulky in a briefcase.  Additionally, the male end that plugs into the laptop itself is an old-timey power connection that inserts well into the body of the laptop.  Tripping on the cable might destroy the computer.  It's a big step down from modern magnetized Apple power cords.  But, on the other hand, this computer is $400ish dollars cheaper.
Pros:<br/>1.Thinness and weight. This thing isn't much heavier than carrying an actual notebook around. The kind with paper in them. I slide it into my computer bag, and secure it with the velcro strap and almost feels like the bag is empty. Everyone I've shown this too has marveled at its slim design.<br/><br/>2. Great keyboard. As an author, this was extremely important to me. I can type on this all day long! I make fewer typos too. Always a plus, and when I do make an error, it's not a stretch to the backspace key to fix it. A lighted one would be nice though, but there are decent sized raised ridges on the J and F keys making it easy to feel where my hands are.<br/><br/>3. It's so much faster than the Acer Sleekbook I bought just three months before I bought this. Like night and day.<br/><br/>4. It looks fantastic. I know, shouldn't really matter as looks don't help performance, but let's face it, looks do matter.<br/><br/>5. Price--this is an outstanding laptop for the price. It looks, feels and performs like a premium computer, but costs hundreds less.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>1. the power pin could fit in more securely. Mine seems to be a little loose in when it's seating in the housing. (hole? whatever you call it where you plug it in to the computer.)<br/><br/>2. I've had a few brief display driver fails. They fixed themselves each time, but it's startling when it does it, and makes me a bit nervous. I'm hoping there will be some kind of fix for that in an update.
Computer itself is fine, however Amazon's description is wrong. Item described as Titanium Gold, it was distinctly Rose Gold. Fine if you're after that color, but unless you like touting around a pink computer, I'd stay away.
I picked up this laptop for college and LOVE it.<br/><br/>I have had the laptop for 2 weeks.  Within 20 minutes of taking the laptop out of the box, I started the process of upgrading to Windows 10.  I use OneNote for note taking for class.  My old laptop weighed 7 lbs and the battery lasted a paltry 30 minutes.  This laptop is very light weight and the battery last all day for classes.  The virtual desktops for windows 10 is VERY helpful given the screen size.  I can quickly multitask between class and personal desktops (when I get a few extra minutes before class starts).<br/><br/>When deciding on this laptop weight, battery life, and price were my leading factors.  I am super pleased with the purchase and have talked about it with classmates that are also going asus.  Buy with confidence.  I went with the Core M series and am glad I did not pick up the i5.  After researching both, I liked the longer battery life on the Core M.  This laptop is not a touchscreen, which I wont miss the fingerprints.  The screen is matte, so direct lighting from the rear isn't an issue.  Solid little laptop.
Every other reviewer has already mentioned the good stuff. Great display with high brightness and matte finish for a great viewing experience. Long battery life due to low energy use of the M processor. Has enough power for daily work and school, plus some Minecraft on the side. Thin, light, and sleek.<br/><br/>My issues are as follows:<br/>The ASUS customized Intel 5300 graphics driver. A couple tech reviewers mentioned their issues with it as well. Basically the driver crashes, causing a temporary black screen, and then it starts working again. There are no updates available from ASUS at the moment to correct the issue.<br/><br/>Sometimes when in desktop mode the pc will suddenly swap into metro mode. Don't know why.<br/><br/>I keep setting the power option to "balanced" and after a while it swaps on its own to "high performance". can't seem to fix that either.<br/><br/>It is a fingerprint magnet.<br/><br/>I'm a little worried that the hinge opens too easily already. Hopefully it is just a light opening hinge and won't loosen up any more over time.<br/><br/>So why four stars with all these issues? Because it's still a great laptop . To get this much tech, design, and performance for this price is hard to beat. This is the third laptop I've tried this month and it's the one I'm keeping.<br/><br/>If ASUS gets the driver fixed I'd give it five stars because it'd be as close to perfect for me and my use as you can get. Hopefully the software gets fixed soon.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I've performed a clean boot of the computer to attempt to tea k down the issues I was having. It seems I disabled something that may have been affecting my power settings and the randomly switching back to the metro display. The computer has retained my power setting choices and has not swapped over to metro on its own since enabling all the startup and service options again. Not sure which might have been the culprit.<br/><br/>I deleted the ASUS graphics driver after downloading a newer version from Intel's website. ASUS recommended using the generic driver in an online chat with tech support. After removing the old driver and using the Intel one, I've only had one display driver crash while on low battery power during a game of minecraft with about 7 internet explorer Windows open. By comparison, the driver used to crash three or more times per use. So far everything is operating fine and I'll update this info if anything changes.<br/><br/>The Bluetooth settings menu won't open sometimes and there are a couple quirks to connecting it with my JBL Flip. If already in a game I won't be able to have the Flip perform sound duty. If I start the Flip prior to game entry, it works fine. Swapped over just fine on Spotify, so it may be an issue in the game software itself and not the computer.<br/><br/>For now, it's still a solid 4.
This laptop is super thin and very light. It is also very, very quiet. It boots up within seconds and seems to very fast when surfing the Internet and watching video clips. The On/Off switch is located at the top right row on the keyboard, a bit odd at first, but I really like it. Battery life is very good. It takes about 3 hours to fully charge it and then it lasts for 8-9 hours. Wi-fi setup was very easy! In fact, the entire set-up was completed in less than 5 minutes with no headaches. The screen is very bright and vibrant right out of the box - I had to tweak the settings a bit to tone down the brightness.<br/><br/>Just a few negative aspects - the touch pad is annoying, very sensitive and difficult to perform a right-click. I could not see a difference in using the left or right side and got so annoyed with it that I am using a mouse. The keyboard does NOT have a backlight. The case is attractive but easily shows fingerprints. Windows 8.1 is also a pain and takes some getting used to. Aside from that, this is a great laptop.
I purchased this laptop for $749.99 but the price went down to $714.99 and again to $699.99 within 8 days. Amazon was great about refunding me the difference in price and I have been using this laptop nonstop since I received it. I was using a 2011 huge 15.6-in Toshiba before this and the difference is amazing.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-lightweight<br/>-thin<br/>-battery life (doesn't last me 12 hrs every single time, but lasts a good 10 hrs)<br/>-matte screen<br/>-windows 10!<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-keyboard needs to be pressed down a bit more than I'm used to.<br/>-doesn't have a home or end button for when scrolling down long pages or documents<br/><br/>So far, it's been about 2 weeks and I'm loving this laptop. The keyboard "con" I listed above was annoying for the first hour or so but it's so small of an issue that it doesn't affect my opinion about this laptop. It's incredibly fast, light, and long lasting. I will be bringing it overseas on vacation in 3 weeks and hope it keeps performing the way it has.
Get ready, because you're about to knock your pretentious MacBook owning friends down a notch.<br/><br/>I spent months shopping around before deciding on the Zenbook, and I'm here to tell you this is absolutely the best value of any laptop on the market today. I looked at every option imaginable, including the MacBook Pro and the higher end Ultrabooks, and this is absolutely the best option for the money. This has all of the internal features that a $1200+ laptop has, and absolutely nails all of the important aspects with the 8GB of RAM and a 256 GB SSD (which, unless you are trying to store the Library of Congress on your laptop, is plenty of space). It omits things such as a touchscreen and a backlit keyboard in order to keep the price down and still offer top notch internal specs and build quality, which for me, are things that fit into the category of "cool" but don't improve the computing experience. The screen is beautiful and the matte finish is such a nice touch. The body is slim, lightweight, and just sexy. No way around it.  The core M processor is fantastic, and is going to be a very common place going forward.<br/><br/>I can't say enough about this computer. Having nearly the exact specs of a $1499 MacBook Pro, at $699 this is highway robbery. Quit shopping.
This laptop is a fantastic ultra-portable device for casual use. I can take it out with me for the whole day without worrying about it running out of battery (about 7 hours SOT). For ASUS' first shot with the intel core m series CPU, they really seemed to have proven that this laptop is the best bang for your buck! While it's not perfect, I like it much more than other ultra portables with gimped RAM or tiny SSD's. Here's some of the things I would like to share about my experience with it so far:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Great Battery Life<br/>- Good for outside use (bright backlight and anti-glare screen)<br/>- 8gb RAM should be a minimum standard these days, thanks ASUS.<br/>- Decent travel for keys so short<br/>- 256gb SSD on the BASE model, bravo ASUS.<br/>- 3 USB ports<br/>- fanless, so no noise whatsoever<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- track pad is usable, but not as responsive as I'd like<br/>- gets hot on cloth surfaces<br/>- a lot of annoying ASUS bloat preinstalled<br/>- no backlit keys
My girlfriend and I decided to be cute and get the same laptop. But I am poor so I bought a Like-New condition to save some money because the description said that it is all in original packaging. The laptop came extremely dirty and had scratches all over it. I do not know who amazon-certified inspector that "certified" this laptop but the condition is less than good and definitely not "like-new" which cost a lot more than "good".<br/><br/>I did however get to use my girlfriends laptop and for the price you are paying it is an incredibly good laptop. So if you are used to a 15.6" Toshiba Satellite with a bigass speaker then you will notice that this Bang and Olufsen is not quite as loud but the sound was clear. If you compare this zenbook to a macbook air, you will notice that the zenbook is a relatively high and thickness as compared to the mac which tapers down sharply. Also if you are used to the sensitive keys of a mac keyboard, you will not like the zenbook's keyboard as it misses keys that I know that I pressed. I sit here typing on my macbook air so that tells you what I choose in the end. Overall the specs are twice as good as the air but the keyboard plus amazon selling me a fair condition laptop verses the like-new brings the review down. Not a deal breaker but no backlit keyboard for those of you who like that feature. You need to pay like $100 more for the higher end zenbook for that. To Amazon's credit, they are offering me a full refund.
This laptop is fast. I like how lightweight it is. Even though it is lightweight, the computer's body still feels sturdy. Although it is fan less, it does not over heat. No Microsoft word. If you want to update your resume, you'll have to dish out $8 a month for Microsoft office (which is outrageous). One problem I had with this laptop was that it would crash while watching youtube videos on google chrome. This issue has been resolved. I guess an update fixed it. Does it really last 10 hours on a full charge? It's more like 7,8 hours . One thing that really sucks about this laptop is the extremely low speakers. I always use headphones so this doesn't affect me much, but anyone without headphones will be frustrated. 1080p videos stream flawlessly on my 25mbps internet. The display is beautiful.  The touchpad is alright, but the right and left button are so rigid and loud clicking. This computer shuts down and boots up within a matter of seconds.
Pros: light weight, excellent display in matte finish, quiet, did I mention that it's light?<br/><br/>Cons: runs hot ... hot enough that I seriously considered returning the laptop since I would be using it while traveling and the heat is quite noticeable when it's actually on my LAP; even at full volume, sound is not very robust; no integrated LAN connection; windows 8.1 (need I say more?)<br/><br/>Other Thoughts: Unit feels well-constructed and solid. The thing is a featherweight while providing a screen that's easy to work on with business applications. I really TRIED using Windows 8.1 but I just hated it. Classic shell has been my savior, and I will download Windows 10 (probably with Classic shell for that as well) for this unit. Wireless speeds seem fine, haven't noticed any serious lag in speed with the Core M processor (but doing mostly business work and light streaming with Netflix).
I purchased this laptop a couple of weeks ago and love it.  It came preloaded with Windows 10 - a huge upgrade from the clunkiness of Windows 8.1.  The system runs great.  It's fast, makes multitasking easy, and quickly runs various applications without any delay whatsoever.  The one issue I have had and I have heard this is due to a need to upgrade firmware for W10, is the display driver dropping every now and again and then resetting.  It's happened only a few times and often when  the battery is low and the system is being overworked.  Otherwise, a great purchase.  Not sure what people are talking about when they refer to the issues with the mousepad and clicker - I don't have that problem and am glad I took the plunge to buy despite my reservations about the pad module.  Super light, fast, versatile, and packable.  Best bang for your buck for sure.
This is a four cylinder Toyota Corolla. It is well made, simple, competent and very fuel efficient. It is well suited to business travellers who need a small, cheap fully functional Windows laptop that runs a very long time untethered.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>Incredibly thin---easily slides behind the magazines in an airplane seat back pocket and easily slides into luggage or briefcases.<br/>Incredibly light<br/>Runs cool<br/>Runs LONG---very long<br/>Solid construction<br/>Attractive<br/>SSD---super fast boots<br/>Nice feeling keys<br/>Nice screen<br/>Low price<br/><br/>CONS<br/>Touchpad is weird and easily triggered while typing<br/>Slower performance---this is not a fast computer (but perfectly adequate for business tasks)<br/>No touchscreen<br/>Speakers are underpowered but adequate<br/>Small hard drive<br/><br/>Caveats: This is not a machine made for games or rendering. It can handle basic video tasks competently but that is it.
This laptop is bottom line fantastic for the price. I thought that the processor could be a little less than I would like but it is plenty quick when surfing the web and navigating through your software. The only slight annoying problem I have noticed is that my graphics card encounters a problem. When this happens, my screen goes black with only the mouse showing for about 3 seconds then everything comes back and a message states that the graphics card encountered an error but has fixed itself. It does no damage to the computer or anything which is running at the time, but it can be annoying. I would say this happens once every few days.<br/><br/>Other than that, this laptop is great and if you are looking for a computer in the $500-1000 range, this should be your selection. I am happy I chose this over the Windows Surface 2/3
Overall very pleased. A few complaints:<br/>-the laptop is not grey, it is a greyish purple color<br/>-when flipped open the bottom of the top screen rests on the table, not the studs designed for it to rest on<br/>- you need to be used to a matte screen, its nice once you get used to it but makes the screen seem a little weird at first<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-very light, amazingly slim and feels sturdy for its size<br/>-it has a feature that allows it to start up in about 5 seconds<br/>(also if you buy it on Microsoft you get the windows 10 already installed on it for you)<br/>really great buy for the price, I couldn't find anything else with these specs at this price, now we'll just have to wait and see how it holds up on the long term!<br/>- clear screen
This is a very good quality laptop for the price.  I have been using it a lot over the past week and can share the following:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>- lightweight and portable<br/>- the aluminum case is very appealing and rivals the Mac Pro<br/>- the keyboard is well laid out and responsive<br/>- performance is great for desktop apps (word processing, software development, web browsing)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>- no slot for a tethering cable<br/>- not a touch screen (which likely allowed them to go higher end on other components though)<br/>- track pad is OK but not as responsive as that on a Mac<br/>- screen resolution is good but the 4k models coming out now blow it away for only a little more money<br/>- no back lit keyboard
This laptop has everything I need as a student. It runs Windows 10 flawlessly, it has a great 1080p screen, it opens all microsoft office products without hesitation, it has a long battery life, it transports easily, and most importantly- I can run 10 chrome tabs without slowing down. I purchased this laptop for the looks, and it ended up being better than I had anticipated. I thought the processor would be slow, but if you're not rendering or playing games, it doesn't hesitate. The 8gb of ram is quick, and the SSD drive is stellar. It gets a bit warm but I've never been uncomfortable with it in my lap. Also, the keys allow me to breeze through school papers and patient notes.<br/><br/>For 700, this laptop doesn't dissapoint.
Great affordable lightweight laptop. The display is just a notch below Apple's Retina at a fraction of the price. Processor and memory is more than adequate for my daily needs (I work online). I do have 1 complaint or it would have 5 not 4 stars.  The touch pad is mediocre at best and extremely annoying at worst. It often won't respond to a repeated tap or a click but other times a finger too close but not touching will generate a click. And forget about the pinch function unless you enjoy frustration getting something sized properly.  All things considered I'm happy with this machine after several weeks of use. But is is so difficult to make a responsive/consistent touch pad?!
Got one of these through work a week ago and I love it. It feels slightly lighter/ thinner than my coworker's macbook airs and almost as good of quality (all metal case) for half the price and on a windows platform. The solid state hard drive and 8 gigs make it great for normal internet browsing and office work. Only downside is it gets a little hot when you're doing heavy work/ video/ memory intensive work (there is no fan) but I've only noticed that once. If you are memory intensive - you may want to add on 4gb more. Not sure how windows 10 will deal with memory (hopefully better than windows 7/8 that takes like 3gbs of your memory doing nothing). Highly recommend.
Good laptop, its fast, I was able to play Raimbo Six Siege 6 Beta whith lowest settings at 60fps, Hard Drive is ok, keyboard feels good, the trackpad i have not using it because i bought a wireless mouse at the same time i bought the computer, overall is a great product and is ecelent for traveling and moving around, cloded it is exaclty the same height as a macbook pro 15 , so it is very thin. I would recommend everyone to buy this product, core i5 with 8gb and 256ssd is a great config that you will not get at this price, about the color there have been many questions, the color its like the colour of makeup rubor, but it doesnt look girly at all if you are a man.
The screen flexes a lot more than the Mac.  Updated to W10 without any trouble. It required a BIOS update, (which is probably beyond the scope of  the novice user)  to get the trackpad to work like a Mac ( ie. multi-finger gestures).<br/><br/>Battery life is pretty good, given the high efficiency Intel Core-M (15W) CPU, and the SSD.  The default configuration w 8G RAM and 250G SSD makes a lot of sense. A similarly configured Macbook Air would set you back about double the money.<br/><br/>The Titanium Gold edition is now available for an extra $70. (A tiny bit heavier)<br/>Imo it is well worth the extra money (you get a faster, i5 5200 CPU, and 802.11ac instead of N).
I liked this computer. It was very fast, lightweight, looked nice. The screen was never that great though and then the major issues revealed themselves when I plugged in my extra monitor to the HDMI port. The text on my external monitor was very fuzzy, to the point that my eyes were starting to ache when I would try to read anything. So I tested this on another monitor with a different cable, same thing. Once I started Googling a bit I found this is a common issue. You can send it back for a replacement and hope that you will get one that works properly, but that becomes a hassle after a while so I'm going the refund route.
This is my favorite thing I own!  Really the only laptop I could take from work to home every day.  I have nothing but love for the functionality of this laptop - the only minor issue I have is that even with speakers at their maximum the volume is quite low.  You won't regret this purchase for portability, functionality, and aesthetics.
The ASUS Zenbook UX305LA is an outstanding small laptop; it was good with Windows 10, but even better once I installed Windows 7 Home Premium. I wouldn't recommend it for hardcore gaming, video editing, or scientific computing, but for day to day uses such as email, web browsing, office work, and media playing, it really is a solid performer.
Does anyone else have serious issues with this computer connecting to wireless routers? I want to like this computer but it won't connect with half of the wireless networks I come across. I'm very close to sending it back after wasting hours of my life trying to fix it with no answers found on any of the support forums
THE GOOD: 1.good I.D. and looks pretty 2.solid performance 3.good price 4.thin/light<br/>THE BAD:1.the win10's FHD. Some software's windows too large, some too small, looks very strange and uncomfortable 2.the sd card is out of the port 3.the edge<br/>One word, it's worth waiting, but win10 can do better in high resolution.
Great product. The ultrabook is really well designed and it's light and comfortable to handle and use. It has a good build quality too. The battery time is about 6 hrs as stated in the description. I don't have any objections about this product, it's really worth it for the price tag.
Broke twice within the first 60 days.  Problem with the battery interface with the charging cord.  Needs to be shipped back to ASUS, and I will be buying my college student a replacement since she can't wait three weeks on the repair.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.
Insane fast start up, great power through running and starting programs, and very lightweight yet durable and solid feeling. I guess the only thing I would change is how many fingerprints there are on the top but that's literally nothing compared to the rest of the pros. *****
I am using the ASUS to create this review. First class machine - excellent screen; nice keyboard; fast enough for anything you probably need it for and wonderfully slim. Only upgrade I would like would be a back lit keyboard.<br/><br/>1/2 the price of an equivalent MacBook.
I simply love this laptop, feels high quality just like a macbook. Windows 10 runs fast and this laptop is so beautiful.  The trackpad and audio is not great but works ok. The cpu runs everything fast , and boot time is like 5 secods.... buy this laptop!
I really like this small laptop.  While it has some caveats, the positives far out weight them.  This is a powerful i5 laptop that is small, very light, has a very good screen, great battery life, and has a nice look to it.  I usually don't get random positive compliments on whatever laptop I use in public, I have with this Asus.<br/><br/>Nice things with these small, super thing ultra laptops is that they don't generate much heat and are very quite.  A re-occurring nightmare with my current larger laptop is that I drop it on the couch onto a blanket and it blocks the fan port and it overheats very very fast.  This laptop has ports on bottom I assume for air and the speakers.  I've yet to feel it get hot.<br/><br/>I mainly am using this laptop as a to-go machine and use it to surf, emails, small writing projects and so on.  No heavy duty work.  As such, the i5 processor is more than powerful enough for me.  Overall... there is a lot to like with this laptop!<br/><br/>On critical side of things...<br/>I've seen noted repeatedly in the comments criticism for not having a back-lit keyboard, and I strongly agree with that point.  Having such a small portable laptop is a little bit of a game changer in that I take it places that I would not bother with my larger laptop.  As such, there are now more opportunities for me to be in poorly lit locations and the back-lit keyboard (very lightly back-lit, not a neon sign) becomes needed functionality.<br/><br/>I am enthusiastic at all regarding the speakers with this Asus laptop.  They are barely adequate.  I'm not looking for drivers to make the laptop vibrate, but come on, some more volume is needed to overcome background noise.  This issue goes back to the earliest days of computers, lackluster speakers.  The quality of the sound is ok in a silent room but beyond that, lacking.  This really needs to be fixed.<br/><br/>There you have it... pros and cons.  The pros far outweigh the cons.  This is a fantastic little laptop!
from a beginners point of view, mostly interested in internet searches and communication, I bought this on the strength of more experienced computer users' reviews. my last computer was a 2010 sony vaio that weighed 6 lbs. and had a flimsy plastic outer top. it's battery lasted about 90 minutes max. 15.5 inch screen.<br/>By comparison, this Zenbook is like changing from video cassette to dvd. Everything is as good or better than the reviews , so I will not rehash what others already wrote.<br/>Here are a few useful bits of information.<br/>The aluminum shell is a big plus, gives it a solid feel and the hinge is smooth and strong. you can lift it by the screen half without any problem.<br/>The screen half is very slightly bigger than the body at the front corners, a shark nose style and for first time users, that is how to open it. Put a finger under the two front corners and lift.<br/>My Zenbook came with Windows 8.1 and I immediately used the linked upgrade to Windows 10. This took almost 3 hours. The battery came partly charged but I let it run completely down before charging it fully. I did this twice even though some said this " memory " charging was not necessary. Old habits die hard. Anyway my point is that you should not expect to put it to use immediately out of the box.<br/>The online instructions were not much use because they were for windows 8.1. I bought a guide to Windows 10, as I am new to it. Very easy and intuitive to use. Amazingly easy to e mail pictures etc.. I also changed the layout of the tiles on the start screen.<br/>One thing not covered in the instructions was how to page "home" and "end". You press function and the left or right arrow for this.<br/>For Windows 10 you have to create an e mail account in outlook. You can add other e mail accounts easily and have them all accessible from the same page.<br/>I found the McAfee pop ups very annoying. I uninstalled them , you can too by going to Settings>System>Apps and features, click on the program and uninstall.<br/>Windows 10 includes Windows Defender. I rely on this and not McAfee.<br/>A word of caution. I did pick up a malware tail while surfing and it was able to deactivate Windows Defender and this tail stayed on my top line and would not X out. However after uninstalling McAfee, the x out worked and Windows Defender came alive. Go figure.<br/>Please note. There is an ambient light sensor which is linked to the screen brightness. Indoors, I have found this to function contra to my expectations .<br/>Last point. Here is a tip for anyone setting up a product like Chromecast which is Google based. Rather than use room on my Zenbook and download Google, I used my smartphone instead. Now I can watch Netflix on my TV direct from my wi fi modem and my Zenbook is no longer tethered to the TV with a hdmi cable.<br/>Enjoy.
***** Update 11/28/2015*****<br/>I've lowered my review to 3 stars from 5 because of a recurring problem with the touchpad. A touchpad is such an important part of a laptop that it not working well deserves such a demotion.<br/><br/>The issue is with the driver for Windows 10. ASUS has its own driver and application called ASUS Smart Gesture. This does things like enabling two finger scrolling and swiping in from left and right. However when it is enabled, the mouse will often just freeze. You can disable it but it get re-enabled upon rebooting. You can remove it entirely, but it will get automatically reinstalled the next Windows Update cycle. Searching the web shows this is a fairly common problem and that the Windows 8.1 drivers would work well but they also get replaced by the newer and non-working ASUS driver.<br/><br/>Without a touchpad, it is hard to remedy the problem. If you have a USB mouse, you can plug that in and go to remove programs and remove Smart Gesture. Without a mouse you can also do it by tabbing/typing, but that is a bit trickier.<br/><br/>It remains a great laptop except for this one critical issue. When ASUS fixes it, it will go back to 5 stars.<br/>********<br/>This is a wonderful laptop with a great form factor, excellent screen, great performance, and decent keyboard. There are a few things lacking you might want to consider.<br/><br/>The good (and these are very good!)<br/>- All around fast. The SSD and i5 make sure you aren't waiting for anything. We're using this in a business environment (document creation, spreadsheets, web browsing) and also at home (videos, more web surfing, email) and it is great.<br/>- The screen is absolutely great! It puts our other laptops to shame. Viewable at just about every angle and rich colors. It almost looks like a photograph.<br/>- The SSD is 256 GB. The problem with SSDs had always been they were so much smaller. 128 was great for a while be we were outgrowing that. 256 GB means we can put space issues out of our minds for a very long time.<br/>- The trackpad works very well.<br/><br/>The OK<br/>- The keyboard is fine but It isn't anything special. It isn't lighted. No complaints per se.<br/>- The screen is full HD, which can be too high in some cases for a 13.3" screen. Fonts and icons are sized in pixels, so more pixels (full HD) on a small screen (13.3" diagonal) mean text and icons can be too small, depending on your eyesight. Windows lets you size things to 125% or 150%; we found the first a bit too small and the second a bit too large (fitting too few items on the desktop). This depends on your preference. But for pictures, HD video, word processing, and excel, the full HD look absolutely great, so well worth the tradeoff.<br/>- The power cord is a wall wart that plugs directly into the wall. It is a it is square (like an old Roku players or the Apple laptop chargers). The plug on the unit is offset so it doesn't block the other port of a standard electric receptacle, but it is still a bit large. The alternative, which most have, is a standard AC plug going to the power brick. That can be bulkier. This isn't a bad thing, just know it will require some room around the receptacle and will stick out about 3 or 4 inches.<br/>- No touch screen. Not awful, just know this and consider if you need it. You likely don't, but other people who have one will be touching your screen.<br/><br/>The Bad (nothing major)<br/>- The power key is part of the keyboard and next to the delete key in the upper right. Very easy to hit by accident, shutting down or putting the computer to sleep. We use the menus to shut down the laptop, so I disabled the power button in Windows (search for "change what closing the lid does", go there and change the power button to "Do Nothing").<br/>- There are a fair number of programs preinstalled. I installed just about all of them, which took some time. McAffee virus I left just to try it. ASUS has some stuff running in the background checking for updates, which I also left, but I don't know the value of this since Windows does this automatically. I typically give the manufacturer software a try hoping it knows a bit more about the hardware than Windows might, but the other stuff must go. Will likely uninstall McAfee when the free trial expires.<br/><br/>About Windows 10:<br/>I'm not reviewing Windows 10, but will say it works well in this laptop. We like the interface and is one of the reasons we don't miss a touch screen. There is only one complaint and that is the browser, Edge. It is fast and great, except it doesn't have add blocking so some web pages take forever to load as the adds are being loaded. Use your browser of choice instead and you'll be fine. We use Internet Explorer which you can find by searching and then pin to start and taskbar. Turn on Tracking Protection, select a few services, and things are much better. Eventually Edge will get this I hope, but for now consider your options. I also use a different PDF reader (Foxit Reader) because PDFs in the browser are inconvenient.<br/><br/>Another tip: Changing the default program can be a bit temperamental; for example, when opening Foxit Reader it will ask if to make that the default program. Say yes, but it doesn't happen. I don't think it has permission to do that. So go to "default program" and try it there. It may or may not work!. What does work (and it worked for both Foxit Reader and changing to IE from Edge) is to right click on a file, choose "Open with" and then "More Options". Find the program and make sure "use this app for all files" is checked.
My needs were for a travel PC with a 1080 screen.  My i7 laptop is nice, but is nice and heavy too.<br/>I was not looking forward to hauling it around.  The ASUS is a feather by comparison.<br/><br/>With the Dell XPS-13 (2015) it was $100 to get an i5, $100 to get 8 Gb of RAM, $100 to get 256 Gb of storage.<br/>This is now $1099, $400 more than the ASUS.  Paying 40% more for 12 to 15% more speed was not the need.<br/><br/>The Core M is not as fast as the i5 and has the 5300 graphics instead of 5500, but still does a good job for most business tasks.<br/>The lack of backlight on the keyboard is a drawback. If I lived on an airplane I would be tempted to find the $400 for the Dell.  If this was to be a primary PC then the decision would move to the Dell or a Lenovo X1 Thinkpad.<br/><br/>For the type of use it will get, The ASUS was a bargain.<br/><br/>Update:<br/><br/>After traveling for two weeks with the UX305, it performed mainly as expected.<br/>The trackpad buttons are somewhat clunky, so I normally just tap the pad.  This usually works, but I find myself developing a habit of hammering the pad or double tapping, just to make sure the click works.<br/>There were times when a backlit keyboard were missed, but it was not a deal breaker.<br/><br/>Video performance was consistent, as were individual office applications.  If this is all you need it will provide acceptable performance.<br/>The thin light form was a joy to travel with and the adapter worked fine on 120/240V<br/><br/>Multitasking is not a strong suit and if some windows task is hungry it can bring the PC to its knees until it passes.<br/>Make sure you do your windows updates in advance as the PC will be in la la land for over half an hour with "Do not turn off your computer"<br/><br/>The first observation still stands.  If this was to be my main PC it would be on the weak side, but for casual travel it met the need.
This is my first ultra-book and I am extremely pleased with its performance and build.<br/><br/>Everything else about this laptop is first rate.  Battery life is excellent.  Startup time with the Solid State Drive is excellent.  Before I bogged it down with Antivirus and Anti Malware software startup was around 10 or 12 seconds.  The screen brightness and uniformity by eye are very good.  Keyboard is a personal thing, but I like the feel and layout and do not need backlighting.<br/><br/>I have run two very simple home brew benchmarks which time what I care about; number crunching speed (Matrix computations) and the results surprised me is a good way.  I compared against my 4 year old Dell XPS-8300 desktop which has an i7-2600 cpu  and a workstation laptop which is a Dell Precision M6800 with an i7-4810MQ.  The UX-305 was faster than the desktop by between 2 and 4 times while it was about half the speed of the workstation.  Keep in mind these are not general purpose benchmarks like Passmark.  I do not play video games and am NOT recommending this ultrabook for gaming.  In fact the Passmark scores for the i5Y10 is only 2834 compared with the i7-2600 which is 8271 and the i7-4810MQ (commonly used in gamer laptops I notice) is 8781.<br/><br/>I was expecting to use this ultrabook only for web browsing and typing documents, but it appears to be fast enough for hacking code and running somewhat compute intensive things.  This machine is a pleasure to use and exceeds my expectations, particularly at the $699 price point.
I was in the market for a new laptop after my old standby started to glitch out. I hadn't considered an Ultrabook (or Zenbook) laptop. I don't carry it often so the weight wasn't an issue. And I usually prefer larger screens. But after trying this I am blown away by how much I appreciate it!<br/><br/>PROs<br/>+ The small size and lightness actually do make this a better device. I hadn't ever considered using a laptop on my lap or at the couch or taking it with me until now. This is so light and so easy to move around that I love these features now. I didn't actually realize just how heavy my old laptop really was until I tried this.<br/>+ The specs on this make it one of the best deals I've seen. I've been putting together a PC that can handle gaming based on specs from PC Gamer and was looking at doing about $600 to $1200 depending on which level of piece. That wouldn't count the screen costs. This comes in at the low end of that price range but runs games really, really well. I connected my Steam account and started playing some of my favorites and I'm doing so on higher resolutions with all the graphic options selected. It's really sweet.<br/>+ I absolutely love booting from a solid state drive! I power on and in about 10 seconds I am fully up and running. This opens apps and programs instantly. The performance of this SSD has me looking at swapping out all my core drives on my PCs.<br/>+ The screen is small, but it looks terrific. It starts in 1920x1080 and looks great on games and videos.<br/><br/>CONs<br/>- As great as the screen looks, I think I would still prefer 15 or greater inch screens.<br/>- Windows 10 is much better than 8 or 8.1. But sometimes games or apps aren't yet ready for it. I was playing Civ V, for instance, and it hung. Instead of allowing me to crash to or switch to the desktop I had to power down. I think this is because of the drivers and this doesn't happen on Windows 8.1 devices I have. I couldn't even get the Windows key to push the app to a window. If this isn't Windows 10, it could be the hardware or configuration of the laptop. Either way, I'm hoping time and updates fix these rare glitches.<br/><br/>The amount of times I've had trouble with this machine is so few that I'm not going to take any marks off for it. Also, if you're shopping for a 13 inch screen the screen size of finding one shouldn't be a mark down either. I'm so impressed by this laptop that it has quickly become my default PC at home and my gaming PC as well. I recommend you get a Bluetooth mouse (I just tried Logitech's M535 and it connected and works great). I love this!
A Great Ultra book, super fast literally boots in 5 seconds, I had my doubts on the core M but can handle most things with ease,handles even streaming 1080p movies with ease so don't let the slow cpu speed turn you away, most laptop cpu's are overkill anyways. Reviews say it runs hot and has glitchy touch pad deff not the case in my opinion , the touch pad is just very responsive.the laptop Itself runs super quiet no noise at all doesn't even seem likes it on or running, solid build quality all aluminum case is really nice. The display doesn't wobble or anything like most displays do and the ips display is great. If you need just something to do web browsing,watch movies and do things like word,excel and access then this is for you. Some reviews say the wifi is slow and it was at first but after installing new drivers it got faster, which you should install the lastest drivers anyway when buying a new laptop. Chrome opens up faster than you can blink. Gaming wise it's deff not for that idk why you would wanna game on a fan-less 13 inch ultrabook anyway. Windows offers the same model it's just called ux305fa-usm1 same thing just doesn't come with all the bloatware and third party apps new laptops usually come with, which is the one i purchased. Battery life is about 6 hours on high performance power mode and 10 hours on power save depending on what your doing. The keyboard is solid myself personally i like the spaced out keys and don't care for the lack of a backlit, there are things called lamps. Overall you can't beat the price, at least not right now closest one is the dell xps13 for 200 bucks more. There's no perfect laptop out there but this one is pretty close.
Perfect. Very light, quick (didn't try gaming), enough connectors. Sleek design. Only 2 minus: sometime difficult to open and incapacity to change battery as it is integrated. But still 5* as it is part of the thin and light positive points!
I typically like Asus products, and this is no exception. It looks nice, is lightweight, and has a great display. With a 256 GB solid state hard drive and 8 GB of RAM, it is also very responsive, with quick start-up and resume times. Programs load very quickly as well, letting you spend more time doing and less time waiting.<br/><br/>There are 3 USB ports and a micro-HDMI port (not the standard size, so you might need a new cable to hook it up to your TV or monitor). While the computer lacks an ethernet jack, it did come with a USB-to-ethernet adapter in the box; you can connect with a wire via this adapter, but you will be using one of the USB ports to do so. There's also an SD card reader, if you are into that kind of thing :)<br/><br/>The keyboard and mouse have a good feel to them.<br/><br/>On to the bad...at first, the laptop felt slightly flimsy. I think that it was just the light weight and the thin form factor because that impression was fleeting. Also, when you open the lid to about 100 degrees (just past vertical), the lid itself starts to lift the back end of the laptop up off of the table/surface it was resting on; the lid rotates into a position where the back edge of the lid is now resting on the table and the back-bottom of the laptop is now elevated slightly off of the table. This doesn't effect the stability of the laptop at all, but it was off-putting the first several times that I noticed it happening.<br/><br/>For the price, you get a fast, responsive, lightweight laptop that occupies very little space in a backpack or bag.
I like everything about this laptop, but the 10 hour battery life is simply a lie. My Asus is brand new, but the battery  drains in about 4-5 hours. I don't even do high consumption things like video and sound.
It's a complete mac-air and macbook killer. at this price this beast destroys its competitors and then some. the screen isn't touchscreen which is kind of depressing but i mean its so cheap so what can you expect. 256gb was extremely surprising for this price range though, its one of the only few laptops that have such a massive ssd for this size and price. The Intel-M core is pretty weak in comparison to some laptops but it can easily handle everyday tasks and some minimal gaming on the side (i got like 100+fps on league of legends with everything on low settings, so fiddle around with it and you'll get the perfect mix for the 60hz IPS monitor, which is beautiful btw) but in the same sense, it can't run any complex games. Battery life probably isnt the 10 hours as advertised since windows drivers suck and the battery monitor is screwy like all laptops but I was able to play league for a decent 2 hours and then do some light music streaming and web surfing for another 2-3 hours (you will definitely hit that 10 hour mark if you mess around with the battery performance settings).<br/><br/>In terms of the external build, it is beautiful and sleek. in exchange for such awesomeness you have a fingerprint magnet haha. overall im pretty happy with this purchase to do my basic work.<br/><br/>**don't buy this if you're into hardcore gaming with programs needing dedicated gpus and multiple cpu cores :)
I am pleased with this laptop.  The light weight is great to carry.  I had reservations about Windows 8, but it is working for us.  It is very fast to respond.  The screen size is easy to view.
The Asus Zenbook features ultra portability for the active student or busy executive. A benefit of the Zenbook is the very quiet operation and lack of heat buildup due to not having physical drives, this also helps immensely with energy conservation allowing the Zenbook longer operating time between charges. With Windows 8.1 on a solid state drive, boot up and shutdown occur in mere seconds.<br/><br/>The left side features 2 USB 3.0 ports and an SD card slot. The right side features a headphone / microphone jack, micro HDMI, a 3rd USB 3.0, and a power jack. Like many new laptops, use the USB port to recharge a cell or tablet even when the laptop is powered off.<br/><br/>Ultra lightweight at barely a pound, super sleek, thinner than most tablets. Very responsive physical keyboard (far better than using a Bluetooth keyboard.)<br/><br/>The Zenbook is superb for surfing, watching videos, editing documents and spreadsheets, etc.  It suitable for editing audio tracks while it is moderately suitable for photo editing, light video editing, etc.  If you are into HEAVY graphics then I recommend the ASUS ROG series of laptops. Otherwise, the Zenbook should be ideal for most routine laptop usage.<br/><br/>Overall I am very impressed with the Zenbook and highly recommend it for especially the busiest of professionals or students.
I got the Core M version with a $100 rebate from a different store because I didn't want to wait one day for shipping, but first discovered it here on Amazon.<br/><br/>This laptop met all my needs and wants while excluding any unnecessary frills:<br/>1. Small and light<br/>2. Long battery life<br/>3. Strong performance (not for high end 3D gaming or other GPU-intensive tasks)<br/>4. Low-temperature and absolutely no hardware noise<br/>5. Affordable<br/><br/>I don't need super-performance, a touch screen, a back-lit keyboard, great speakers, or a bunch of different ports (my big, heavy laptop has all that). This awesome laptop cuts back on these things in order to give us all the things on my list above.<br/><br/>I can run Chrome with 20 open tabs, Visual Studio Enterprise 2015, Eclipse, Adobe Reader, Word 2016, and whatever else all at one time with no slow-down or heat. It gets a little warm, but it's never felt uncomfortably hot on my lap. The wifi is fine. I don't know exactly how long the battery actually lasts, but I can go more than a day with heavy usage without going below 30%. I haven't had any problems mentioned by other reviewers. Oh and it's really solidly built and beautiful. If I could I would marry this machine.<br/><br/>If your needs are similar to mine and you still aren't sure, just get this.
It's a great laptop. Only took 5 days to get here and I ordered on a Friday. Was surprised to notice that it wasn't a "plum"/"dark purple" sort of color everyone has been saying that it comes in instead of black...? I was actually kind of hoping it would come in that color, but no big deal, got Obsidian Black like it said i would.<br/>A little bit of a fault on my part but when i ordered it, i didn't even notice that it didnt come with a cd player! I even watched like 6 unboxing/review videos on YouTube.<br/>A great buy i think, i would definitely recommend this laptop for anyone in college or high school or just looking for an easy and great laptop.<br/>Don't worry, you won't regret it.<br/>UPDATE: I have had this computer for 5 days now and it is just acting weird. From day one it was doing this... (the two photos) where the icon for something would be slightly covering the word when you right click something such a iTunes. That was annoying, it still hasn't changed. Other stuff has been happening and it has been stressing me out, just small stuff though. I have to say i am a bit disappointed. I had high hopes for this computer when i bought it.<br/>It will be a good college computer, typing papers and such. I just wish it would perform correctly.
First Impression: Impressive packaging! Sleek and very light.<br/><br/>Pros so far (Purchased Recently): Very light, It's like adding a notebook to your backpack. Boots up quickly, it's not instant, but it's pretty darn close. Screen resolution is exactly what's advertised, and the keyboard isn't a weakness at all. I'm currently running windows 8.1, since there isn't much of an incentive to upgrade.<br/><br/>Cons so far: Touchpad is a bit too sensitive and either too swift or sluggish. It's not that big of a weakness, but a wireless mouse will probably be a fair investment. The laptop is sleek, but the screen doesn't seem as sturdy as one can imagine. Keep in mind, it might be designed that way to have that sleek feeling. Laptop also does look like it'll need to be cautiously moved, and it might be severely damaged if dropped, but hey which<br/>sleek laptop wouldn't?<br/><br/>Overall Review: Holy crap, this was not expensive at all for a laptop and it seems to do well so far. 4 stars seems like a fair rating with the only stumbles being the touchpad and screen strength.<br/><br/>Would I recommend? : Absolutely! You're getting a great bargain with that price! I've only had it for a couple of days, but I will continuously update this review for possible future buyers.
Overall laptop is quite OK.<br/>For me laptop stands out for good screen, good design and substantiation battery life (guaranteed more than 6 hours in economy mode which is OK for work, sometimes it reaches 10 hours depending on tasks)<br/>Still I have some questions as it is not the cheapest laptop and it should be really good.<br/>1) I really don't like sound. My smartphone's sound is much better than this - I don't know what to say  more.<br/>2) Touchpad drivers are really bad - when you scroll up or down and press ctrl afterwards it suddenly changes zoom on the page. It is incredibly annoying and I really don't like it.<br/>3) Power button is located near button 'del' and 'backspace'. Who designed the keyboard layout? What was in the head of this person? I ended turning of the power button to avoid accidental turning offs of my laptop<br/>4) There is no keyboard light. Quite poor for premium laptop.<br/>5) After 1 month of use the emerged a slack on one side of the body. You can hear 'clack' sound and feel that laptop body is not tightly tailored.<br/>6) And finally, there are frequent WiFi problems but I tend to blame Windows for this.<br/><br/>Finally, laptop is OK'ish but not perfect overall.<br/>But comparing to my previous Lenovo X1 Carbon (1st generation) it is really perfect so I never return to Lenovo-)
Great laptop,  Thin, lightweight and well made.  I was looking at the XPS 13 and ended up getting this one because it has more memory and storage at a much cheaper price.
This ASUS is amazing, it starts within seconds, loads things faster than my tower computer, and is great at connecting to wifi.<br/>Keyboard/Track pad<br/>The keyboard doesn't light up but I hardly ever notice since the screen lights up the keys enough anyways.The track pad will be a little slow and lagging at first, but after less than an hour of use it should be fine. Even though I hate track pads this one works very well and is better than most.<br/>Adapter<br/>It also comes with 2.0 USB Ethernet adapter, which works fine but is only a 2.0 so it's hardly any faster than wifi. It still helps with downloading large things but if you really want to boost your connection get a 3.0 adapter.<br/>Speakers<br/>Another thing is the speakers, while they're not super amazing they're probably the best built in laptop speakers around.<br/>Cons<br/>The one and only real downside is Windows 8, but with time you'll get to upgrade to Windows 10 so it's not that big of a deal. Another part I'm not a huge fan of is that it comes with McAfee as the security tool, but that's just my opinion.<br/>Buy it<br/>Still this is, overall, a great laptop and I would suggest it to anyone that wants a new laptop.
This laptop has a very sleek and smooth design. I very much enjoy the physical appearance. However, there a few minor flaws that caused me to dock a star.<br/>First, the airplane mode button on the laptop is backwards (on mine at least). When the light is on for a certain button, it usually means that that button is currently active. For example, when I press caps lock, the light for caps lock turns on to indicate that it's currently active. However, the key for airplane mode has an active light although it isn't active.<br/>Also, the battery life isn't as good as I expected. I can get roughly 4 hours or so when I'm not using any heavy/intensive programs or watching videos. It's decent, but definitely not the best I've seen.<br/><br/>Otherwise, this laptop is great in almost all other aspects. There are 3 USB 3.0 ports which come in very handy. I can use my phone charger's adaptive fast charging capability and it's compatible with the laptop. The laptop runs very smooth and just has a nice feel to it in general.
Trackpad sounds cheap but that doesn't bother me. Altogether a very nice and fast sleek notebook. Lightweight and perfect for my college life.
It's a good computer, a lot better than the one I used before. Super slim the battery is amazing, it's perfect for a college student like me.
Pros:<br/>- This is as slim and light as my Macbook Air, which is exactly what I needed!<br/>- Zippy, solid-state, cool-running, ultra portable<br/>- Outputs to my 4k like a dream<br/>- Really convenient, lightweight charging cable<br/>- Exactly the ports I need and nothing else<br/>- Powerful enough to do justice to many games without stuttering, which is so nice in an ultrabook.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Zero multitouch/scroll on the mousepad. That means that any time you want to scroll down a page with the touchpad, you need to navigate over to the window's scroll bar, and manually move it up/down. Very annoying. But I got around it with a multitouch-enabled Bluetooth mouse and the right drivers, so it's a problem solved.<br/>- The more graphically intense games will need to be toned down. (e.g. Don't Starve has no trouble, but Ark is a mess unless you cut everything down to minimal detail.)
I give it a "MEH".....I didn't by this because it was a power house but simple browsing, streaming media, and even iTunes just seems to be sluggish. I'm an Asus fan, have been since the mid 90's but this is a bit under powered. Win8.1 has the proc running at a steady 53% utilization right out of the box. The only apps I have installed are iTunes, Firefox, and Office 2010. Hard drive could be bigger too, most of my data is on a QNAP 450 Pro II and working with and opening files/documents is pretty sluggish, even when I copy the files locally and open them it's just a little off the mark as far as performance goes.<br/><br/>It will be interesting to see if Win10 works or is better. I will likely have to replace this with something with more juice.<br/><br/>Update, this is not a very good ultrabook, I should be able to run at least 2 programs without waiting to switch between screens..I may as well be back in the 90's.
I have to say, this is a sexy looking laptop.  It won't break any speed records, but it is super thin and light. Easy to carry.
This is the best computer I've ever had. Its all metal body give it an awesome premium feel, and the 8gb of ram and Intel m process make it super fast. 256 gb ssd that is blazing fast. All of this packed into a body that is 12 mm thick, and less than 3 pounds. It also boasts 10 hrs of batter life, and even though I have not gooten a full 10 hours it consistantly delivers 9 hrs without a problem. This laptop has all of the same specs as the new Mac book, while retaining a pricepoint of almost half of its apple counterpart.  Plus, with the free windows 10 upgrade, you get a great opperating system. The only draw back that I have noticed is the tiny speakers, but this is no problem because of the enhanced audio you get from Bang & Olufsen when you plug in a pair of headphones. All in all, this computer combines the portablilty and premium feel of the new Mac book, while retaining the compatibility of a pc.
This computer lives up to all the good reviews both on Amazon and online and my rating is more like a 4.5.  I feel the out of the box 'Balanced' power plan settings needed to be tweaked in order to get the CPU usage under control so it didn't run at 100% causing the laptop to get really hot.  This is because the laptop is a fanless design and logic exists to dial back CPU performance in order to lower the temperature when driving it hard causes excess heating (as opposed to traditional laptops that blow forced air over the CPU to cool it).  The changes I made were to the 'Intel Dynamic Platform and Thermal Framework Settings' when editing the advanced power plan options. I set the 'Config TDP Level' to 'Nominal', from the default 'High'.  I set the 'Power Limit' to 3.  Once I tweaked these the computer stayed much cooler under the same usage with no noticeable degradation in performance and experience.
Loved the design and how thin and light it is.  It performs amazingly well for the CPU in it on all fronts, including 1080p Youtube videos.  However, this unit didn't make it past 2 days before I found a quality control issue unfortunately.  The Micro-HDMI out the side did not work and after wiggling ever so slightly I was able to get it to work.  As if this wasn't bad enough, the screen turned permanently purple over all of the text as a result I'm sure of the HDMI issue.<br/><br/>I have attempted to change settings to fix this issue, reinstalled the Intel video drivers from Asus' website, and nothing fixed it.  This is not a setting issue but an internal hardware malfunction as you can see in my video.<br/><br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XoViRPIUqo
This is a nice and functional ultraportable for web browsing, microsoft office (not included), streaming video, ...  This is what I bought the laptop for so I am happy.  Have not tried to use the laptop for heavy duty stuff such as gaming, video conversion, ... so can't comment on that.<br/><br/>The touchpad driver needs to be updated for gestures to work properly.  Don't know why Asus did not have working driver installed.<br/><br/>After I updated the BIOS (210), the laptop could not find a boot drive to boot so it got stuck and bios screen.  Eventually, I found a youtube video "Asus Zenbook UX32A boot fix" and following the instruction to change three boot setting to get the laptop to boot.  This is totally inexcusable.<br/><br/>So the hardware is very good but the software is flawed (but easily corrected).
Though this computer looks lovely, mine has been plagued with problems since purchasing it six months ago. First, the power cord snapped (yes, snapped). Now, apparently the port is faulty and the computer won't charge. To fix my six month old computer, I have to send it to Asus, and will likely be without a computer for three to four weeks. Dealing with customer service was a nightmare. First, their system was down, and I was told to call back when they could actually process a repair order. Then, my call was disconnected repeatedly. No apologies for the inconvenience, no option to expedite the process, nothing. Save yourself the headache of dealing with this computer and this company and purchase a mac book, so atleast you have the option of going to Genius Bar. The extra money is worth it.
I was hesitant to buy another ASUS product, as I've had problems with their hardware before. Three months later I'm still ecstatic about my decision. I have the black, Core M, version.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>The Core M processor is surprisingly fast.<br/>Enough RAM for multitasking basic applications<br/>Core M, SSD, and integrated graphics chip mean no fans, no noise, and portability.<br/>Very light weight.<br/>Long battery life, 8 hours with intermittent use. It can sit for a day or two unused and still have some life left in it.<br/>Matte screen, which I prefer to the glare on more reflective screens. Also, smudges are not as visible on matte screens.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Keyboard is not back-lit. Which is mostly an inconvenience, somewhat remedied by using full brightness in the dark.<br/>It gets a little warm, especially sitting on your lap
This has everything I needed in a slim and compact package. Sleek and full of power and space. Highly recommended.
Have been a big fan of Asus since the beginning this is on awesome laptop would highly recommend.
Because of my job, I use to travel a lot, and 2 laptops on your shoulder (one for work, one personal).. mmm you better get a slim and light computer is you want to be comfortable. This computer is great for overall use, very fast, very light and thin! (did I mentioned is super light?), I'm a photography enthusiast so even Photoshop CC and Lightroom CC run nice and fast. Windows startup in 4 or 5 secs, office 2013 runs really smooth. Battery life is really good. What else can I say? if you need a light computer with great quality/performance/price ratio, don't look for more, this is the choice to go.
Excellent laptop. I was able to homegroup with my desktop PC very easily. Sound volume is somewhat weak and was my only negative. Otherwise I don,t understand some of the negative reviews here like retains fingerprints on tne case etc.  My router is in the basement of my 2 story home and I can go to any part of the house and still have connectivity. I purchased a bluetooth mouse and an external DVD burner from here at Amazon and I can now do just about anything on this laptop to what I ordinarily do on my PC. One other note, I was able to sync my password software to this laptop which further simplified my online activity. Four stars because of the weak sound.
This laptop is beautiful and well-made.  I wanted something sleek and lightweight, as well as feeling like a quality product, and this laptop is perfect in those regards.<br/><br/>The issues I've seen in other reviews are absolutely not issues for me -- the track pad does not click any louder than other laptops, my wifi works perfectly, and the speakers are exactly what you'd expect for a small laptop.  I can watch netflix in my living room without headphones with no problem.<br/><br/>I would absolutely recommend this laptop.
Coming from Apple products I didn't expect much out of this laptop.<br/><br/>The build quality is almost on par with my old Macbook Air, only things I miss are the mag safe adapter, glass touchpad and backlit keyboard, although the keyboard on the asus is nicer to type on for my taste.<br/><br/>Zero noise due to it's fanless design and runs much cooler than I expected. Processor has been pegged at 2ghz turbo mode since I booted it up due to updates, etc and it's still running cooler than the mac it replaced.<br/><br/>Hat off to ASUS for a well sorted product.
ASUS fortunately got rid of the poor rapid start feature.  This baby boots to the login screen in about 5 seconds and full windows in an additional 15 seconds, thanks to the SSD.  Battery life is excellent.  I go all day without charging.  The upgrade to W10 went without a hitch.  Make a recovery USB drive!  I tried installing AVG to replace my trial version of McAfee without uninstalling McAfee first and turned the Laptop into a vegetable.  The recovery drive saved the day.
Got my zenbook three days ago, was really impressed with the built quality and look, but it all of a sudden wouldn't power up today, called the Asus support and they determined that it has to be shipped back for service but I may get a refurbished unit as replacement. I researched online and found this to be uncommon that opening up the chassis and reset the battery connection may fix it. I didn't go that route as that would have voided the warranty. There is a reason why Apple product costs twice as much, you got what you paid for. :(
Form factor is good, as is build quality.  What isn't so good are the frequent windows display driver crashes.  Something wonky with the video processor and or drivers.  Search Google...it's not just mine, and it's not just once in a rare while that it happens.<br/><br/>This could be a great machine.  But constant video driver crashes and resets get old quickly.  Spend your money elsewhere.
I have been using this daily for office / school type work since it was released about 5 months ago.  It is an outstanding device for my needs.  Easily 8-10hr of battery life with constant use.  Streams HD perfectly, and handles all my applications fine.  It is not a CPU powerhouse and imagine would not perform well for gaming or intensive CPU use but its not advertised to be.  Only minor negative would be the weak built in speaker output volume, works great with headphones though.  I would recommend this device to anyone!
I've been working on it for the last 3 months now. The first thing I did before using it was to wipe out Windows, and install Ubuntu 14.04, which works quite well apart from slight glitches like brightness controls etc, which can be easily fixed with suggestions from Ubuntu forums.<br/><br/>It's very light, sleek and professional looking, with a good size keyboard. It's easy portability more than makes up for the 4 hour battery life. There are no fans, so it's not noisy. It came with an ethernet to USB cable and adapter.
It is such a beautiful computer! The color is almost like a rose gold color in between silver and gold.  The finish of the metal is super smooth and nice too. Keyboard and mouse pad are easy to use.  The setup was painless and windows 10 runs smoothly. I did a lot of research to pick a well priced 13 inch, I looked at comparable Apple computers but ultimately picked this and I seriously can't tell you how happy it made me. And for $699? I don't know but I thought it was a good deal.
Love it! It just arrived today and so far everything is great. I'm having a little trouble installing Windows 10 though. The first attempt failed due to some obscure update I was missing. I went to the Asus website and  downloaded the Windows 10 upgrade directly from the website. So far so good. It's almost downloaded but I have burned through the better part of the day doing this!  Hope it works! May have to revise this rating  however if the second attempt isn't successful.
Love this Zenbook. It is so quite, it is efficient for everyday tasks. I also have trouble staying connects to certain wi-fi. Noticed it only on campuses (noticed it on two university campuses in two different states, both of which I've never had problems with connecting to internet before this book). The battery life has been great, I've had it for 6 months. I will definitely be shopping for a solid state drive computer when it comes time to make my next purchase.
Incredibly fast and quiet. Great for everyday use.
I bought this laptop when I began a doctorate program recently.  It is very lightweight and sleek and very fast but honestly there is something holding me back from giving it 5 stars.  I have had a few occurrences where my screen will go black and a pop up will say that a driver crashed and has been recovered.  I have not had an issue with that other than it is just a bit annoying.  All in all I do enjoy this laptop a lot and would recommend it.
The laptop immediately set itself up with  some questions to the user, was able to quick add programs and needs for my business travels like the manner it handles.  Read many reviews about this laptop and for the most part it sold me on getting this ultra size and weight for my personal and business needs.  The mouse pad comments read about worked well for me and sensitive to movements correctly.  There are more review that are more technical and read those and more independently on the internet for the most part this product sold me and expect it to do well as I travel.  There is no perfect machine but this one is very close.
Love so many things about this laptop except...what I knew I'd miss - the light-up keyboard AND it gets very hot sometimes while working on it.  One other thing - which I read about in reviews is that the video goes out and has to reset randomly.  It only takes seconds to reboot the video, but it's still annoying.  LOVE the size, weight, keyboard.  And once I figured out how to put files on the D:drive, I have plenty of storage.
Great laptop, paid less than buying from a distributor.
Where you have been all my life?!?! I just finally laid my 2011 macbook pro to rest and did not feel all warm and fuzzy about dropping a couple thou on a replacement. I wanted something fast, AFFORDABLE, slim, light, and with a good amount of RAM. Done! Leaving te MAC OSX gave me a bit of anxiety, but Windows 10 is actually great and I'm so happy I missed out on having to use the previous version cuz every time I used a pc with that I got real stabby real fast.
I bought this to replace another ASUS computer I had for many years. I love the SSD hard drive...very quick start up and runs very cool. The screen clarity is awesome. Very happy with the keyboard. I didn't want to spend any more dollars for upgrade to i7 chip. I'm not a gamer and this i5 sizzles through apps. Very happy with this ASUS.
Works awesome, like a 1/2 price MacBook Air. Note that ConsumerReports thinks ASUS reliability is poor enough for them not to recommend it. After 4 months, I've had no problems. I'm basically using it as a dumb terminal (via TeamViewer) to be able to wander around work and operate my desktop machine. So I can't comment on the processor performance. Screen is nice. I do get 8+ hours of battery time usually.
Having to knock this down to one star.  Drivers for WiFi adapter kept dropping out, so for a bout a week I kept having to reinstall them.  Now the WiFi adapter isn't even being detected by the computer.  A waste of time and money, and there is no helpful information out there beyond software issues.  Seems I got a bad egg of a computer/WiFi adapter and I can't even send it back... I am super pissed.
Have been using it for a few weeks and I love it. It's very fast and was easy to set up. The picture is beautiful. Not a ton of storage space but what do you expect from such a lightweight and elegant laptop? Also don't love the speakers, they are a little quiet but not a problem if you use headphones. Otherwise it's a great computer for the price and the battery lasts very long.
EXCELLENT value for money. Great battery life, outstanding keyboard (but without backlight), really good trackpad, and 8/10 screen. Is Light and the construction and alloys are premium. Any other similar laptop, will cost you at least $500 more<br/><br/>You'll not be dissaponted. Go ahead and get it!
This laptop is all you need if you are looking for a thin weightless ultra book. It's downsides are that it has little memory, the hdmi port is smaller than usual  and that it doesn't have CD drive. But all of that aside is an excellent computer for college and school students with low budgets.
I wanted this model so much before I bought it. I even made pre-order here to wait for this laptop. But it fails me to give 5 stars. I might need to return it if the problem is not fixed.<br/>Pros:<br/>The color is really pretty.(I'm a lady) It is super thin and light as described. I have to be honest, the overall design is similar with Macbook air.<br/>The overall performance is as expected as well.(i5 model) Graphic performance is good without any issues on playing 1080p videos.<br/>I am a programmer and use lots of IDEs, which runs no problem on my zenbook. Keyboard is very comfortable except the power button is at where I often hit delete button. I click it by mistake once a while but I will get used to this keyboard. Oh, no matter whatever you are running, this machine is super super quiet, because there is no fan.<br/>Cons:<br/>I am really not picky. I noticed the comments that wifi could be a problem. I am aware of this. Mine wifi won't be disconnected without reason, but the signal is really really weak. I just don't understand the modem is just beside me, why I never can get a full signal. It's alright, I don't need to compete with macbook to get internet.  The machine get warm whenever I use it, I understand, there is no fan. The battery life is ok cuz I don't expect much, with around 5 hours life if I just use word and web browser, only 3 hours life if I do anything else. I totally can live with this. And I understand this is a whole new battery and it will get shorter soon.<br/>All above, I really can live with it. But, there is a but that makes me return it. The two-finger gesture never working. As a basic laptop, you know you should be able to scroll down the screen with touch pad or mouse pad whatever it called. I tried any two gesture I can think about. Dragging two fingers to scroll up/down, and left/right, left-click with srolling, right-click with scrolling. No, not work. I don't have that gesture set. And I found the link from ASUS website<br/> http://support.asus.com/Troubleshooting/detail.aspx?SLanguage=en&p=3&m=UX305LA&s=747&hashedid=sITFQ5s2detcnty5&os=&no=1776<br/>I guess there is this tool that I can use to set the gestures. But I could not find it. Even on this page, beside "knowlege", this tab called "download". The link is not corrected linked. What can I do? Please help! If I can fix this touch pad problem, I would definitely keep it. But I can not live with this issue.<br/>Overall, this laptop really worth this price. Only if ASUS check their products before they shipped out to the customer. The defect rate is too high for a new laptop. Please read the reviews from all the customers. I believe if it was not the manufactory problems, this laptop would have higher rate and more buyers.
For my purposes, this computer has been amazing! A best buy for a modestly-priced ultrabook. Very fast to boot up, keyboard is best I have used for this sort of device, and screen is magnificent with rich colors. If you are looking for a reasonably-priced laptop with SSD (and you do want SSD; trust me!), you should definitely consider this machine.
Probably the best notebook out there. This is my second one plus my main server is Asus for my home business. No one makes a better unit than Asus. And no, I don't work for them. I use these professionally and they are lightweight, solid, strong, and beautiful to look at as well.
Awesome design. All aluminum case with 2.6 pounds light weight. Intel M processor, 8GB memory, 1600LDR are just as same as the all new designed MacBook. The HD display looks ok, not as sharp as retina display. No back light keyboard, that's the only thing I dislike. Besides that, everything is just way more worth than the price you're gonna pay.
This I have to say  is the perfect one for your daily use especially for presentations. The specs are pretty much improved compared to the other models. the thin and silver to gray finish made it more look polished. plus points for being so handy but heavy in perfomance
When the product arrived, everything inside was very fine.<br/>The design is just like the Mac laptop.<br/>It would be better if it also included VGA and converter for ethernet and also sleeve.<br/>Except for those, everything of the laptop is really fine.
Have had this computer for three months and no complaints so far! Super lightweight, holds a charge for a long time (7-8 hours), relatively fast opening applications. Only complaint would be that the keyboard isn't very deep so it takes some getting used to (easy to click the wrong key). I think it's a goo value!
Pros: Fast, slim, light, pricing is fair, battery life is amazing (up to 10 hrs).<br/><br/>Cons: Video card crashes every now and then (others seem to have this issue), sometimes the turbo for the process doesn't work and the speed is limited at 1 Ghz (restarting always seem to solve the issue).
Although I have only had this for about a day I would say it is great the specifications for the i5 with windows 10 can be found on Asus's website.<br/><br/>Pros: Gorgeous IPS FHD sceen and contrast and color look good.<br/>Intel® Core™ i5-5200U Processor which has turbo boost up to 2.7 Ghz meaning its clock speed which is 2.2 Ghz can be temporarily increased if the processor is in need of additional performance to keep things fast and smooth<br/>8 Gb ram 1600 mhz.<br/>256 GB SSD which allows it to boot in 6 seconds and open up files really quickly also thanks to the ram. Although it actually came with a formatted 237 Gb, which windows 10 takes up about 20 gb of, but still good if you keep in mind how much space you still get!<br/>3 cell 56whr battery that based on other reviews lasts pretty long and I am too since I charged it for about an hour and it hasn't went under 90% yet.<br/>Titanium Gold color is visually pleasing.<br/>No bloatware this is a Microsoft Signature Edition meaning it is free of bloatware and was on Microsoft site but taken down as this is a laptop made earlier in the year.<br/>Very good Packaging. It came in a big  not so heavy shipping box with wrapping paper to protect and the shipping box had the laptop box  in it which had yet another box which is the real one and the laptop comes wrapped in plastic paper which is easily taken out with a little slip sticking out of its compartmentalized box.<br/>Fast shipping. (Pro for amazon) Amazon said December 3-8 but it arrived on December 1 about 9-10 in the morning.<br/>Cons: Not any that I can think of.<br/>Overall: This is a good laptop and if you are comparing other laptops like a Dell XPS 13 or an Macbook Air/Pro or whatever other ultrabooks.... This thing will give more space and ram for less money than the competition! If you are considering those other laptops: this will be your best bet for less money but still your choice and if you do order this I hope you like it as much as I do! Good Job Asus!
Very lightweight, quiet, firm, perfect key height, chiclet keyboard means easier typing. The latest intel processor on board, very energy efficient.<br/>Benchmarks so far have clicked it at 15W peak, but it aims at 5W average, which is about 3x lower than my last (2008) laptop it is replacing, and also gets about 3x the battery life out of a similar sized battery.<br/><br/>Some users found it has a sloppy hinge, but I have found no problems with it.<br/><br/>Performance wise it will do anything you throw at it, and does it well, but with exceptions to:<br/>1- Video encoding (is very slow)<br/>2- Modern games<br/>3- Benchmarks (low results).<br/><br/>I've upgraded my pc to Win 10, and I'm still testing, but it plays some older DX9 games for Win XP or Win 98, with graphics settings maxed out at between 120 and 180fps.<br/>Some older game benchmarks are off the chart, like 370-1200fps!<br/><br/>For reference comparison:<br/><br/>My 2005 desktop pc: AMD Athlon XP2600+ with Riva TNT32 or AMD Radeon 4500 ran Oni, MDK2, and a few other games at about 60fps at 800x600pix.<br/>This laptop has about 12x better gaming performance (3x faster fps at 4x higher resolution 1080p).<br/><br/>My 2008 Core2Duo T5500 Sony Vaio laptop, with GMA950 clocked  at 275Mhz boosted to 400Mhz with GMA booster, which ran the above games at just under 60fps at 1024x768 or 1280x720 pix resolution,<br/>ran Fantasy Star Unlimited at 30-50fps at 1024x768pix.<br/>Still about 2x faster fps in games at double the resolution (1080p), or about 4x better gaming experience.<br/><br/>So, in short,<br/>Most DX9 games of old (before 2012) will run at 120+fps at 1080p.<br/>At 1080p this laptop can run some dx10 games, but DX11 graphics intensive games of the last 5 years, need to be dialed down to 480 or 600pix. Even 720pix has trouble keeping up at full graphics settings, but you could run 720p DX10 or DX11 games at reduced graphics quality.<br/><br/>It runs latest 3D vantage benchmarks, but with very low framerates of about 5 upto 20fps.<br/><br/>Worthy to note:<br/>This pc will work better in colder 68f environments, and on a cold metal table, than in a cosy 78F bedroom on top of a pillow or bedsheet. The bottom can get really hot, but not hot enough to burn skin, unless you keep it there for several minutes.<br/>Only gets hot while gaming, or running benchmarks.<br/>Asus put a sticker on the hottest spot on the bottom, so you won't get burned, but the hotter the bottom, the lower the performance.<br/><br/>Upgradeable to Win 10, but Win 10 has problems emulating older operating systems. If your games ran on Windows 95 and 98, chances are they won't run on this.<br/>If they ran on Win 98-winXP, chances are they will.<br/>If they ran on XP-Vista-Win 7, chances are they will work fine on this, though with either reduced graphics or resolutions.<br/>If they ran on win 7 and onwards, you're pretty sure they will run on Win 10, but with reduced graphics.<br/><br/>It runs most 4k demos, like elevated at 720p at a fluid framerate too! (Search for "breakpoint 09 elevated")<br/><br/>I don't like the trackpad at all!<br/>It's a one-button, Apple-style trackpad, that needs your finger location to determine if you right or leftclicked.<br/>It doesn't know what to do, if it doesn't register a finger on the trackpad (eg: clicking with nails, or gloves), or when 2 fingers are used at the same time (eg:resting both fingers on the spots, while clicking with one).<br/>This is very disadvantageous for gaming!<br/><br/>Second strike, is the SD card doesn't fully go inside the device. You won't be able to just leave the SD card in, and throw the laptop in a backpack.<br/><br/>Third thing I resent, is that the battery on this device isn't all that great!<br/>Yes, battery life is, but that's only because the computer uses so little power.<br/>They could have easily increased the battery size, to a normal laptop battery size, or equip it with a port for mounting and equipping an extension battery pack (like playback over docking station pins, or even USB 3 port, would have done it for me).<br/>If I'd have to guess, I'd say this laptop is provided with a 3000mAh battery; they could have easily gone with a 4 or 6000mAh battery, and have double the life out of a charge!
First, I am prob. not the best laptop reviewer, as I only upgrade every few years, so I am easily impressed with each new model I use, as the technology jumps are so impressive with each new machine I own.  I was looking for a nice thin easy carry laptop, and this Asus Zenbook is perfect!!  Amazingly thin!  How they pack in that much technology in a PC this thin is beyond amazing.  Build quality is superb, feels very solid.  No backlit keyboard, but when you want tiny, often some features u must surrender.  Other than a back lit keybard, this does everything I want and more.  I love the mini HD port for a 2nd display, great for desk use.  I will upgrade soon to accommodate this.... the unit has no fan, so I will sit the unit on a pc cooler when at my desk.  It gets very warm, but not excessively hot.  But the more you push these PC's, the hotter they run..and heat is the enemy for all PC's.  AT this thin size, an internal fan is not possible...<br/><br/>I am a but clunky with Windows 10, but that is another story ;)<br/><br/>Two USB 3.0 ports is nice... I never realized how blazing fast these ports are, till I hooked up an external hard drive in one. sheeesh!  The track pad is OK at best, but again, u must consider how thin and small this laptop is.  You can't have the BEST of all features, specially mechanical features,  and maintain the size this small... it works well enough in a crunch, otherwise, I use a small a mini microsoft BT mouse.  Battery life although rated at 10hrs, prob. less if you drive the machine hard... so far, I had it go 7 hours with no problems... so, again, considering its size, that is very impressive to me.<br/><br/>Screen colors are excellent considering the size...sure, my $2K desktop LED displays are better, but, they are HUGE... to pack this much light in such a tiny display is again, impressive.  No lag on display when working with files in Photoshop.  Asus mentions 178 deg viewing angle... not sure about that, but its better than any other laptop I have ever used... at least 120 deg with the best views being in the 80 deg range from center (+/- 40 deg).  The "ac" vs. "n" wifi connections is NOTICEABLY faster... but, that is not unique to this PC, but rather, just upgraded technology to the entire industry.  256GB Solid state hard drive... very generous size considering PC size and its thinness.  Its very fast... and with USB 3.0 port, easy to carry a larger drives which are very compact these days.<br/><br/>Overall, Assus has packed an amazing amount of the latest and greatest features and offer it a very impressive price point.  The mixture of all this, its hard for me NOT to give this pc 5 star rating.  I know other reviewers are much harder on each feature, but IMO, u have to evaluate the price vs. performance ratio of the product, vs. what other competitors have to offer.  Sure, there is better laptops, but they get bigger and way more costly.<br/><br/>Will try to update this review in due time after more use...
This computer is overall amazing! I would buy this computer every single time if given the choice.<br/><br/>Amazing aspects: Weight - this thing is light and sleek. It's like carrying a notebook around. Build quality - IT FEELS well built and again sleek. The aluminum feels solid, lifting the screen with one-hand is magic, and fingerprints don't show. Screen - the matte screen is really nice considering I like to work outside. It's bright enough everywhere, and the full HDness is nice. Keyboard/trackpad - Despite some criticisms, I love both very much. Good feedback on the keys and the trackpad is smooth and responsive. Speed - THIS THING IS FAST. I thought SSD's weren't that much better than HDD's, but I was wrong. I average a 6 second boot up time, and from sleep is almost instantaneous. I mainly play KSP and TF@, but both are fast on high settings. No problems with the processing capabilities.<br/><br/>Good aspects - BAttery life - I only charge to 60% and that lasts me the entire day most days. Coolness - The fan only really runs when im gaming, but its fairly quiet. The keyboard and trackpad area never get hot, but the area above the keyboard gets pretty hot when playing KSP. Not really a problem though. My legs never get hot.<br/><br/>Bad aspects - Driver issues - I probably have the display driver crash on me 4 times a week. Im using windows 10, and the driver is back up in less than 3 seconds. Annoying, but not too bad.<br/><br/>For the price, this machine beats any other on the market right now IMO. I did a lot of research prior to buying this, and am really happy with my choice. This laptop is perfect for people who want a long-lasting, sleek, portable laptop that can handle most computer duties.
This laptop was worth every penny. The build quality it top notch. Screen is beautiful. I showed this to a Mac fanboy and he suddenly felt buyers remorse for spending $1,400 bucks on basically the same thing.
I have been using this laptop for about a month now, and I have no major complaints so far. The sleek design is perfect for carrying around all day. I also love the "matte" screen, which makes it easy to read things on my computer outdoors or near a window.
I am writing this review from my Asus Zenbook UX305FA. It is perfectly thin and useful as I am project manager and developer for IT based projects. ASUS didn't suprise me with its' quality and make.
This is a great Ultra book. I gave it four stars because I am still getting use to the 13.3 inch size. Otherwise the laptop is starts very quickly and is very responsive. At this time I have no problems with the device. I have used it for two months now.
Pros: Very light, easy to carry around, battery lasts for a long time, doesn't overheat, doesn't make a sound, very elegant design.<br/><br/>Cons: it can get a bit slow sometimes, it doesn't have a backlit keyboard.<br/><br/>Overall, great product!
Great laptop for the price. Looked for long time and this was the best laptop for the price. Definately buy it if you are looking for a good laptop and dont need the touch screen feature.
fast,  looks great,  works well
Very handy...light but powerful
OK if you aren't looking for the WiFi to actually work.  After screwing around with this laptop for almost a month I finally returned it to Amazon.  The WiFi adaptor would randomly disappear from the device manager.  Not just a bad connection or failure to connect to a WiFi network but a complete disappearance of the WiFi Adapter from the device manager.  Now I work in IT and am familiar with the troubleshooting process.  Since this had Windows 10 installed after two weeks I assumed that it was likely the device did not have Win10 drivers installed so I went to ASUS and downloaded the newest drivers available for the WiFi Adapter.  This worked till rebooting and then again the adapter would randomly disappear.  The machine is sleek, light, responsive, and has awesome battery life but with no external LAN port without the WiFi what's the point.  I have a very large paper weight that can't get on the web.  In the end it is either the Windows 10 drivers associated with this device or a faulty internal Web Adapter.  Now yes you can install a USB WiFi Adapter but when you spend 700 bucks you expect it to work out of the box.  I shouldn't have to shell out another 20-30 bucks for an unsightly USB WiFi adapter.  Windows 8.1 is plain terrible and apparently at this point Windows 10 is just not quite ready, at least for this machine.  Overall a disappointment....
I use this for school normally and it does everything I want in great speed and quality. The travel distance on the keys are great feeling and the built quality is great. I would highly recommend this laptop over any Macbook Air!
got it for my sister who wanted a cheep laptop and desktop. I said spend all your money on a good laptop and then plug it into your monitor and keyboard when you want to.  she loves being mobile so much she never does that.
Returning it after 3 days. Connectivity issues -WIFI speed extremely slow. While the Lenovo next to it worked at great speed, the ASUS took forever to load a page.
fast comfortable and light, the only thing i do not like is the fact you can see every fingerprint on the keyboard mouse and cover<br/>i have to clean it all the time
I love this computer
I love this laptop. Everything works great. It's fast, light, super portable, and thin. No back light. But I personally don't mind. It lasts for a long time.
Seems like a very nice notebook; however, died within a month or so and had to send back to have motherboard replaced. Hopefully will be better from here.
I purchased the ASUS Zenbook UX305 FA (Core M) 13.3 inch just over a month ago and have been using it everyday for work since. Based on my month's experience I am very pleased with the mobility and the performance. It is ridiculously light and thin, perfect for travelling with and the screen size is ideal for me. I was slightly concerned it may be too small following years of working off a 15.6 inch but I haven't noticed the change. I upgraded to Windows 10 straight away which has caused a slight problem with the Intel graphics driver which means it keeps crashing but I plan to change the driver which Im hoping will solve the problem. My only other niggle is the slightly 'clunky' keypad but it wouldn't sway my opinion or stop me from recommending the machine. This is my first ASUS purchase and Im impressed so far.
I was gonna give it five stars, but then I heard the headphone output, irritable is the word that comes to mind.<br/>Everything else is just great.<br/><br/>I continued to listen to it, and I think that it got better, or  I just  got used to it
Love this laptop! Boots up super fast. The only thing is that it does get a little hot when running multiple programs, but cools down very quickly.
Perfect product :)<br/>very thin, light, strong.<br/>But It is hot partially. So I cannot use on my thigh.<br/>Except that, I love my ux305 :)
I have had this notebook for a little over a month now and the finish is already scratched and damaged, even though it is kept in a sleeve and is not hit by anything. It browses the web very slowly. The screen resolution looks washed out and a little blurry. The keyboard is a little weird. The hinge is also very weak and will fall if the laptop is jarred a little during use. it is not complete silent either, You can hear an annoying hiss coming from it, it also gets pretty hot. I only gave it two stars for the weight. It is light as a feather.
Great laptop for everyday use. Performance is good and overall design is clean and attractive. This is one of the lightest laptops I've seen.
Great  Laptop.  Probably 7 hours of normal business use real world... pretty awesome for the price
Same basic review as Adam's February 24, 2015 one. Great little laptop. The first thing I did was to install Linux Mint 17.1, which pretty much worked right out of the box. I had the same issue of the screen brightness Fn5 and Fn6 keys not working, but installing xbacklight fixed that (thanks for the hint, Adam).<br/><br/>I did install linux kernel 3.18.13, because I was sometimes having a problem with applications like Google Chrome blacking out after suspend/restore. Installing the 3.18.13 kernel from http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/ fixed that, and now I have no issues with the laptop. Battery life is good, ~ 6 - 7 hours, screen quality is great, wifi works fine, etc.<br/><br/>Highly recommend this laptop, especially for use with Linux.
I bought this to replace a Toshiba Z830 as I wanted the better processor/screen and storage, I travel a lot and need an ultra-portable PC. I looked at buying in UK but the M processor version with 128GB only is £650 ($975). I bought the i5 and Amazon shipped to me in Abu Dhabi within less than 96hrs and with only c.$50-60 shipping costs! Frankly I was amazed at the speed of delivery and can confirm that the PC is pretty much all I could reasonably expect. The lack of backlighting is an issue but I'll live with it, otherwise the performance is first class and it's whisper quiet. I have never heard any fan noise, but then have not heavily loaded it. I Highly recommend the Zenbook i5 and would commend Amazon for exceptional service.
I am so inspired from the product and its just so awesome and sexy that I would recommend anyone to go for IT!!!!!!!!!!!!.<br/>I wanted to give full FIVE STARS but I'm giving four only bcoz of heating in the bottom part occasionally.<br/><br/>Just felt like the Macbook Air quality when I held it for the first time.<br/>Nevertheless to mention, the boot time of the Win 8.1 is super amazing for two reasons,<br/>1. Due to 256GB of SSD Hard disk.<br/>2. Intel Core M processor : Deadly combination I feel.<br/><br/>Mind blowing battery life on l have ever witnessed in Windows laptops.<br/>Very handy and useful to carry all the time.<br/>Infact writing this review in the very own Zenbook UX305. Just loved it.
Lightweight, haven't had any major issues. Long battery life. I sometimes have to use a mouse because I don't love the touchpad.
Useful Ultrabook
It's very light. Very convenient to carry to school. In addition, it runs very fast. I love this product. Recommend to buy it!
Just got this from Microsoft store. There is a $100 discount going on + 10% collage discount. paid $540 for the machine.<br/><br/>First Impression - I was planning to buy a MBA but wanted to have Windows machine as most of the finance software that I use had to run on parallel on MBA. Was also thinking about Surface Pro 3, but was going out of budget.., Decided to try this. This looks incredible. I can't judge the performance as I have just started it using but first impression is very impressive.<br/>I liked the IPS non glare display. It is a closest to Mac Book Air for Windows.<br/><br/>Will update this review after couple of weeks use.. First Impression.. AWESOME Machine..<br/><br/>** Update**<br/>After two weeks of use, this laptop is running wonderful. I don't to carry around my Dell E640 any where. This thing is extremely light and fun to work with.<br/><br/>One more thing - ASUS offers accidental damage protection for 1 year. You have to register for it separately though. I didn't notice this in the fine print. Don't miss it.
Really fast, great looking laptop. Only issue as of now is the sound of the speakers (though very full) are slightly soft.
slim and sleek
This is by far the best Asus notebook I've ever purchased.  Very light weight, very fast, very slim.  Windows 8 is bit weird. The CPU is Intel Core M. I love the SSD, which is very quiet.  I don't have to envy those Macbooks at Starbucks. I will get another Zenbook soon for my son when I travel to Maryland in the summer to avoid paying California sales tax and the recycling fee. By the way, the audio is not strong, hence I am getting a Bluetooth speaker to complement the audio experience.  Also the mouse is acting a bit weird in Windows 8, so I am using Amazon's wireless mouse for accuracy pointing.
The size, thin profile, and light weight are fabulous as is the SSD hard drive.  CPU power and RAM are more than adequate for my needs. The keyboard and display are OK, the delete key by the off button is a mistake, and the clicky touchpad is very annoying.  3 USB ports are nice to have.  I really would have preferred a model that had a power supply that used a USB port.  The power supply itself is a bit large for such a small computer.  The color is a bit unusual.  Overall, this is a good deal for the price but, if I were to buy again, I would look a little harder at some other models.
Great laptop and light. Also pretty powerful and the screen looks very nice. And all for a very nice price
Try to find any ultra portable with a 2.2 ghz i5 and compare the price to this, it's got the perfect specs for such a cheap price.  Since there is no heavy duty graphics card, I installed ubuntu 14.04 on it and pretty much everything works perfectly out of the box except brightness keys which I have made a work around.<br/><br/>I purchased this for watching netflix, work( remote desktop in linux is just as if you're really on the work computer ) and some coding.  The only downside is the metal casing gets dirty really easy but I don't really care about that.
Great laptop.
My second ASUS laptop.  So far, I like it more than the last one which I didn't think would be possible.
I was first on the wall about this computer when my friend sent me the asus prduct page link. I love asus. I've had the budget x401a for 3 years, i recommended my girlfriend a small netbook by asus. I think they're a wonderful company. Please note that this will not excuse what I write in my review.<br/><br/>First impressions are great, the laptop is astonishingly light, and feels premium and nice quality with unibody metal. The first thing to bother me was the windows scaling of some applications. This is a 1080p screen in a 13" form factor, but on default settings windows scales stuff like pidgin IM window horribly and the font blurs in a nasty manner. I've achieved a good balance between text window and screen real estate playing with multiple options for a while. I wanted to utalize the high resolution screen real estate but I need to be able to rad what content I have.<br/><br/>SSD in this lightning fast and read and checked the hash of 30gbs of ~30k files for a game in under 30 seconds.<br/><br/>Alot of people complain about the lack of a backlit keybord but I have never needed one, and neither should anyone over the age of 12. "touch feel typing" feels really great. The key actuation is easy and all the keys are the same, unlike my x401a with a space bar that needed twice the normal pressure to activate. I'm taking my time learning the key shortcuts like for example, fn + right arrow is your *home * button on the keyboard and the right arrow i * end* the right and left keys are easy to hit. its the up and down arrows that are  little to teeny tiny, but I'm sure I will get used to.<br/><br/>Specification wise this thing is INCEREDIBLY powerful. I had no idea an upgrade from a low end pentium to a Core-M would result in such a gain in performance. When i got the laptop I charged it to 100% and set it on balanced. I got a good 6-7 hour use doing web browsing, watching youtube videos and playing phantasy star online 2 for just a little bit. going from 100-20%. I charge at 20% out habit to keep the battery life as long as I can.<br/><br/>Screen is great once you get it configured, the core-M cpu can put out a hell of a lot more power than I imagined and the battery is hard to believe but lasts for a very long time.<br/><br/>The wifi is my big issue with this laptop. Constantly does it fluctuate between 5 and 2 bars when my previous laptop had a strong and steady 3-4 bar connection at any time of day in the same location. and I am using the windows 8 task manager to read reciving data speed. Half of the time the reader never goes over 140kbps. And it disconnects randomly all the time. Asus includes a usb to Rj-45 ethernet adapter but my powerline connection is used on my desktop and I needed a wireless laptop for a reason, so its rather useless to me. Another thing  about the disconnects is that it doesnt make an effort to reconnect to the network. This is very frustrating during initial setup as I could not even download my waterfox installer without going down stairs to the router room. This is can be a deal breaker for me. I've yet to try it at school with lots of bus signals but more overall stronger connection. Wifi lasts if you stand perfectly still and dont touch the machine But honestly I don't know if I'm going to keep it. I love Asus and all of their products but I will give this laptop a while longer to try out before I reach my verdict.<br/><br/>Edit: I've had the machine for a couple of days and I've noticed the wifi issue has settled down, I tried using it at a school library where there is tons of wifi and interference and it performed much better than it did originally. I'm giving it the 2 extra stars I left out originally. Asus does it again, rest assured its a great machine.
I love this laptop. Although it runs on the "have to get used to" Windows 8 operating system and I hate hate the apps that come from the app store, it is really a fantastic computer. The light weight of it alone makes it completely worth it. I grab it and go and since I travel for a living it is so nice to not feel like I am carrying around a microwave. The apps it has pre-loaded onto it are kind of neat but some of them are only compatible with a touch screen (awkward) so beware.
My thoughts on the Zenbook ux305:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/> - Thin and light<br/> - Keyboard is most excellent<br/> - Screen is bright and great quality<br/> - No fan noise<br/> - I haven't noticed any surprising performance issues. I'd read some complaints about it being slow but haven't felt this myself.<br/> - I haven't noticed any hot spots like some reviews have mentioned. I've noticed it more with other normal laptops. This was surprising as well.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/> - The screen comes with a sticker on it. This is just dumb. It left no residue but was just annoying.<br/> - The color is misleading. It says it is black. The pictures make it look black. The one I got is NOT black. The outer shell is close to black. The keys are black... but the rest of the inside is more like some kind of super dark eggplant color. I've seen differing product photos on the web... and let me be clear, the inside of the device does not look like the product photos -- it is NOT black. It still looks nice, but is misleading.<br/> - The power button is just a plain old key on the keyboard and is in the spot where the delete key should be. If you accidentally press it the computer goes to sleep.<br/> - You have to use a function key to access the page up, page down, home and end keys. These are keys I use frequently so I find it annoying.<br/><br/>Overall its a really solid ultrabook, I love it. Just has a few minor quirks to get used to. I'd buy it again. Biggest disappointment for me was the fact that it isn't actually black like the pictures and description, but I am happy with it and the way it looks nonetheless. I recommend it and think it is well worth the price.<br/><br/>Update -- The Zenbook runs Windows 10 without any issues. Painless upgrade.
So far so good. Love that it is thin and easy to use. Cool, sleek look. The price is right.
Cannot say enough good about this computer, if you love the way the new super light Macbook lines feel but want a PC and a cheaper price, this is it. The specs are exactly what they say they are and Crucial has a 500 gig ssd up grade for it for 200 if you need more space. And don't give too much credence to the cons in the reviews, unless you need a power house of a computer. But for the everyday stuff 90% of use use a machine for this is it and light as a feather.
Great form factor. Completely silent. Great great screen.<br/><br/>Bad:  no backlit keyboard. Track pad is mediocre, and you can't adjust sensitivity. Click buttons are insanely loud and cheap sounding.<br/><br/>Processor is fine for small tasks, DO NOT expect a full processor experience though.
just the same as macbook air but much cheaper than it,now I updated to WIN10,excellent.
no question buy it but with tax via the asus website  its cheaper ! I have been threw about 6 laptops in 4 years this takes the cake ! perfect in every way although i wish the battery lasted 3 hours longer ! The core-m is not made for games ,but video editing and YouTube and documents you will be fine I Promise :) . It took 20 mins for me to edit and upload a video that was 18 mins and 720p !!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3dJ-sl8agk
Overall a great deal.  I have been using it for about 24 hours by now.  As some of other people mentioned earlier, I do have problems with the power key because it locates at where delete key usually is at.  I accidentally powered down twice because I wanted to hit delete key.  Other than that, I have not encountered any problems.  Also, using it as remote desktop client is also not so bad (because of small fonts).
Great laptop i am using it for college it does everything i need it to and more
This laptop it's a dream. Why? It's so light and thin that you can't imagine.
Just about bought the Lenovo 450s.... until I found a review of the Zenbook UX305FA. This is the best value in laptops/notebooks at the current price point: super light, beautiful HD IPS display, aluminum case top and bottom, 256GB SSD, 8GB memory. Really nothing compares. Actually,for a "junior" version of the UX305FA, the ASUS X205TA is very solid and does compare favorably for under $200.
The laptop is good and light. The color is beautiful as to me. However, with Win 10, the default font of laptop is difficult to see. Blurry. It's not a good user experience. Well, so-called 12 hours battery is not as long as it seems. I have used three or four times (maybe 4 hours once)and charge laptop twice now. After all, it's a convenient laptop, but still have space to improve.
Wonderful computer to use on the go. As a sales professional, I am constantly en route somewhere and having this 2.6lb computer is a dream.<br/><br/>I love that it is solid state and it actually performs really well. I work only in the cloud, and it is very quick with email, docs etc. Sure it does slow down a little when streaming video, but it quickly recovers. Highly recommend.
Long battery life (>10 hours). Prefect for college student that is barely able to find a working plug in the library. It stay for half a day without any issue. I use this machine to google and read pdf when I am in the school. Not really need to bring my charger along with me. One draw back is it is not really that fast since it is running a low power consumption processor.
Look and feel are quite nice. However some big issues and I'm going to return this as I can't use it for work. Rubber pads on rear are unable to contact table when screen is up, so it slides around. Keyboard doesn't type the 'n' key very well, it will type it once but two ns in a row often the 2nd one doesn't type. Touch pad isn't able to register movement very well.
If you've always wanted a Mac, but could never afford it, this is the computer for you. With the great design of Macs and the interface of Windows this computer is the best of both worlds. Great price, large SSD, IPS screen, beautiful design, Windows 10, and a good battery life; there is absolutely no reason to not get this laptop if your budget is between 500-1000.<br/><br/>Revision: The computer is no longer a 5 out of 5, not its more like a 4.75 out of 5:<br/><br/>The charging cable is far too short, making it so that as it extends people have to jump over the cable and others who don't see it can even get caught in it leading to them falling down and the computer being damaged.<br/><br/>The battery life is getting worse with every charge, and while that is to be expected I did not expect it to happen this early.<br/><br/>The F-buttons are on top, and every time I need to change the volume or brightness I have to press shift. Asus, no one uses the F-buttons! make the volume and brightness buttons the primary ones.<br/><br/>The  speakers are awful, but I won't remove point for that as with the pric I knew they had to make some compromises.<br/><br/>Replace the USB-2 with an USB C.<br/><br/>The track pad is good for a Windows computer, but I would  appreciate it if two fingers was a right click, like on Macs.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is still one of the best Laptops released this year, but like anything else, it has flaws. I am sure Asus can improve those things with no problem, and if they release an I7 version next year with those improvements, you can be sure I will be buying it.
Love the portability.  Would buy it again.  It goes everywhere with me.
Lightweight, slim and fast. I got this for going off to University in the fall and I used it to finish out my semester at community college, it worked great. I have not had much time to play with it, but I am impressed with what I have seen. Especially the battery, 10 hours is about accurate, though if you are multi-tasking it can drop below that, but not much.
Plugged right into all my networks; fast and easy setup.  It's exactly what i need for travel.  My tablet just wasn't enough for the photography i like to do when on the road.  This isn't my home machine, where i'll definitely do most of my post-processing, but this really gives me a lot more power than just the tablet.  Super lightweight and easy to use.
Everything Is Excellent but the processor is weaker than some phones
Great machine; wonderfully light and reasonably powerful.  2 stars because mini-HDMI had all sorts of problems so I cannot drive big monitors with this machine - apparently I am not the only one with this problem.  I found a workaround but, as a long-time owner of multiple ASUS laptops, this is the first time that quality has  let me down.
Hello, I bought this as a replacement to a 2015 Macbook Air 13.3" 128gb, and wow, I was majorly disappointed. I owned this for 3 weeks, and used it on a 75mbps internet connection.<br/><br/>*Pros: This is a slim, lightweight laptop.<br/><br/>*Cons: See below.<br/>*Battery life: ~5hrs with google docs open, mild internet browsing (mostly dropbox and google drive). This is nowhere close to the estimated 10 hours. I think they are getting 10 hours for idle time. For example, when my computer was left on during my professor's lecture, my estimated battery life was 9 hours. Then when I started typing notes, the time went to 3 hours.<br/>*Trackpad: This does not offer non-linearly scrolling. If you swipe fast with your two finger gesture, the page does not scroll any faster. Windows 10 also does not have an option for you to adjust this. You can only toggle how many lines at a time you scroll, which just makes scrolling really jumpy and erratic. The trackpad also does not follow your finger well. I will often try to click a link or a tab, and I will miss. However, if you have a mouse, this issue is avoided. Also, sometimes the cursor would end up in parts of the screen that I did intend for it to go, and I do not know why. I never had this issue on my Macbook.<br/>*Performance: Mozilla Firefox and Chrome load pages in a choppy fashion. If you try to do any actions while a webpage is loading, the computer fails to respond and lags. I was able to play League of Legends at the lowest settings with only minor lag, so this has same limited gaming potential. For example, when I went to scroll down the Amazon page for this laptop, it lagged while scrolling, and all I have open are 4 other tabs in FireFox...<br/><br/>Bottom line: I would not recommend this to students or professionals. The computer is not reliable, and the little hiccups interfere with workflow.<br/><br/>Note#1: I am not an apple fanboy. I have built two gaming PC's for my wife and my friend; however, I have been using a MacBook Air for the last 3 years, so it has become my benchmark for laptop performance.<br/>Note#2: I bought the MacBook Air 13.3" 2015 model for 749.99+tax in May 2015, so, I am not comparing the UX305FA-USM1 to the regular price MacBook.<br/>Note#3: If you have a Microsoft Store and an Apple Store near you, I would suggest you go play with this laptop and then the Macbook Air, and see what I mean.
Very good laptop. Though touch pad could have been better implemented. Major drawback is a lack of keyboard backlighting. I think UX305 definitely worth its price. You won't be able to find such a nice looking, lightweight laptop with Full HD display from any other manufacturer for 650 USD. Device feels reliable as well.
I really like this laptop, and as soon as I received it, I installed Ubuntu and it worked perfectly.  The only thing I gave 4 out of 5 stars is that power cable.  It is loosely connected no matter how hard I tried.  In other words, the power cable is not properly attached to the laptop even if you push really hard.
No trialware or freeware installed. Very good value for money
This review is for the Zenbook UX305LA Titanium Gold Zenbook<br/><br/>As I have grown older, my hands and wrists have gotten decidedly weaker. Because of this, I was searching for a lighter laptop than my 15" Dell.  The 13" Zenbook is definitely the answer.<br/>It's SUPER light, weighing in at about 2 pounds. Even on a bad hand day, lifting it is not an issue. I also tend to have a very light touch on the keys, and the Zenbook has no problem recognizing my strokes.<br/>My computer usage is very low tech. I really don't care HOW it runs as long as it DOES. I email, shop, do social media, mess with photos a bit, watch movies on Netflix and videos on YouTube. Not only has the Zenbook performed these tasks, it has done it at lightening speed.<br/><br/>I have read reviews and will share my experiences with the concerns expressed by others.<br/>Battery life: using mine for the aforementioned tasks, I get 10 hours of battery use on a daily basis. I don't know why I do and others don't, but it is what happens.<br/>Airplane mode: Mine doesn't light up at all, although there is the little light dot on it. ??<br/>Keyboard: Others have said that the keyboard required serious hitting, mine responds with a feather touch.<br/><br/>I know that it is of no consequence to how it works, but the Zenbook is beautiful! There is a very, very faint texture to the surface as opposed to being slick. The titanium gold is actually a kind of burnished silver. It's design is sleek and modern looking and turns a few heads at the local coffee shop.<br/><br/>I
Nice laptop. Super quiet with the SSD. Very quick to boot up. However, the letter T only works about 50% of the time when you type. Upon further inspection, it is obvious that the plastic key is not sitting correctly and different from the all the other keys. Therefore, it's going back to Amazon...
Love this thing.  Fast and powerful.
It's a laptop.  I don't need a large hard drive, but I do want thin, lightweight, and fast.  Boy is it fast.  Startup is the quickest I've ever had on a laptop . . . and it's quiet.  That's the beauty of SSDs.<br/><br/>The screen is beautiful -- a matte display that I can view at any angle without washout.  It's not a touchscreen like my other ASUS, but the touchpad is smart.  I can move about the screen, pinch, and scroll just by swiping my fingers.  If I need to type, the keys are comfortably spaced, although I don't find myself typing much on my laptops.<br/><br/>What about Windows 10?  It seems to be a combination of Windows 7 and 8.  Windows 7 is great for PCs.  Windows 8 is perfect for touchscreen laptops.  Windows 10 appears to satisfy both.  If you're worried, Zenbook boots into a screen that looks a lot like Windows 7, but we can pull up the tiles, if we want.  I like it.<br/><br/>Like many people I know, I mostly use my new laptop to surf the web, check email, and play Candy Crush online.  Okay, I'm not sure how many play Candy Crush.  The Wi-Fi connection is flawless, and I haven't had any issues with battery life (it runs at least 10 hours).<br/><br/>Of course, the laptop came with trials of this and that,  but they don't clutter up my desktop.  On the contrary, they are nicely packaged in one area, and I don't feel the need to clean them up because they don't feel like bloatware.  I even took McAfee up on its 30 day trial offer.  So far, so good.
The $699 price is truly remarkable considering it's predecessor, the UX303, cost $840. Out of the box the UX305 shines as an everyday thin and light notebook. My biggest con is the A/C adapter. The adapter "block" is too big and heavy. It tends to fall out of the wall socket. .
Very good ultrabook.  extremely light and very fast.  HATE Windows 8.  Hate all the preloaded advertising that pops up.  (I'm slowing deleting them when I find the time).<br/><br/>Would definitely purchase again.  If it weren't for the OS & ads, review would be a strong 5 stars.
It is great, fast and reliable. It is a really great feeling device. All aluminum, it has this rubber seal around the screen that makes a really satisfying noise when you close it.<br/><br/>Linux with no problem though it has UEFI which may be a problem for some distributions.
Great notebook to get some work done with no problems
Bought this for myself as a birthday present & it has replaced all of my other devices!  Love the fast boot up, the responsive trackpad but the speakers really could use an upgrade.  Overall one of my better purchases.
I've only had this laptop for a few days so don't expect a long term review but more of a first impressions pros and cons after extensively using it by someone really versed in computers.<br/><br/>I have just been blown away by this laptop in almost every way since I have received it. I purchased it off of the Microsoft Store for $600 and it is turning out to be the best laptop I have purchased EVER.<br/><br/>Let me start of with the pros. The processor works like a charm. A fanless laptop that hardly gets warm and has yet to have a hiccup. It is extremely light weight at just over 2.5 lbs, which feels like air when you carry or hold it up. Compared to my last laptop, which was relatively thick and heavy, this is like upgrading to the future. Another pro would be the screen. It is a crisp 1080p display with a matte finish giving it the ability to view outside with ease and all kinds of viewing angles. Lastly, what really stands out is the battery. Now while I haven't done tests, it has lasted me the better part of over 8 hours on a single charge with medium use, just unheard in some laptops. It may even last longer if I put it on battery saver. You get all of these pros in a nice aluminum finish case that is as thin as can be.<br/><br/>The only cons that I could find are minimal at best. Let's start off with the external speakers. They are just really low and soft sounding. But then again who uses their laptop speakers for anything meaningful? They do sound nice and the case states that it is B&O; technology, it is just low. And last would be the smudging. Since the laptop is made of premium materials, they supply a cloth to dust off smudges. I'm not OCD until it comes to smudges on my electronics so I use the cloth frequently.<br/><br/>All around solid laptop that is by far the best when you consider the price and quality. I have had time to compare this to the MacBook Air and while the MacBook does edge this ultrabook, it does not by much, and when considering the price, you are more than just getting a deal from this.
So lightweight, weighs less than my kindle
I Should start by saying that I had a HP laptop that was heavy and had the worst battery life. My needs were very specific : I needed a laptop that is extremely thin and light, that does not heat up to an uncomfortable level and that lasts me long. I was waiting for ASUS to release the LA version and bought it the day it was first made available.<br/><br/>Everything about the laptop screams quality. The build quality is top notch and so is the battery life. The keyboard is decent, nothing to write home about and the trackpad is more than adequate for all the multi-touch and scrolling gestures one would typically need. However, on a dark, fully-black screen you can see light bleed from the edges. This is a very minor annoyance and would only matter only if you are looking for it and being nit-picky. More than satisfied with the purchase. If you guys have any questions, let me know and ill try my best to answer them since I have been using this machine for almost a month now.
I missed only the keyboard back-light ...
A sleek and reliable machine. Very lightweight and fast for schoolwork and daily computer needs. Exactly what I wanted in a laptop. Once again, Asus has designed a quality product at a decent price.
For me, UX305 is the perfect one for your daily use (not for heavy use like gaming).<br/>Please be noted the classic envelop is not provided this time, this is the only thing I am not happy...
Computer starts up quickly and works well for my purposes (email and streaming video).  However, the speakers are utter garbage, you can barely hear anything even with the volume at 100%.
Excellent purchase very fast light and easy to use<br/>I've seen some reviews complaining about keyboard the delete key I wrong place this is nonsense<br/>Awesome product for the price
So far this laptop is pretty good. It is really light and thin which is fantastic and it looks pretty slick also. The keyboard is great and feels just like the one on Macbooks. The track pad is that smooth and there is a louder clicking noise when you click on it. One complaint I have is that the AC adapter for it is so short! They have made it similar to the Macbook one in the sense that it has the square-ish part that connects to the outlet, but Macbooks come with the longer extension cables. This laptop does not! So the cable is extremely short which isn't ideal. Another thing to note is on the description of the product at the top, it says 1 HDMI port. This is wrong! It has 1 MICRO-HDMI port. This is listed correctly later on in the longer description but can be misleading for potential buyers since HDMI is much more conventional than micro-HDMI, which can be a deal breaker for people.
It's an absolute perfection. Beats the apple. Fast, slim, beautiful, long lasting battery. And support light!<br/>Only default is the missing backlighting of the keyboard. Sound is OK.
Everything is great about this laptop!
Good machine... Good performance ...
Quiet, fast, sturdy, stylish, nice ports, and a good deal.<br/>Tip: I recommend the micro hdmi converter for presentations, streaming to TVs, and external monitors.
My wife loves this computer. Its fast and just works. battery life is great. wish it had a back light on the keyboard but not a big deal. great computer! so tiny.
I got this zenbook labtop about 7 months ago. I liked the look, and light-weight, of course, the low price. But recently, I have found some issues, got me concerned about the quality of the product.<br/>1. from time to time, my IE (internet explorer) will show complete blank, when that happens, even I go to another website, it's still blank. I don't know what happened, chrome seems to be fine. But it got me wonder about the QA process of Asus products.<br/>2. I just bought this Sony Bluetooth speaker (shaped like a tennis ball), and I have difficulty connecting to it. my wife's Apple Mac Air was able to connect to it right away. And that gave her a chance to brag about her hardware electronics skill over me. That hurts! Because, if it's not hardware electronics skill, It's definitely my hardware purchase skill!!<br/>3. So I connected the Sony speaker with a audio cable, at least that worked, but I heard this intermittent noise. I thought it's the speaker, but when I disconnected it, I found it's the PC itself! I tried two different video source on the internet, both got the same noise. Once I restart the PC, the problem was gone. But this experience again gave me a bad feeling about this Zenbook.<br/><br/>Will have to wait and see, I will do more extensive testing on this device. Can't trust Asus no more.
Fully satisfied with this laptop
Just opened it and it's gorgeous
Does the job but not so smooth as the specifications indicate. The display is not crisp and the touchpad is not fluidic. Still, best value for money.
I love this laptop.  It's thin, light and tons of memory.  Easy to carry, it runs quickly, internet pages load quickly...biggest bang for your bucks
Pros: fast, lightweight, quiet, nice solid feel, loud speakers<br/><br/>Drawbacks: no backlit keyboard
Very light and convenient. I only use it for streaming and occasional light gaming and it works nicely.
My biggest concern was if the core M processor would be enough. I really only use this to access the web, read email, watch a few videos and use a few MS Office products. After 10 days of use there is plenty of power for casual users. It comes out of sleep mode in a couple of seconds, a reboot is around 10 seconds. The track-pad works fine, yes the left and right "buttons" are a little noisy but it's the way it was designed and I'm getting used to it. The only thing that bugs me is the home/end/up/down keys; if you want to go to the top or bottom of a page you can't just hit the key - you have to hold the function key down. I miss the home/end keys but I'm getting used to it.<br/><br/>I didn't have any problems "out of the box" and I installed Windows 10 the same day I got it. It's doing what I wanted at a pretty good price and I'm pretty happy with it.
Excellent product, slight odd scaling for icons and finicky trackpad but flawless in any other way.
This is the best computer I have ever seen or used!! The speakers are amazing and work perfectly!!
The Zenbook was very light, sleek, quick and easy to set up. It has become my favorite new toy.
completely satisfied
Super Item! Love it!
Great piece of equipment. I recommend it to any one needing to do school or business work
Cons- 1) Gets really hot when streaming 480p video on YouTube after 5 mins of streaming. Cant keep it on lap. 2) Track pad is not sensitive enough. Tough to fine control. No software to enhance the sensitivity of track pad. Does not support the bandwidth of att wireless modem. I needed to buy separate USB adapter to get wireless connectivity at home. It worked fine on other public networks though.
I wanted to like this laptop so much, but in the end I had to return it due to a possible defect inherent in every Zenbook.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Light, looks great, non-glossy monitor, 8 gb RAM, SSD instead of HDD, good battery life, good keyboard.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Core M-5Y10 processor has its limits. It's a fast laptop for sure, but everything feels clunky, especially when I had a few programs running at the same time/in the background. For example, if you're just typing on Word or doing a Powerpoint, the laptop will run pretty smoothly. If you're running Word and browsing Google Chrome with a few tabs open while listening to music on Spotify, the laptop will run really slow and the bottom side will get really hot.<br/><br/>Speaking of Spotify, the Zenbook's speakers are tiny. I had to crank the volume up to 100 to get a reasonable sound. Headphones are a must.<br/><br/>The mousepad is unresponsive and awkward.<br/><br/>Comes with a ton of bloatware. I would recommend reinstalling Windows as soon as you get it out of the box.<br/><br/>Finally, the Zenbook's wifi problems put the nail in the coffin for me. Zenbooks come with Intel Wireless-N 7265 adapters. These wireless adapters have been known to cause problems. For me, the wifi worked beautifully for a few days. Then one day it just stopped working. It would connect for a couple of minutes, disconnect randomly for a few minutes, connect again for another few minutes, disconnect again, and so on. It became unusable for me as it would fail to stay connected for even 5 minutes. This is an issue with the wireless adapter it was installed with. I've contacted Intel, browsed forums for answers, turned off Bluetooth, and even tried reinstalling the adapter drivers. But Intel doesn't seem to care (they've had complaints about this problem in the past and they've done nothing about it to this day), forum solutions don't work, turning off Bluetooth only works for some people, and reinstalling drivers did nothing. I ended up returning the laptop to Amazon and will not be repurchasing it.<br/><br/>Final thoughts:<br/>The Zenbook is pretty good considering its price tag, but Asus took some shortcuts to get there: CPU, mousepad, speakers, and poorly made wifi adapter. The wifi problem alone is enough to kill this laptop, and the chances are just not worth taking.<br/><br/>Unless you're in love with Windows or hate Apple products with irrational passion, you're better off spending a bit more for the Macbook Air. I've had my Macbook Air for 2 years and it still runs beautifully without hiccup. This laptop died on me after a week.
I think I got a bunk one. Such a bummer, it seems people either really like this one, or it's awful. It just feels incredibly CHEAP. Mine just arrived today and I already know, after taking all these hours to get it set up and files transferred over, that I'm going to have to return.<br/><br/>The problems:<br/>- Windows will just randomly pop up (not internet windows/pop up ads, etc), and there is no possible way to close them except to shut off the computer. For example, a window with a "tip" for how to use the computer, will pop up...and there is no possible way of closing it. I had two other people play around and try to figure out how to close it, and none of us could. So I finally just had to turn the computer off with the button, because I couldn't even use the shut down option because the window was covering it up!!!  Also, if you just scroll your mouse over an area while passing over to get somewhere else, a window might pop up that IS possible to close...but now you have to go back over and click it closed because it's not a window you wanted open.  Very disruptive to work.<br/>- The screen resolution is pretty bad...not always, but in some windows the text will even be fuzzy, like it's one of the those old dinosaur computers from before laptops even existed. I know the monitor has something special about it prevent glare, but it's beyond just what that could be affecting, because some of the text will be crystal clear, and then just next to it it will be fuzzy, like if it was any worse it would literally start being blurry.<br/>- The monitor has something wrong with it: When I'm on a website, I can see the pages that are behind it, showing through. I can actually read text from websites that are open on tabs behind the website I'm currently on. And file icons from the desktop show up through web pages or whatever window I have open.  Also, there are horrible streaking lines going across the screen when you have a site or image up that is solid color. For example, my website has large blocks of color framing the two sides, and there are paler and darker lines streaking through the entire thing.<br/><br/>The pros:<br/>- Very light<br/>- Very sleek design.<br/>- Beautiful outside casing (whatever that's called). It's kind of a metallic bronzy brown color.<br/>- Very fast file transferring/copying. I transferred over 10,000 songs from my external hard drive...something that would have taken AT LEAST half an hour on any other computer I've ever had...and it was done in only seeming minutes. Same thing for 15 years of pictures, and some videos. Just very fast file copying.<br/>- So quiet! Makes no sound at all when it's on.<br/><br/>Such a bummer...I'm sure many people love this little machine, but just know you are definitely taking a risk with this one. For the price, NOT being a budget laptop, I expect much better performance than this.
In short, I love everything about the Zenbook except the touchpad and lack of keyboard backlighting. I knew it didn't have backlighting going in, but I didn't know the touchpad would be as bad as it is. If you only use a wireless USB mouse, it's a non-issue. The Zenbook still gets 5 stars from me (the touchpad notwithstanding) as it's just an exceptional ultrabook for the price.
The screen is not as good as reviewed, but it seems solid and reliable for the price
Great computer - good balance of speed, price and battery life. I'm very pleased.
This is a great product, near-perfect. I managed to buy the limited-edition UX305 that came with a 512GB SSD, Intel Core M 5Y71 and 3,200 x 1,800 matte IPS screen. The display was absolutely stunning though a few applications like Eclipse IDE weren't able to handle such high resolutions and rendered very tiny icons. I'm sure this won't be an issue with the regular UX305.<br/>This laptop is solid-state! How often do you get that? The completely noiseless operation makes using this laptop a pleasure.<br/>I have no regrets whatsoever in buying this piece of art. I've done my research (over 1 year) thoroughly and you can see the result! I absolutely love this beauty.
Pros:<br/>--Very light<br/>--Excellent matte display with high resolution (actually I was able to purchase the 3,200 x 1,800  resolution version in another country and scaling down to 1600x900 wasn't bad at all probably because the scaling factor is an exact integer)<br/>--Very fast boot time (even though I despise the Windows 8.1 user interface and installed an alternative start menu program)<br/>--Still a fast computer<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>– Being used to a Thinkpad keyboard, I find my self making more typing mistakes on the Asus UX305 because of the shallower travel, but maybe users experienced with shallower keyboards won't find this to be much of a problem.<br/>– When using youtube for the sole purpose of playing music, the music stutters ten minutes after the lid is placed down.  Not sure if this is a sign of overheating or system power setting issue<br/>– Coil whine/hum: put your ears near the place where the power cable connects to the computer.  If set your computer to sleep mode, you will hear a very apparent high pitched hum.  If you set your computer to hibernate mode or turned off, you will hear a somewhat less apparent high pitched hum unless you disconnect the power cable from the computer.  When the computer is on, there's still a noise in the area, but it's not apparent at all from a distance.<br/><br/>Looks like I'll have my unit serviced because I'm uncomfortable with the hum.  My other laptop doesn't have such hum when it is in sleep, hibernation, or off mode.
Perfect for students, light, functions great, high quality of product
Light and portable. Excellent quality computer at an excellent price.
Excellent laptop at a reasonable price.  I can heartily recommend it.
Pros:<br/>1. Super slim<br/>2. Same light as a MacBook<br/>3. Unbeatable Price on what it gives<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1. The Sound of mouse pad click is kind of cheap but totally acceptable<br/>2. The rebate instruction is not very clear<br/><br/>Best Ultra Book at this price level. Used it for a month. Everything runs greatly. MacBook, which cost around USD400 does not even got a USB plug-in, which is to portable to a point that is useless and no point, so I go for this ASUS UX305. Unbeatable for its price/utility ratio. A practical choice. Happy with it.
Just what I needed and works great. Light weight for traveling.
I gave it two stars because the price seemed good for a portable laptop. But those benefits are frequently moot because connectivity is so unreliable. I've yet to find any rhyme or reason to why it refuses to connect to new networks or suddenly drops known networks. I can't rely on it to keep me connected (whether wireless or ethernet). In addition, I've found the touchpad awkward. Also, I've had it for almost four months and am beginning to experience issues with the display - random parts of the screen black out from time to time.
The computer worked well for about 5 weeks. I have had the Zen book for 4 /12 weeks before the corner of the  display frame began to crumple and grind against the body. The aluminum is now dis formed and  grinds against the sides whenever i open the computer
Laptop very slim and lightweight, I don't give 5 stars because by opening the lid its bottom part touches the surface which is a very lame engineering mistake. People who read this you are lucky because post reading many reviews this never came up!!
I am really happy, it is very easy to use and very light
Amazingly fast with a 256SSD and it is value for money.
Great computer, best one I have owned! fast delivery!
Best deal on a laptop for everyday web applications.
Great aluminium body, work great, fantastic screen.
Everything I wanted! I read hundreds of reviews before making this purchase.  I wanted a laptop that was sleek, light weight, and efficient.  I use it for research, school work, communication, and coding for data analysis.  It performs wonderfully for all of these tasks.  Read previous reviews for very detailed information.  The only thing I wish it had that it doesn't is a scroll option on the touchpad.
Purchased for my son to take to college. It's lightweight and the body structure is more than stable, it's son proof! Speed is great, the backlit keyboard is a plus, teens like to work in the dark.....do know there are no programs with it. Have to purchase office programs separate. I was able to link my office account to include my son's email and he had 0 issues downloading and using it.
Excellent portable machine. Only had it a few days, but it's done everything I've needed (word processing, media streaming, web browsing). Very aesthetically pleasing and light as well - meets all my expectations.<br/><br/>Only issue is that the screen seems to go back and forth between dim and bright - not sure if there's a weird setting going on or an issue with the display function.
Light , fast I'm still tring to master 8.1
Love this laptop. I use it in college and it is so light, I don't have trouble carrying it around anywhere. I bought a wireless mouse to use instead of the pad on the laptop itself because it's a loud click when you use it but it doesn't bother me. I also bought a cd drive as the computer does not come with one. Love the style and capability that this laptop has. Great price.
Very nice laptop, great dispay, very thin
very convenient for student！！very light！
very good
Excellent
Excellent
I'm a Mac person, and this was my first computer outside of the MacBook line.  I am a grad student and needed to download SAS, a data coding program so I got a PC.  There are some nice qualities about this computer, but the issues (Wi-Fi) outweigh the benefits, sad to say...<br/><br/>Internet quits out randomly and will not reconnect - during the same time, my phone and roommate's computers do not lose internet.  I have restarted the router, and taken the advice of the IT Crowd by "turning it off and on again" to no avail.  Even sitting right next to the router, the internet does not reconnect.  This has happened with multiple routers in multiple locations.  Even after I restarted the router, the Wi-Fi wouldn't show up, or after FIVE MINUTES it would show up again but the computer wouldn't automatically connect.<br/><br/>Also, internet is very slow and usually shows a "webpage is not responding" message, and takes from five to ten seconds to load pages without multimedia.  On more than one occasion, I have been watching Netflix without any other tabs open or programs running, and the video froze for about ten seconds, or the sound quit out, or the program itself froze and the screen went black and I had to restart the computer.<br/><br/>SOME PROS:<br/>- EXCELLENT battery life (7-8 hrs without battery saver mode)<br/>- Silent, no fan sound, doesn't heat up at all, brightness and screen good quality
Zero stars. I cannot connect to my recently purchased HP printer (need to download an app that wasn't required for any other laptop I connected to) nor my Microsoft account (invalid account - what?), both of which I was easily able to download and connect to on my boyfriend's Lenovo, and two Dell laptops. What good is a Zenbook when I cannot use it for my school work???<br/>Nice robust exterior, speedy processor but that is where the romance ends. Worthless in attempting to connect to a school Microsoft account and worthless in connecting to my printer, wouldn't even load the page to download my printer, although my printer shows in the printer list.
gift I will know more in a few weeks
nice and light performance seem ok.
When the Mac Book Air's first came out I instantly fell in love with them. They were so light, so slick looking, and thin enough that you could fit them in a folder! How cool is that? These laptops, I feel, are built just as well as the Mac Books, but are literally half the price. The keyboard is great, the battery life will give you 7-9 hours of web browsing easy, I love that ASUS was able to pack in three usb 3.0 ports. I love having such a thin, light, machine that is still more than powerful enough for running virtual machines. All the hardware is great for the price point, wireless AC, 256gb ssd, etc. Thanks to the AC wireless, and steam in home streaming, I'm able to play games like Crysis, and GTA IV all over campus on a 2.5 lb laptop from my big rig in my dorm room. It's easy enough to open and replace the SSD, wifi card, battery. And there's not even a need to clean the insides because there's no fans! I'll probably never actually have to open it! My biggest issue though, while running CPU intensive tasks and simultaneously charging this thing will get hot to the touch. The CPU doesn't get even close to the shutdown/throttle point, but the bottom of the body will get hot, a cooling pad is recommended. Overall; Love Love Love this laptop!
Despite it's lightweight (due to a reduced battery) and aluminium there are few critical issues that made me return it.<br/>First and the most important: the display mount is really loose. A small movement might even close the lid, it almost doesn't hold it, and it pisses off a big time. It's crucial for a mobile laptops that the mount is screwed tight and holds the screen position firmly. 1 star off. The second is the battery life. I understand they wanted to reduce the price and the weight this way, but it was too much. The best I could squeeze out of the battery was 3-4 hours, that is just internet browsing (I never had anything close to the 7 hours they promise). 2 star off. The third is that "power" button placement. It's ridiculous. As someone who works a lot with documents (and press "delete" quite often) I had a real hard time re-learning not to press the power button instead of delete (and then I had to re-learn it back once again). Here goes the third star. Also, the laptop storage is split into two drives, one is SSD and the other is HDD obviously, another thing that let them keep the price low.<br/><br/>Eventually I bought refurbished macbook air for $180 more, and I'm much more satisfied with it.
Runs well. Web browsing is slower than it should be across the board on Chrome, ie, and FireFox. Failed to connect to wi-fi at a few places but works at home. Super light which is great. Charge holds as advertised. Mouse clicking is loud.<br/><br/>Updating this review after having this machine for a couple of months. The wifi speed make me want to through this thing at the wall. I replaced my old machine because I was looking for faster processing and web browsing. Runs great hard-lined but they seriously need to come out with a driver update for the wifi card.
I did a lot of research before buying this, as I always do. This is the best ultrabook for this price, even until now. So price vs product wise, you're getting a good deal.<br/><br/>Was pretty sad that the price dropped right after I bought it. Was too late since it shipped before I noticed.
Great notebook, great keyboard for writers, and fantasticl screen without the glare. Windows 10 easy to install, everything worked out of the box. It's super light, super intuitive, and my new best friend. Shipped without problems, and had to laugh at the extra care with which it was packed.
I'm in between 4 and 5 stars, so I'll round up. My only real complaint, which is more of a warning is that this computer comes running Windows 10, not 8.1 as it is in the description!! It says free upgrade, so I took that to mean it would be an option to upgrade later, or at the very least, would let me revert to 8.1, which it doesn't! I have a work program that I thought needed 8.1, but it turns out it will allow 10 now, so it's not a problem, but if you need Windows 8.1, do not get this laptop.<br/>With that said, this is a beautiful machine. It is almost impossibly thin and light. Seriously, I'm not sure how something this powerful is running in this package. I love the dark gray color with the pretty swirly brushed look on the outside. The matte screen is so comforting to my eyes which are used to a horrible glare from my previous glossy laptop screen. The mousepad is a little loose feeling and noisy, but I got used to it easily. I might find myself missing the numeric keypad, but there's no way to fit it without shrinking down the keyboard too much. I haven't had it long enough to assess the battery life, but the start up from sleep mode is very quick just like it says.
It's awesome, like it very much
5 stars for the computer.  Light, very fast, and silent operation.  Battery life is phenomenal.  10 - 12 hours depending on how you use it.  Wish the SSD was a bit larger but an external is always available.  No stars for Windows 10. It is an abomination.  Constant interference from the os to "help" you with various tasks.  You can give up your life and data to Microsoft for the convenience of having everything in one place.  Wow, one less button to push.  The real annoyance is in the details.  Go try to drag something from your screen to the desktop.  Isn't gonna happen.  Go try to highlight a portion of a page and print it.  Ain't gonna happen.  Go try to 2 or 3 pages of an email.  No again.  But you can tell it to print the page you are on instead of all of them.  What a fantastic improvement over windows 7.  Can you hear my sarcasm?  I can go on but the good news is that IE 10 or 11 is imbedded in the os and you can switch to it which will allow the drag and drop features.  And if you have a prior windows password, say for Hotmail, you will end up using it to boot up (like I did) if you are not careful in you choices when booting for the first time.
Wow super happy, mora that I expected, fast, ultra thin, the battery really last 10 hrs. I'm really happy with my new computer
Light, fast, strong. Multi touch keypad is sweet. Keyboard feels hella good. Love the 3 usb ports + hdmi + headphone jack.
Wifi adapter was dead on arrival. Or just got a defective laptop. Bought from asus store. Returning.<br/>Impossible to use laptop without wifi. Sad. Though the shape of this laptop is sleek and thin.
Laptop has been everything that I wanted. I spent $1800 for my previous laptop and it had issues right away and was very big and heavy. This laptop is incredibly fast still (after 6 months) and still has great battery life. for $700, it is a steal.
Beautifully made. Wish it came with Windows 7 instead of 8, but it's speedy and handsome and a joy to carry.
Great, sleek and very slim computer! It's great that I don't have to carry around a bulky laptop like most of the students here without it being a new expensive MacBook. Only slight problem are the speakers, but other than that, gold!
Amazingly lightweight.  Have only been using for a couple of weeks but appears to be a quality system.
i love the its pretty shape,and thin body,the most important is that i ve got 50% discount here than my country. UX305LA would be perfect if win10 has a good compatibility for the FULL HD scream,and a promoted TouchPad.
I've had my zenbook for a few days now and so far I'm quite happy. I've had the display driver crash a few times, usually when watching a video, which is less than ideal. My main problem is with the 1-year "accidental damage protection", which as far as I can tell is impossible to register for. I've been trying Asus' page for it for a few days now and it 404's whenever I click "activate protection". When I tried sending a message to Asus about it their message service also failed to function, so that was uninspiring. Overall I figure that, like Asus products I've had before, that hardware will be fantastic but any "services" offered are illusory.
Background:<br/>As a corporate guy, I go through lots of Windows laptops at work.  They are all black, big-brand machines which are heavy and expensive for their segment.  So at home, obviously, I use a 13" MacBook Air which is the opposite of that.  I've been using my 2013 model for a few years.  It still runs like a new machine, and I really like it.<br/><br/>This laptop is a nicely executed MacBook copy. It's solidly built, while being lighter and faster with a better screen. There was some cost cutting in the hinge, touchpad, and especially the charging cord, but nothing that I really notice. This is a nice looking knockoff for sure.<br/><br/>This Windows 10 computer is also pretty fast with an 800 MHz - 2 GHz processor and 8GB RAM.  I get the latest licenses for MS office from work, and my most mind-boggling spreadsheets crunch pretty fast. I can also play a game if I want. Fallout New Vegas is loaded on the machine right now, and it runs really nicely with all graphics settings maxed out.<br/><br/>This is a great alternative to a used Mac if you like the look but don't like OSX.
Literally takes 3 seconds to boot up.<br/>It's fast, slim, and sweet!
I liked the computer 'til I started having some glitches. I would have tried to work them out but ASUS scammed me with the rebate. I sent in ALL documentation they asked for, including a copy of the Amazon invoice. They declined the rebate, saying "Required Documentation missing-Copy of Clear or Legible Receipt/Invoice or Packing ListInvalid Retailer - The retailer provided is not eligible for this promotion." I'd probably keep the computer if Amazon would get me the rebate but I can't find any way to contact Amazon about this. This situation doesn't fit their categories.
Arrived with no Network WiFi adaptors installed.  Spent 2 hours with ASUS support to no avail.  Returned the next day for a refund.
This is my first netbook, I'm reasonably impressed by it's glare free screen, sensitive touch pad, fast response time, 3.0 USB and long battery life. The pre-loaded Windows 10 is so much easier to use than Windows 8.X, but on my important work tasks I still resort to my laptop with Windows 7 Pro. I'm getting used to "the cloud" and not having all those extra slots for CD-RW  etc and actual restore disks or other restore media.<br/><br/>Nice and lightweight for this noob to the cloud.<br/><br/>UPDATE 10/17/2015:  It runs a little hot and will lock up after lengthy usage. If you plan using it a few hours at a clip you need a chill-mat or something to keep the vents clear. I don't recall hearing a fan kick on.
Still amazed at how thin and light it is.  Yet the aluminum case is very sturdy.  I've been very pleased with this item so far.
Realy nice, low weight, not a speedster but not slow.  The trackpad click volume is way too loud but otherwise a great machine.
Fast,  sleek,  and light. Low profile.  I love it.
I just purchased this machine and love the look and feel.  It works great when I am working on AC power.  When i unplug the machine and work off of battery power, the machine slows to a crawl.  Web browsing is impossible and everything takes minutes to open.  ASUS tech support is useless.  I have refreshed the machine, installed all the updates and re-installed windows to no avail.<br/><br/>I dont know if others experience the same issues but I am hoping its this machine.
Great product
With the proper operating system, this ASUS Zenbook shines.  The display is clear, bright, and sharp over a wide range of viewing angles.  Sound reproduction is adequate, quite amazing timbre from such a thin case.  Battery life is dependent on app load, but will satisfy most users with a nominal 6 hours.  The SSD drive seems smallish, but for recreational use it will service your needs.  Wireless connectivity is a breeze to set up and maintain.  The ASUS is so light in weight, it can be carried anywhere, and it won't give you eyestrain staring at tiny 4-inch screens.  About the only caveat is the POWER switch key, located on the far right-hand side of the keyboard; it is possible to switch OFF by accident, thus losing all your work, unsaved.<br/><br/>You get all this while running LINUX off a bootable thumb drive.  This review actually is a commentary of Win8/10 and the suspected effects on SSD drives, the dreaded DPC_Watchdog_Violation.  This blue-screen-of-death issue occurs in laptops with standard hard drives, but solid state drives (SSD) seem to aggravate the issue.<br/><br/>The typical culprits are display driver incompatibilities, though practically any added device in the USB chain can trigger the mutt violation.  The<br/>suggested fix is re-installation of display and/or device drivers.  However, the fix is only temporary; the problem will re-occur, sometimes within a<br/>few days of applying the supposed cure.<br/><br/>The only permanent solution appears to be switching from Win8/10 to Fedora or Ubuntu.  Either one will tame the mutt permanently.  It you have<br/>never tried a LINUX distribution, try booting from a thumb drive carrying a LINUX flavor.  There will be sufficient space on the SSD drive to<br/>house Win10 and much more useful LINUX.<br/><br/>Thumbs down on any device running Win10.  The DPC Watchdog Violation issue almost drove me to a Mac, after thirty years of loyalty to DOS and Windows.
Very quiet, cool, and easy to use.<br/>However, it does say that it has a 170 degree angle, but it's definitely nowhere near that. It can only angle up to ~130 degrees, which actually bothered me a bit.<br/>The fonts on some of the pages, especially demanding pages/apps/etc seem to be blurry and low-quality.<br/>For a zenbook, I didn't expect these minor problems to occur.<br/>Still, it's literally silent, cool, and has a very long battery life.
Great value!
The price dropped twice within one month. Over all this is a great ultrabook for student and minor gamer~
Absolutely love my new Zenbook! It's not the most powerful computer available but it was never meant to be. It runs the entire Office suite without any issues and the battery lasts 8-10+ hrs depending on what I'm working on. On top of that, this thing is practically a feather. Great notebook for anyone who is on the go and needs a lightweight machine that will last most of the day.
Very good product, first time I think I got a notebook than Sony VAIO, it trashed the Sony VAIOs.
Very pleased with this little computer. Fast, lightweight, clear and vibrant screen, ease of use.
Excellent!
An affordable competitor to the macbook air. the perfect non-Apple 13-inch laptop from ASUS.
good laptop from Asus which strikes a balance between affordability and processing power.
Got it for my brother. He loves it!! Very thin and light. Perfect to take it to school.
I got this to replace an older 11.6" Acer Aspire 1410 for my wife. She insists on lightweight so she can take it wherever she goes. This computer is excellent - extremely lightweight for the screen size, beautiful display, and plenty fast (given the large amount of RAM and SSD). The processor is certainly not the fastest, but good enough for web browsing, MS Office, Kindle, music, video, etc. Construction is solid. The laptop fits easily in Amazon's 13" laptop sleeve. It comes with a USB-Ethernet port adapter.<br/><br/>A few minor cons (and hence the 4 stars): It may be slightly hard to open for those with "fat fingers" - the lid overlaps the bottom a bit, so there's no clear leverage when opening the lid in the front. There is no dedicated number keypad. The battery is not swappable. The plug is located directly on the power brick, so you need extra room on the power strip to plug it in.<br/><br/>Summary: The price is superb for what you get with this laptop and I would definitely get it again. (I have a MS Surface Pro 3 that is blazingly fast, but almost twice the cost.)
As advertised. I received the signature edition with no USB to Ethernet dongle. My graphics card crashed once or twice (no big deal), but other than that it has been more than enough for my needs. It was this or the Dell XPS, but with the price difference, this is a deal that cannot be beaten.
Love it!
Have had this for a few months now; typing the review on it.  Great laptop.
Fantastic laptop. Slim but strong. No complaints so far in a month of use.
Great fast laptop for my kid for school. Durable and compact.  He loves it
Good product, received fast, solid packaging, perform good as expected.
Perfect
The laptop arrived without issue, but the software was broken right out of the box!!! The laptop breaks upon booting and shuts down. Hopefully, this is an isolated incident. Will change this review if the replacement works as intended...
It's light, compact and user friendly.  Fits my need perfectly.
Amazing laptop. Totally recommended, not one complaint yet :D
I have had this laptop for around 4 months now<br/>Pros<br/>-Great for taking notes in class<br/>-Super light weight<br/>-Capable of playing LoL on med-low settings with very rare frame rate lag<br/>-Looks sharp
Very nice! Beautiful design, and every component go with it.
Although I haven't had it for long, I'm quite happy with what I've seen so far. The design is sleek and stylish, which is something that I was looking for after having a fairly large and clunky HP laptop until now.
I've only had this laptop for about 2 weeks, but i already LOVE it! Super thin and light. Battery lasts relatively long for how tiny this thing is. Really fast and the mouse pad is really responsive.  No cons yet.
Great!
Great laptop my son just wishes it had a light up keyboard.
Light weight and long life battery.....what's not to like.
Slim pretty but a little bit of a fuzzy picture sometimes
I LOVE THIS ZEN BOOK IT'S MY TOY AND MY BABY LOVE LOVE IT
Have needed a light laptop for quite a while for travel and decided to go with this one.<br/><br/>It had Windows 8.1 (I'm a 7 user) which I was not accustomed to. I was not able to connect to our home wifi, although I could see it. After a call with Amazon customer support then a 2.5 hr call with ASUS customer support (where we did lots of steps, lots of loading things, etc etc), we discovered I couldn't connect to our home wifi. I had another laptop up at the time and of course it connected perfectly. Very odd. No one has ever had a problem with our wifi. ASUS rep said to send it to them and they'd look at it. But I decided to return it to Amazon Prime instead, got a full refund, and just bought a Dell XPS 13, which I love (so far!). It instantly connected to our wifi. As expected! I don't usually send new defective things for fixing. It suggests QC issue. Who knows what else is wrong??
Works well. Fires up instantly. I do wish that the screen hinge went back further. Not a huge deal, but a few more degrees would be nice when using it on a counter or lying in bed.
Great purchase.  It is still performing as expected
Everything is good except that the four stands are not on the same horizontal plane when the lid is opened so it will sway a little bit. But this does not cause much annoy to me
I ended up having to return this computer because the micro HDMI port didn't work. It seems I am not the only one that has had this issue. Otherwise it was a nice computer.
So far so good for this laptop. Great investment
I bought this for my 16 yr old. She loves it.
You have the tech specs above, and plenty of folks have commented on the functionality (components/hardware & OS) of this laptop, so I'll spare you this, but wanted to add my $.02:<br/><br/>~The complaints about the keyboard are legit: it really does suck. Sometimes you have to hit keys twice to get them to register. Ugh. I don't know if the keys are just too slim/low or what, but it's really a problem. I hate that I have to retype certain things over, and if my palm accidentally grazes the touchpad, I end up somewhere else on the page and need to backtrack. Yeah, User Error, no doubt, but still...we're using this on our laps, and that unstable, squishy surface doesn't lend itself to the utility of this keyboard.<br/><br/>~Similarly, the touchpad is kind of a pain to use: I hate it for scrolling, as it takes huge effort to do (why can't they function like a mouse, allowing you to "grab" the scrollbar with a click/release and swipe down, rather than having to keep the touchpad held down?).<br/><br/>~The display out of the box has a scratch on the screen, and I'm not sure if I did this or someone in my family, but we're pretty careful with technology, so I'm guessing the thing scratches pretty easily.<br/><br/>Other than these peeves, this is a pretty decent laptop, functioning as expected. It'd be nice if didn't come loaded with throwaway apps and came with some useful software, but that's probably too much to ask.
Nice
Laptop arrived with a fault kept crashing so had to send it back. Amazon where helpful but not impressed with Asus quality control.
Great laptop. Mouse is a bit noisy.
very good product. arrived on time.
The laptop is as good as expected,light and fast. But the only problem is where can I find the windows license key?
Nice laptop for student and pupil.
Great Quality, Nice Hardware setup
Great laptop, great battery life!
Nice and light. Does the job.
Definitely worth the money !!
A very good model and I like it very much. Will be using it for my travel to Hong Kong this May.
Ordered to take when traveling.  Awesome laptop.  Fast and good size but so light.  Perfect!
Great laptop for the money.
Lots of bang for your buck!
Very light, great graphics
AMAZING.  SIMPLY AMAZIN!!!
Best ultrabook I ever had
it fits me very well.it would be better if it get a backlight keyboard.
A few days later I received the Zenbook, there was a display issue.  The screen turned to black, everything stops for a min and turns back on the display.  I thought it was not going to be a big issue.  However, only a month later I bought this Zenbook, I have only used Zenbook for my school, the screen would not turn on.  The power button light was on, but nothing was displaying on it.  Sometimes Zenbook worked fine, so I kept it until today.  However, three days ago, my Zenbook's screen would not turn on at all! I contacted Asus service for a repair and now I am sending it to the repair center.  If I knew I was going to have a this big problem, I would have returned it before return policy ended.
Fast, slim, portable.
The zenbook work wonderfully. However initially I had issues connecting to my wifi home network through the at&t; uverse router.  After installing the massive number of updates for windows 7, the driver for the wireless card must have updated and now it works just fine.
The Asus ZenBook UX305 is a nice lightweight laptop for general everyday computer use. It works well for using office suites, browsing the internet, and other less intensive programs.<br/><br/> It uses an Intel i5 processor and eights gigs of ram with the solid state hard drive boot. It also comes with Windows 10 which makes a package with very quick boot times. It takes about five seconds to reach the windows nlogin screen from a powered off state.<br/><br/> The screen is 1080p and looks clear and vibrant. The touch pad is quick and responsive. The speakers are adequate for such a small package. The ZenBook also  is fairly quiet during use. Overall the Asus ZenBook UX305 is an extremely nice lightweight package for everyday use.
I notice quite a few people posting comments regarding issues with the micro-HDMI output on this machine. I very rarely post any kind of review but in this case I feel people should be warned!<br/><br/>With two different machines, having exchanged the first, I found that the output via HDMI to a second monitor (tested with AOC and JVC) was blurred - noticeably bad image quality especially with text in windows, browsers etc.<br/><br/>I don't have the same problem with my small ASUS X205T - it seems there is something poorly designed in the UX305 graphics module / HDMI output. ASUS tech support have not replied to me. If you use your machine with any kind of external display device, don't buy this!
Runs great (other than Win 8). The problem I have with it is the heat while charging. The battery gets very hot while charging. This makes me nervous so I try not and use it much while charging, which could be a major issue for some.
The laptop itself is awesome just as expected after extensive research done prior the purchase. On the other side I am very disappointed with Amazon deal and service as it turned out to be full of empty promises.
I've been a Macbook Pro user for over a decade, but getting another MBP as another computer seemed too pricey, so I was happy to receive the Zenbook UX305LA to review because I was looking for a PC laptop.<br/><br/>This looks a lot like Macbook Air. It works well, looks great and has good battery life, with a good amount of RAM and hard-drive capacity. However, it falls short in a few areas:<br/><br/>- The keyboard is not backlit. I didn't realize how crucial this feature was until I was typing in the dark.<br/>- The power button is the same size as the delete button which is located next to the power button. It has a small light, but it's easy to hit "delete" accidentally, especially when the keyboard is not backlit if you're typing in the dark.<br/>- (I use a laptop stand, so this isn't an issue.) The laptop's four corners have rubberized feet. Unfortunately, when the laptop is being used on a flat surface like a desk and is open a little beyond 90-degrees, the back/bottom part of the screen-containing lid lifts the back part of the Zenbook, so the rear two rubberized feet don't come in contact with the surface, i.e. only the front two rubberized feet keep it from moving around, which doesn't keep things as stable. This is a design flaw.<br/>- Opening the Zenbook takes some thought. There's no indentation to allow a good, easy position to lift up the screen/lid.<br/>- The touchpad takes a while to get used to. It's definitely different from Macbooks.<br/><br/>This isn't a negative - just an FYI: The Zenbook does NOT have a touchscreen.<br/><br/>The price is pretty good and much lower than a comparable Macbook Air. It works fine for today's computing needs, with everything being on cloud. If you plan on buying this, please be sure to familiarize yourself with an unlit keyboard. I didn't realize how annoying that'd be that I'd rather pay a bit more for that feature, even though I rarely type in a dark or semi-dark environment. With a backlit keyboard, this would be a solid 4-star machine, possibly 5 if the price stayed the same.
Tough cursor to control. Confusing screens. I like the size, weight, long lasting battery, but not easiest computer to figure things out on, even after some regular use and upgrading to Windows 10..
Pretty slow for an SSD equipped laptop.  Display is mediocre.  Would not buy again.  Person I bought it for doesn't use it.  Not sure if it's Windows 8.1 or the laptop.
It has some display problem. It has small blinking that bothers me all the time and if i stay on cer tain webpage for so long it marks on your background after awhile.
This is a laptop that is sized just right, nice and slim profile, right weight and very comfortable for travel.<br/><br/>Its view and performance are excellent.
Well, I bought this and it lasted about 8 hours.  I installed the Microsoft updates it said to.  Installed Evernote and Dropbox.  Then I noticed I had notifications in my taskbar that said I had to restart due to "disk errors".  So, like a wise person I restarted.  That was all she wrote.  Will not boot, refresh, system restore, boot in safe mode - nothing.  Totally useless.  Called ASUS and they said its over for it and just send it back.  Wow.
great machine.
This computer isn't horrible, however it is not great. For $699 the computer should be easy to use. The biggest issue I have with this laptop is the track pad. It is so bad, I mean unusable bad. I dread having to use my computer now because I know that the track pad will be such a hassle to use. I can barely track your movement, it's erratic and hard to control. Why you would think it is okay to have a track pad like this, I have no idea. This isn't a bottom of the line computer, this shouldn't be an issue. After having this computer for about a week I will probably end up returning it. I didn't buy a $699 laptop so that I could attach a mouse to it, and I don't think I can handle using the track pad for the next 3-4 years.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Thin, light<br/>8GB of ram, 256GB ssd<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Anything to do with the mouse. The clicker on the mouse pad is extremely loud and difficult to click. The track pad is a nightmare to use. Since you constantly use the mouse pad it is hard to ignore and deal with. I would not recommend this computer until they fix the track pad. I even though about sanding down the track pad in order to give my fingers more traction. YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DO THAT.
Everything about this laptop was great except for the trackpad. Compared to a Macbook Air, the screen was better, better specs, build quality was great, etc, except the trackpad. At first I thought I could live with it, adjusted the settings to use touch gestures, however it got worse with a few programs I tried. I wasn't able to transfer my Windows version of MS Office that I purchased less than a year ago. So, it made more sense for me to return it and get a refurbished Macbook Air 13. I just needed this for Office and internet access. Ironically, I had no problem transferring my Mac version of Office. So think I would have kept it if I could have used the Windows version of Office I paid for less than a year ago. Of if this had a decent trackpad I would have given it five stars. This is the second time in 3 years I have tried a windows laptop and the trackpad was a deal breaker, although it may be adequate for someone else, depending on what programs you use. It was disappointing because everything else was really good.
battery did not work , sent back and new one came right away, works as good as my macbook air but much cheaoer and it has touch screen
pretty good
ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE WITH THIS LAPTOP!!!! THE BEST EVER! REMINDS ME OF THE MACBOOK AIR EXCEPT BETTER!
Love it.
Light & quick.  Excellent value for money.  Delivered as promised
Needs some modification to software on arrival but runs quick.<br/><br/>Update 1: it's been a month using the Zenbook and I can't compare it to my last laptop. Quick for all uses (school work), silent and feels like a high end computer. I have not had an issue with the power button and delete button at all. I did change the function of the button if it is hit on accident.
Excellent laptop. Slim and beautiful. Does not have a CD unit.
EXPECTED A BIT BETTER BUT I GUESS FOR THE MONEY WAS EXCELLENT
Got the laptop 12 days back, today while using it, it got switched off. Not restarting after that, I have to send it to service center. Not a good experience at all.<br/><br/>EDIT:<br/><br/>Sent laptop to service center and they replaced the hard disk. So far working okay without any issue. It took around two weeks to get the laptop fixed.
Love the aesthetics of this unit but feel lack of control over particularly the use of the mouse. Three days out of the box and already had to send back to the factory for wireless card problems. Jury still out on this one. However, it is super fast. From clicking POWER button to full desktop probably about 15-20 seconds.
Good
Hard drive has to do a frequent recovery.  There are so many ways to access internet explorer and each one gives you different capabilities - it is frustrating.  The tool bars pop out irritatingly easy, but the minimize or close signs are hard to get to come up to activate.  Would not recommend.
Great laptop. Running Ubuntu 14.04 on it.
Great computer for the price! Sleek, lightweight and powerful enough for daily use. Tons of battery life. Unfortunately it is not user friendly when utilizing the Remote Desktop Connection feature.  The size of the fonts on the icons once connected fare extremely small. I spent hours on the phone with Microsoft trying to troubleshoot a solution with no success. For me the Remote Desktop is a necessity so I'm sadly returning the computer.  I've read the Surface Pros also have this issue and they have now developed a few fixes but unfortunately none of them worked on the Zenbook 305.
Nice product! Very good service!
Love it!  And what a great deal.
The sound is puny. It is not even adequate when you are alone in a quiet room.
oh the right-click, geeze
Great computer.  Fast.<br/>Blue tooth does not work well.
This is a good laptop if you can't afford a Macbook.  That's where the comparisons stop. This laptop is VERY slim. I spent the first couple of days with it, comparing it to various notebooks, and books around my apt. It's also easy to lose since it blends in with everything. I like that the charger is very portable. THis laptop does NOT handle photo software very well. Nor video software. I gave up trying to edit photos after the first try and now just use my old laptop or my desktop. SO basically this laptop is like a marathon runner, not a bodybuilder. Fast, but won't run graphics heavy programs (at all). so I should have spent a couple of hundred dollars more for ????
Just marvelous thing!
Great for the price.
The display driver has crashed 5 times.  I have only had the laptop for 2 days.  Not a happy customer.
The ZenBook UX305 stuns with a gorgeous all-aluminum body, a thin, fanless design, and 9-plus hours of battery life,<br/><br/>The Pros:<br/>Great price ; Superthin aluminum body ; Bright matte screen ; Quiet, fanless design ; Extra long battery life<br/><br/>The Cons:<br/>Quiet speakers ; No backlit keyboard; Webcam has poor white balance<br/><br/>A good ultra-slim laptop, but still playing catch up on others like this Dell shown here: http://amzn.to/18KDa81
I got this computer mid july and by September, it started giving me problems with the wifi. The wifi connectivity had a mind of its own and would work some days but not others. Come this week, it has completely stopped working. I cannot find any networks with the wifi adapter on my computer. Its a shame its a beauty to look at and really light, the wifi issue make it completely useless to get work done. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!
Very light weighted, but graphic resolution is low especially on webpages.  Somehow when browsing Internet the pages look as if I was reading a PDFs file. I don't know this is caused by the screen itself or the way it has been set up.I am not fan of windows 8.1  so it is taking a long time to get the computer set up and running. On the positive side it starts super fast compared to other pc, although still a bit slower than Mac
Great product !
Great computer.
Wireless constantly drops out. Adapter disconnects for no reason. Comes with Windows 8.1, which is impossible to use effectively (this PC does not have a touch screen).<br/><br/>Update: Asus customer service is very difficult to get hold of. When you finally get an RMA, they make the customer pay for the shipping.  Terrible company.  Will never buy Asus again.
I tried this and ended up returning it. It felt too delicate to me; I did not care for the seemingly flimsy keyboard. It seemed to work perfectly well, though, for what it is. Perhaps if you walk around a lot and you need a computer that is unbelievably lightweight, and don't plan on running many programs outside of Word and maybe some music, then I would recommend this device.
Don't purchase this laptop. This laptop does not have the specs I hoped for but anyways, I'll get to that later.<br/><br/>I usually don't do reviews, but this product + Amazon support has put through a lot of frustration that  I decided to write an HONEST review about this product.<br/><br/>Had I paid more attention to the specs, I wouldn't have purchased this product in the first place.<br/><br/>This laptop is the "UX305fa" model. There is another one that costs $50 more on amazon that is the "ux305la" model. For $50 more, you get an intel processor that is much better than the "Core M"<br/><br/>The Latest Intel processors go from best to least best in the following chronological order:<br/><br/>Intel I7, Intel I5 (This is what the UX305LA has), Intel I3, and the M core (What the UX305FA currently has). So hopefully this will convince you to add $50 more to get a processor that is WAY BETTER than that "FA" model.<br/><br/>Ok so the Pros/cons:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>Thin: Makes it very easy to carry around, especially since I am a college student.<br/>Battery Life: Works wonderful.<br/>Storage is of plenty<br/>Display is amazing<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Trackpad is noisy and sometimes clumsy. I use a logitech remote bluetooth mouse to solve the issue.<br/><br/>-USB port does not recognize devices. Connects/disconnects simultaneously. This is an issue that other have experienced as well. There are 3 usb 3.0 drives: two on the left and one on the right. The one on the right fails to work properly. The other two cause more issue because they do not allow file transfer properly. I send a file over and it says USB device is disconnected.<br/><br/>-No backlit keyboard. C'mon, for this price a back-lit keyboard is a must.<br/><br/>-Windows 10 has been causing graphics driver crashed when not plugged in charging. I updated the driver and hope that this issue has been resolved.<br/><br/>Overall, this laptop is convenient if it didn't have so many defects. I honestly suggest everyone look into the "LA" model, since it has better specs for only $50 more.
It's perfect
Laptop performance is fair. Service from ASUS is sub par.<br/>Part of the machine is the company that stands behind it and ASUS refuses to honor it's rebate offers.<br/>If the rebate is important to you do not buy the ASUS as they will find some way to deny it.<br/>I do not recommend this product due to the service from ASUS.
I do not know what is happening. I bought my laptop and I installed Windows 10. Since that many times have appeared an error in the screen. I do not know if in the future that is going to cause many troubles.<br/><br/>I would like to know if there is an update of this driver, if not I could return it very soon.
Just received my second Zenbook.  Had to send the other one back because of screen damage.  This one I just received looks like it was sent back, re-wrapped and shipped out again.  I don't see any damage to the laptop, but the inside of the box it came in looked like garbage like someone had shoved it back.  I'm thinking because of the LCD screen bleeding around the edges (which I've heard others discuss and which is also obvious with this laptop).  Anyway, that part doesn't bother me that bad.  I like the look and feel of this product.  However, when running windows 8.1 I notice that I have McAfee running in the taskbar.  It's wanting me to purchase and install the full product.  DAMMIT, it's already installed and running as a service.  I don't want this crap.  I want to uninstall it.  So...let's go to "Programs and Features" and remove this bad boy.  Oh boy!  It's not listed!  How the hell do I uninstall this?  Thanks for being complete s***s, guys!  Now I have to figure out how to forcefully remove this garbage bloatware from my brand new PC.  Very disappointing up until this point.  I thought that I loved ASUS.  I have two monitors that are ASUS.  Both work great!  I have a Google Nexus 7 2013 made by ASUS.  Works great.  Thought this would be a good deal.  I was wrong.  Better off just buying a cheap HP.  Good luck.  Buyer beware.<br/><br/>Also, the resolution is crap.
This is a great laptop for Windows users. I can't complain much about this laptop because of its relatively cheaper price. However I brought this laptop to install Arch linux system and ultimately I choose to install it with Windows to make a dual boot system.<br/>The good things about this laptop is its cheaper price and nice and thin design. Spec is also great when you compare it with other laptops in the market. However as many has already pointed out the biggest issue with this laptop is WIFI connectivity in Linux. I haven't experience any WIFI issues when I m in Windows but in linux always connection drops and I had to use a separate wifi dongle to maintain a stable connection. Also some Fn keys are not properly identified in Linux and advance functionalists of the touch pad like disabling the touch pad while typing is not supported. Hopefully these will be fixed in upcoming kernel releases. Some back-light bleeding is also visible in the laptop I received. Also the average battery hours are much lesser in a linux system. Since this display is FHD in linux you may find all the fonts are very tiny and difficult to read. However there are plenty of workaround for those issues.
My fault for not looking and not the fault of the product, but this model didn't come with a keypad or disc drive.  I returned it and bought a larger version of the ASUS.  I am VERY HAPPY now.
Mouse is very unreliable, jumps unexpectedly. Not a great feel in the hand, could use some rubberized edging. Nice performance.
Received on time. Product satisfactory.
I bought this sight unseen based on the good reviews.  Opened it up today, set it on my lap and was immediately disappointed.  There is a ridge between the screen and keyboard which creases into my skin.  Not comfortable as a laptop if one has on shorts (and I live in Florida.  We ALWAYS have on shorts)  Also don't like the cord being on the right hand side.  Finally, the battery seemed to heat up right away (again, shorts...)  On the plus side, if you live up North, you might like it.  It's ultra-light, the screen is a good size and keyboard is ok...I guess.  Didn't like the loud tapping sound it made when pressing the mouse.  Of course, very easy return on Amazon. Unfortunately, the search for a new laptop continues.
Junk - wireless card did not work upon arrival.
My advice is to avoid any ASUS product with a REBATE.  The process is hugely time-consuming, with unclear directions. Having spent WAY too much time on the application, I was denied because I believe I sent in the "WRONG" UPC sticker from the multiple ones applied to the box.  Of course, ASUS provides a phone number for questions, but there's no way to reach an actual person - you only get a recording. $100 down the drain! Amazon, I'm a loyal customer who appreciates your top-notch customer service. I'm begging you to reject this whole rebate process, and simply provide the best pricing possible. This hassle is not up to your usual high standards!  Thanks for listening. G.
Terrible speakers, 54 updates needed just one week after purchase (which took an hour), Bluetooth won't pick up my devices, the two-finger page-down feature stopped working after updating and did I mention the speakers are no good? I can barely hear YouTube videos on max volume yet these are Bang Olufson?
But ultimately ended up returning it and buying a macbook air.  Very satisfied with the air and would not recommend this ultrabook to anyone, as it gave me so many issues with wifi connectivity and constant windows update errors.  I ended up returning it after 3 weeks of owning it.  I think this product has potential, if it could fix some of it's larger issues.
Exellent.
Was a gift to someone. Great product. Little pricy though
I was searching for a new laptop after my obnoxiously heavy Dell laptop stopped turning on for the second time (after a costly motherboard replacement). After reading favorable reviews for the Zenbook, I took the plunge, excited to make the switch to a much more portable laptop. While the lightweight, streamlined design was initially what attracted me to the Zenbook, I'm starting to think that it's a little TOO lightweight a few weeks into use. The display driver keeps crashing, which triggers my Photoshop to crash. I lost a good amount of work but at least it's teaching me to save obsessively. I also wish there were more ports, or at least it came with more than just a USB-ethernet adapter. A laptop without a CD drive? Seriously? And the ASUS website doesn't carry one either. Sigh. Contemplating returning for a slightly heavier, yet more practical laptop.
It's really bad. The wifi signal is never full, it's very hard to get connected. Even my old phone has a full signal. Sometimes it even cannot search any wifi. And the second day I got it, it already crushed down, I was forced to turn down the power. The trackpad is like a s***, you can't use it to do anything easily. The battery life is not 12 hours, even if I use battery saver and only use it to surf website and do some light work, no video. 8 hours on top, and it concludes 2-3 hours in sleep mode.
Don't do it! I thought I had a decent chance of getting a good product despite the reviews (10% 1-stars, but for very specific problems). Came out of the box, lifted the screen and it feel all the way back. Sleek, beautiful, seemed relatively fast and responsive, but very very cheaply made. Returned immediately - as I understand the customer service can be a nightmare.!
Really wanted to love it. The build is great. The screen is washed out and not pleasant to look at. Battery life was great. Also had intermittent issues with wifi. Speakers were also very quite.<br/><br/>Basically my first gen toshiba chromebook beat it in every way besides build quality.<br/><br/>It went back for a refund.
It's great!
Piece of junk. We bought two of these and both have video issues where the video card constantly crashes and gets BSOD messages. We tried updating the drivers but that didn't solve the issue.
The screen looks very hazy and not as clear as it should be as a 1080p displayer.<br/>And you will get very tired after stare at the screen for a while, very disappoint....
Prior to ordering this machine, I read the descriptions and reviews of the ASUS UX305 laptop on the Amazon website, and the manufacturer's description was as follows: "ASUS ZenBook is lighter, slimmer and faster than other notebooks in its class to give you the unmatched power and all-day portability you need to conquer your day... Featuring the new Intel Core M processor, do more with faster speeds and enhanced efficiency that automatically adjusts performance to what you’re doing. Add to that the incredible responsiveness of the Solid State Drive (SSD), everything from startup to loading demanding programs happens in a flash..."<br/><br/>From this description I expected a high power, efficient machine. What I got what a complete disappointment. I've tried to do some basic excel calculations on this computer during the past few days and these calculations take longer than I've seen on any other machine. It's also slow to load even basic applications such as outlook. The seller and amazon have sorely misadvertised this product.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I did not start using the machine until three months after my purchase date, so I did not realize the gross inaccuracy of the seller's advertising until after their 30 day return policy. Both the seller and Amazon have been completely unhelpful in addressing the issue and helping me get a refund for this horribly inefficient and low power product.
Bought this and returned after a few hours fooling with it. I found the keyboard and trackpad difficult to use. Part of the problem is that the machine is just too light and so shakes slightly on typing if you keep it on your lap, build quality is only B. Screen is good quality but not very bright and I find the wide aspect ratio awkward in a 13". Music was OK through the speakers (Although they're aren't very powerful) but very quiet over good quality headphones. Machine starts up very quickly and runs well. Nice machine for the price but not what I was looking for.
The computer is ok, but the keyboard a bit tinny for the money. The software -- Microsoft Windows 8.1 -- is a disaster. Despite attempts to fix the problem with the help of Asus tech support, it just wouldn't consistently connect to the internet. Talking to Microsoft tech support is a joke. Even though this was a new computer, they wanted additional $$ to diagnose the problem caused by THEIR software. Although the computer itself was ok, dealing with Microsoft made me return the computer.
You ask too much !
Currently out of stock at Microsoft store and didn't see no $100 price reduction from the $699. Did see the 10% off for college student or faculty though.<br/>Using a 3 star as neutral since this is only an update to another reviewers post.
Light, slim, and fast. It's like having a macbook air at half the cost. So why 3 stars? I have another Asus laptop from a year ago that already has major issues. I've had issues with nexus tablets from them as well. They have quality issues so I'm not giving 5 stars until I know for sure.
Don't go anywhere near ASUS products, keyboard is poorly deisgned, trackpad is not good, and mainly - pricey chargers and bad sockets will keep you chasing product support
I'm very sorry that I bought this laptop.  Despite the description of a cool fan-less design, this laptop runs very, very hot.  Too hot to touch. Display is so, so.  Acceptable, but not great.  Speed is okay, but not stellar.  After an hour, the touchpad isn't responding well.  I assume that it's heat related.  I plan to do my best to return it.<br/><br/>Despite registering my product on the Asus site and filling out the tech support form completely, I constantly get "Cannot be empty!".  Ok, what cannot be empty?  Sigh.<br/><br/>15 May 2015 - After some reflection this may have been a little harsh.  Here's some updates:<br/><br/>* Heat Issue - I always turn off the windows updates and then enable a "Check, but let me choose when and where" option because I sometimes surf on a mobile hotspot and don't want Microsoft updating their software on my dime.  Windows still hasn't added reasonable network data usage rules to mitigate this. I suspect this was the cause of the overheating because the Windows default kernel didn't allow for CPU scaling (or similar).  Be sure to do a windows update before you do anything.  If you do gaming or other cpu intensive work, forget about it.<br/><br/>* Price Point - For the price point, it's probably/maybe a reasonable deal for an average user.  I was definitely not happy with the screen quality because I do photography.  For just basic use, it's probably fine.  The SSD was definitely faster (than a HDD), but not blazingly fast.as I was expecting something similar to my HP ultrabook with SSD.<br/><br/>* As I final comment, my experience just seems standard for Windows laptops as the manufacturors have been in race to the bottom to compensate for Windows OS (v. Apple) with a lower price point.  I was planning to dual boot this laptop with linux, but I think I'll just suck it up and move to Apple with their retina displays and better hardware.  (For the record, I'm not a huge fan of Apple, but given rotten support of multiple major players, I no longer see a viable option).
Really horrible experience. Second day of use, computer stops working: no apps can be opened, settings window hangs there and never loads, internet browser doesn't work; only my documents can be accessed. Have to go through a 3 hour cycle of shutting down and rebooting until the computer finally starts properly. Then the computer works fine for some days, then the problem comes again.<br/><br/>Contacted ASUS about it, they told me reset to factory settings. If the computer is new I don't see how that would help<br/><br/>May be I got unlucky, but I wouldn't take a risk with this. Very disappointed with this purchase.
Wifi does not connect and the model number is way off from what is listed on the web site. I am unsure if I even received the correct item.
Turned on one time. Would never turn on again. Beautiful screen, but uncomfortable trackpad.
Specs look good but, in practice, the build quality is so bad that it's fairly unusable. Keyboard is terrible and misses a good 10% of presses, the post-manufacture modifications that asus did to the Intel graphics card makes it crash every 10 minutes or so, if you open the screen fully it lifts the back two rubber "feet" off the surface you're using and so the thing slides around all over the place. Pretty crappy for $799.
If I could get an extra ASUS-original power cord, this would be a great laptop.  Unfortunately, ASUS does not offer this part to their customers.  So far, I have wasted hundreds of dollars on cheap knock-off power cords with various issues.  Some of them are simply way too short (like three feet total).  Others have voltage that are dangerously out of specification (get a volt meter before testing these things on your valuable PC).<br/><br/>It is unfortunate that ASUS does not support their customers more.  Otherwise they'd take over the world with this PC.  A touch screen would be nice at this price level, especially since my cheapo laptop came with one.  I don't use it but my kids do.
EDIT: I decided to give the Zenbook another try, after all it is an incredible bang for the buck, a lot of laptop for the money. I ordered the 512GB storage model, received it, and yeah i can live with the odd color tone actually sort of liking it now. It is kind of a mix of dark plum, dark gray, a hint of brown; not so much on the lid. Dark keyboard keys. I like this laptop. I like how it came with a C: ("OS") and D: ("DATA") partition of the drive, perfect. Recognized the Gigabyte bluetooth mouse that did not work with my Windows 7 laptop I soon will sell.<br/>-------<br/>Just returned this laptop after being so disappointed upon opening the box. The laptop's color as seen in product photos misleading, be WARNED! This is not dark gray as some here have said and as the photos of the product show. It has a very prominent violet/purple hue, something I did not want. You can't see the purple in the product photos but trust me you will be shocked at the violet/purple hue upon seeing this laptop visually in person upon opening the box.
I tried making the text larger and it was not possible. In the default resolution , there was option ro make smaller but not larger- the slider wasalready by default on largest size. . I then changed the screen resolution from the default all the way down to about 1400 by 768. That inceased the size of the icons but not the size of the text! Finally i tried using the magnifier. That made everything jump around and i couldnt find anything. I also tried changing brightness to make it dimmer. The control is minimal only allowing minimal dimming- thats odd since with led backlighting it should be so easy to allow more dimming. (But it was not overly bright , unlike other laptops) Since i cant read the text i cant use the computer. Note It also took forever to set up- never had one that slow before plus the plastic computer really reeks of new plastic - guess that would fade with time. This seems like a computer for kids to me,,
Needed a lightweight laptop for work and school, and something reliable for multiple uses with ability to project multimedia to a second monitor for regular multitasking I rely on to cut my work time down radically (a third to a half). Purchased for speed, multitasking and light weight. Sadly the video experience and second monitor projection have failed. Display has crumpled, driver has stopped periodically and finally the VGA signal to second monitor stopped (I've tried two separate monitors). All this in the first six weeks of ownership. On hold with support right now (five minutes and counting), hoping they will provide an immediate resolution or replace the Zenbook with something better or at least not broken? I doubt this is an issue with my specific laptop, though. Reading through chats, I see many other owners have experienced the same or similar.
Though completely quiet, which is why I bought it for recording, light laptop does not have an Ethernet connection.  Instead they supply a dongle that turns one of the USB ports into an Ethernet port.  This would be OK if they had more USB ports to begin with but there are only three.  Take away one - you now have two.  Choose a program that requires a USB elicense, you now have one.  Connect to an external audio recording device like Antelope Zen Studio and you've just used all your USB ports.  Don't even think about a USB mouse!  The  screen resolution is fine but some programmed controls can end up with their OK box outside the scope of the screen which is inconvenient, at the least.  The 256 GB SSD drive ought to have a 512 GB and 1TB option even though that would increase the price.
Beware of ASUS.  I purchased a different ASUS transformer which first had problems after three months.  The unit was "repaired" and returned.  It then had the same problem several months later.  To make a long story short, the unit was "repaired" four times (and still didn't work properly) before ASUS replaced it with a refurbished unit with less memory.  Because I foolishly believed that the unit had actually been repaired each time, I downloaded the Office software each time I got the unit back.  Now, I've exceeded the allowed number of downloads and will have to purchase Office.  ASUS refused to help with this problem.  If you purchase a new unit, be prepared to end up with a lesser, refurbished one if you have problems and extremely unhelpful customer service.
Terrible!!!<br/>One Cornell University PhD candidate and a PhD physicist at Cornell could not figure out how to find the wi-fi  on the machine. Somehow it could not find available signals and going into various menus did not solve the problem. There is a video describing the exact scenario on youtube. Total waste of time and do not be lured by the low price. At least a thank you to Amazon for no hassle free return. Buy a Dell or a Mac.
Was told I would get an upgrade to windows 10 when I purchased.  Windows 10 is still not availabe for this machine.  Have so far been unsuccessfully when trying to contact customer support through the ASUS website.
Be sure to check out all the issues these laptops have with screen flicker online if you are considering purchasint one.  Just google "asus laptop screen black" or "asus laptop screen flicker" and you will be apalled.  Even despite what is obviously a defect across the board for their products, Asus remains unwilling to remedy the issue and has effectively populated the globe with electronic paperweights. Avoid them if you can...
what is the different between gold and greyish. I see there are two price for two model. Is is because gold has window 10 so it is more expensive?
While performance wise this laptop is everything that it said it was, it is not black in color as it states. It says it is black on the product description on the box it came in, but after receiving two different ones, they are both a grayish, purple, brown color. Aesthetically it just is ugly to me. The picture on the description is black, the laptop pictured on the actual box is clearly black, but the laptop itself is not.
I ordered this product from Amazon.  A $50 rebate was offered by ASUS.  After completing all of the paperwork including cutting up the box for the UPC code, signing a blood oath on their rebate form and submitting the Amazon invoice, ASUS rejected my claim because they stated that Amazon's invoice was invalid.  I told these fools that I submitted the only invoice that Amazon provided to me and they still rejected it.  I wish I had checked the Better Business Bureau in Fremont, CA for their customer complaint record.  It is astounding that they could have so many customer complaints and still remain in business.  Be careful before you order any ASUS product.  I would say stay away and find another manufacturer.  The computer itself is slow and loaded with Microsoft crap that slows the computer down considerably.  I wish I had not purchased this product.
I had an issue with intel HD graphic card
Yes, I like it .But the price is down too fast,I don't accept it, can you explain to me?
I bought it used and the Windows 10 software was defective. The start menu didn't work. I couldn't download anything off the internet. I couldn't access the C drive because of permissions. I returned it after spending hours trying to fix it.
No ethernet port. Product description did not make this clear, nor did the box.
trackpad is a joke
Your basically buying a tablet with s keyboard dummies , buy you a iPad and throw a keyboard on it
a serious disappointment. I researched carefully before buying but returned this computer the day it arrived. Sound from speakers so atrocious, only explanation is that they were damaged. felt heavy and looked cheap. absolutely loaded with pointless and annoying apps that I didn't want. it felt like a cheap computer, but at $700, is vastly overpriced. simply cannot compare to the mac (much as I hate to admit it, since my mac barely lasted two years). asus has some serious work to do if they want to compete with mac in this market.
PRICE  DOWN  35$  WITH SEVERAL DAY  ,  DONT  BUY  NEWER
Should have never bought this product. It does not have a back light keyboard and the OS freezes every so often. The key board is clunky. Its way too expensive for what it offers. I would buy it for $350 and only then give it may be 4 hours.
Great things about this laptop:<br/>It's sleek design, thin, and extremely light weight. The keys light up and it looks very slick at night. Also, it comes with pre installed camera<br/><br/>Horrible things about this laptop:<br/>1 month into using it - issues with keyboard and keys constantly sticking. Google this and you will find tons of people with similar problems.<br/><br/>The touchpad CONSTANTLY does things that I do not want. I have no idea who designed this touchpad, but it is extremely frustrating to use.<br/><br/>Finally, the charging feature of this laptop is via an extremely think stick. It broke literally 13 months after I got the laptop. now I can't charge the damn thing and will need to have it fixed.<br/><br/>I really regret buying this laptop. I bought it for all the reasons listed in the advantages section, but this thing has been more of a headache then actual useful device.
