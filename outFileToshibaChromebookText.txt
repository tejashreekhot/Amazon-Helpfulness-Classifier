The Toshiba Chromebook 2 offers a fantastic experience that really shows what Chromebooks are capable of. The 1080p display is the clear star here, and it's worth every extra penny. Being an IPS display, colors are superb and viewing angles are great. I was particularly surprised how bright it gets. I can comfortably keep the brightness at around 20-25%, which definitely helps with battery life.<br/><br/>As someone who writes a lot, the keyboard is a joy to use. The keys have a nice little spring to them, and it feels natural and comfortable. The touchpad is very accurate, and I don't need or even want to use a separate mouse. As a side note, Google "Chromebook touchpad tips" and click the first result. There's cool gestures you can use which will dramatically improve your experience. In terms of design, this is hands down the best looking Chromebook on the market. The curves and sharp edges really make it stand out, and despite having a plastic body, it's very solid and not flimsy. Doesn't feel cheaply made, and the finish is relatively fingerprint resistant.<br/><br/>The webcam is on par with other Chromebooks, and offers okay quality. However, the dual microphones do give slightly crisper audio. Toshiba teamed up with Skullcandy for some pretty interesting speakers. They're actually hidden inside the keyboard facing up. At first, the sound is a bit tinny like other laptop speakers, but the quality does improve. I can pick up all the little nuances in a wide variety of music, and it gets fairly loud. Sadly, if you're into bass, it's pretty much nonexistent, which is a bit odd considering what Skullcandy is known for.<br/><br/>One early concern of the Toshiba Chromebook 2 was that it has an Intel Bay Trail processor versus Haswell. The Haswell performs better in benchmarks and real world use, there's just no way around it. However, there are a couple pros of going Bay Trail. It uses just 7.5 watts of power under full load, and it's fanless. Even after several hours of use, the Toshiba gets just slightly warm. From watching full 1080p video to browsing webpages, I didn't share the same worries in terms of performance. Even with 10+ tabs open, I could switch back and forth with no lag. If you do a lot of graphic-intensive stuff, you'll probably notice a drop, but for normal everyday use, the Toshiba Chromebook 2 is more than capable.<br/><br/>With the Full HD model, Toshiba claims up to 9 hours of battery life. I've been consistently getting over 8 hours on a full charge with around 15% battery left. Under the right circumstances, I think it's very possible you could squeeze out close to 10 hours.
**Summary: A touch slower than the first gen model, but an acceptable tradeoff for the fantastic high res IPS screen and smaller and lighter build. 2 tips to make it even better: switch to beta channel to fix tiny UI elements e.g. tab fonts, and replace the power cord with a right angle adapter available on Amazon**<br/><br/>I own the original 13" Toshiba Chromebook (which I'll refer to as "first gen") released earlier in 2014 and liked it enough to dump my very nice Asus UX21A Windows ultrabook and use it as my only computer. I tested the more recent 13" Asus CB30 and Samsung Chromebook 2 and found them lacking in comparison.<br/><br/>This updated model...wow, a lot of computer for the price. Toshiba has made several improvements over the 4-star first gen:<br/><br/>1. Screen is fantastic - bright, great viewing angles, and high resolution - and if you switch to the beta channel, you'll get a fix for the tiny UI elements (e.g. tab & app bar text & icons) that plagued the Samsung Chromebook 2 at launch (and this fix will surely filter to stable channel). This is the screen those of us not willing to spring for the Pixel have been wating for!<br/><br/>2. Noticeably smaller, lighter, and fanless body, which retains the first gen's nubby outer / faux-aluminum inner texture. This casing has great grip and resistance to fingerprints & smudging far better than Asus and Samsung (I have not tried the Acer Chromebooks).<br/><br/>3. Springier keyboard similar to Asus CB 30 and Samsung Chromebook 2. In use, I think the shorter travel, "mushier" keyboard of the first gen might actually be faster for touch typists like me. In any event, Toshiba clearly responded to customer feedback here.<br/><br/>4. Speakers under the keyboard instead of the bottom on the first gen. They remain plenty loud, though I have to say I don't find them better sounding (they sound fine, better than most I've heard but like the rest, not much bass. Perfectly acceptable for casual listening.)<br/><br/>5. Smaller power brick (not that the old one was big), thinner cord, and angled pin (the part that plugs into the laptop).<br/><br/>The one drawback, which I find perceptable but acceptable, is that the Intel Bay Trail processor is slightly but noticeably slower than the earlier Intel Haswell. In terms of objective benchmarks, I'm getting Octane benchmark scores of above 7K for the Chromebook 2 on beta channel, down from 10K+ for the first gen model, which I'm running on stable channel. My subjective experience is that gen 2 is slightly slower at loading heavy pages like Google Maps and less capable at intensive multi-tasking e.g. streaming a 1080p YouTube video or music while loading other pages; I do notice temporary (a second or two) but definite stuttering in such cases. I think it's an acceptable tradeoff for the advantages & price. When not multitasking, 1080p videos stream geat.<br/><br/>Just a couple other notes:<br/><br/>1. I can't yet accurately comment on battery life. I was consistently getting 9+ hours on the first gen model. Right now I'm only showing 6+ for this model, but I haven't even made it through a single drain cycle yet, so possibly the battery life prediction is still calibrating. While I'd be disappointed with 6 hours, I'd still view it as acceptable given the improvements. Will update this review when I have more time in use. A commenter and web research suggests that the UI scaling fix provided by the beta channel may be the source of lower battery life.<br/><br/>2. Toshiba still has a two piece power cord, which means you get a long, bulky generic cord from brick to wall plug. But because of the generic design, you can replace it with a shorter cord, or even an adapter that goes straight from plug to adapter brick. I am using the SF Cable 2 Prong Right Angle Plug Adapter, available here on Amazon for under $10 and it works well; there is also a straight version.<br/><br/>Toshiba has done a tremendous job here. I hope they get the many sales they deserve for this model!
I did a lot of research about Chromebooks before I made this purchase.  The general consensus on this particular model was that the screen was out of this world, but you would sacrifice processor speed for battery life and a quiet, fanless laptop.  From my experience, those reviews are spot on.<br/><br/>The good:  There is no way to describe the screen unless you see it.  I don't watch a lot of videos on my laptop, but the screen is much better for everyday browsing.<br/><br/>The bad:  There are a lot of people out there trying to measure performance.  I don't consider myself a power use with this machine, so I wasn't too concerned about performance prior to my purchase.  Turns out I was wrong.  In my research for school, I found a 60 page PDF document.  Nothing too special there and certainly nothing out of the ordinary.  But viewing the document is beyond the power of this machine.  Forget about scrolling with the scroll bar.  The only way to view the document is to hit the down arrow and wait for the screen to catch up after each keystroke.  Note that I closed all of my tabs and only had the PDF running and it still was lagging beyond use.  I also downloaded it to the local drive to take my internet connection out of the equation.<br/>I hit several scenarios like the one above but that is the most concrete example I can give.<br/><br/>I'm very disappointed that the performance is that bad.  I don't know what to do with this machine.  The more I use it, the more frustrating it gets.  It's only been a few days but I am going to return this item.  I understand what a Chromebook is and that it is meant to be a lower cost alternative, but this is a high end Chromebook.  It is too bad that even a high end Chromebook isn't able to perform a simple task.  I really, really want to like this machine.  But if I keep it I think the new laptop appeal will wear off and I'll get more frustrated as this machine can't keep up with my relatively simple demands.<br/><br/>UPDATE:  To verify that it was this computer and not something specific to the PDF or the Chromebook built in PDF reader, I looked up the exact same PDF file at Best Buy on the old Acer C720.  That Chromebook is older but it is known for having a better processor.  The Acer performed great when looking at the same document.  I feel even more confident saying that the processor was holding back the Toshiba.<br/><br/>SECOND UPDATE:  I returned this Chromebook and instead purchased the Acer C720 with the Core i3 processor.  I didn't notice until I started using the Acer how slow the Toshiba was.  Things I attributed to ChromeOS really were due to the hardware of the machine.  For instance, the first thing I Googled when I had my Toshiba was something like "Chromebook lags while typing".  I spent a fair amount of time trying to find out why my Chromebook couldn't keep up with my keystrokes.  I attributed this to a background update or something native to ChromeOS.  Wrong!  I have never had that problem with the i3 processor.  The processor makes all the difference.
Like many other reviewers here I, too, had display issues with my new computer - with vertical lines appearing on the screen while the computer was still early in its warranty period. (See attached photo - personal info redacted).<br/><br/>And like the others, Toshiba refused to honor the warranty, claiming physical damage. It suffered no more abuse than any other laptop I've ever owned. I think it's a quality issue.<br/><br/>Given the number of similar claims, it seems obvious to me this is a product defect that either Toshiba is not acknowledging - or may not be aware of. I tried to uplevel the issue within Customer Service at Toshiba, maybe even speak to a product manager or someone who works in Quality Control, but the manager I spoke to said I couldn't move the issue beyond him. All right then, so I'm taking the whistleblower route instead. Beware of the Toshiba Chromebook 2 - it very likely has a product defect.
I was looking for a computer for school and didn't have a lot of money to spend. I looked at Acer's top of the line, aluminum finished computers running i7's and retailing for $1,500 as well as looked into MacBook's which could be had with a school discount for $800. Then something hit me, all of this was overkill. I reevaluated my needs as a student and really looked at what my school needed me to do. This review will be a brief overview of Chrome OS and how to get over some of the main hurdles that you'll face if you're thinking about buying this for school or business.<br/><br/>Before I get into the technical stuff and my overall review of the product, I asked myself the following questions?<br/><br/>1) What major am I in? What software/hardware requirements would I need? Why are these requirements suggested? Do I plan on taking any online courses in the near future?<br/>2) How important is battery life to me?<br/>3) How important is portability and screen size to me? Bigger screens usually means a bulkier laptop.<br/>4) How important is the keyboard? How much typing will I need to be doing? (e.g. English major over the occasional paper)<br/>5) Extra features not necessary but would like to have<br/>6) Your budget<br/><br/>After going through the above checklist I was able to make an informed decision about what I wanted from a laptop. I came up with the following requirements:<br/>I was a business major who had to write the occasional paper, I wanted a nice 13" screen, portability and battery life were very important to me, and it had to be fast (SSD was a must), extra features like backlit keys or Bluetooth were of no concern to me. The biggest hurdle I ran into was finding a computer that could fit my budget of $400-$500. There were a few contenders such as the Dell Inspiron 7000 (i5 series). That computer was remarkable in that you could upgrade the HDD to a SSD and swap out the RAM. That nearly sold me until I ran into this puppy...<br/><br/>Chrome OS and why I went with this computer:<br/>I was going to pull the trigger on the Dell but I realized I would have to spend an additional $100 to upgrade the HDD to a SSD when Chromebooks already come with a built in 16GB SSD. That saved me some money in the long run and this computer ended up pricing out the Dell for the features I wanted by about $100. I was sold.<br/><br/>That being said, I was really happy I got this computer. The finish on it is a nice matte silver. It has a nice smooth finish and a ridged texture on top of it. When you open it up, you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference between this and a MacBook Air. Toshiba has always been a reliable brand for me (I've owned 3 of their laptops, all dying from user error or being sold off before their time was up) so I expected this to be the same and after owning this computer for two months I'm glad to say I'm not disappointed. It feels premium and not plasticky at all.<br/><br/>Keyboard is pretty solid with great travel, speakers are very loud considering their laptop speakers, and the IPS display is gorgeous. The IPS screen on this computer is the main selling point for this computer, it really makes the colors pop. 1080P does make everthing seem smaller as other reviewers have said but you just have to scale everything to about 125% and you'll be fine. This is not so much a Chrome OS thing as it is a Toshiba thing as they packed so many pixels into such a small display (you'll be hard pressed to find many 1080P 13" displays around). I don't use the trackpad so I can't speak to that but it seems fine.<br/><br/>Battery life is pretty excellent: I get anywhere between 6-7 hours which is all I really need. This is actually kind of low for a Chromebook as they require very minimal resources but it's because this thing is running a very bright and pixel density display (almost 400 nits and 1080!). In my opinion, you'll rarely need to bring your cord.<br/><br/>Storage: Storage is lacking but if you take advantage of the introductory offer you get 100GB of Google Drive included with this machine. You can also buy a MicroSD card or a USB flash drive and expand storage. Many people don't know this but you can actually buy a external hard drive and the system will recognize it. If you're willing to carry around a portable drive you can actually store as much as you could on a regular 500GB HDD based Windows Machine.<br/><br/>Software: So, what is Chrome OS anyway? It's basically a OS based around the Chrome browser. All of your work is done in the browser. Chrome has apps and extensions which can be "pinned" to your taskbar or "shelf" as they call it just like you would in Windows. Except, instead of launching a program on your local desktop, think of it more like a bookmark to a website where it launches either an extension, app or website of your choosing.<br/><br/>Chrome OS definitely takes some getting use to but once you learn to work around it's limitations you can make this a very viable machine. I would suggest you do the following to make the most of it:<br/><br/>-What programs are must have from another OS (Mac, Windows, etc.)?<br/>-What programs can you find online alternatives for (e.g. replacing Word with Google Docs, e.g. replacing Photoshop with an online photo editor)<br/>-Use WiFi/Bluetooth transferring between your devices such as your phone. This limits the headaches associated with drivers or the system picking up your files properly. I use WiFi droid (free app for Android) to accomplish this.<br/>-Think online: A lot of the caveats of this system are that it's limited to a browser. Have this already in mind. For example, I totally forgot that ZIP and RAR files are not recognized by the OS nor is there any real native program that can handle this. A quick Google search for "online zip extractor" found me a great little online tool that did the work for me. I did this a lot when I was first setting up my Nvidia Shield and transferring over games.<br/>-Install Chrome Remote Desktop: This is one of the best extensions that the Chrome Store has to offer. It's a remote desktop programs that works right inside the Chrome browser which already makes it more capable then it's counterparts (TeamViewer, LogmeIn). Since Chrome is basically found on every device now it means you have a lot of flexibility when it comes to getting a program you need that is only found on the native OS (e.g. Graphic designer requires Photoshop for his job, engineer requires AutoCAD, etc. which is only found on Windows and Mac). This overcomes the main complaint that people have that say this computer can't run any programs. It can to some degree if you already have another computer located somewhere in your house that you dedicate to certain things (such as a dedicated file server that you could install your most necessary programs on).<br/><br/>Performance:<br/>I didn't expect much out of a Celeron processor but coupled with 4GB's of RAM and a internal 16GB SSD it's actually pretty fast. Because this is such a low power system it also means it doesn't have a fan which makes this truly silent. I wouldn't recommend the 2GB variant of this product unless you really didn't require that many tabs as Chrome is a resource hog (maybe less so on Chrome OS because it's optimized for the system, not sure). 4GB allows you to get away with more. I usually have 10 tabs open at a time and this meets my needs. The WiFi is pretty quick. This computer has a wireless AC built in card (hard to find feature for this price point).  I have a Wireless AC Asus Router and a 50Mb/s connection so everything seems to load pretty quick for me. Your mileage may vary depending on your router, your distance away, etc. as is typically expected with all wireless connections.<br/><br/>*Hidden Features, oo**<br/><br/>Chrome OS can recognize external hard drives, SD cards, flash drives, wireless mice, and webcams. All of this can be added to expand and overcome the limitations of Chrome OS.<br/><br/>Overall:<br/>This is a pretty capable machine. Most students in college overestimate how much power they need from a system unless they're in a very demanding field like Graphic Design, Software Engineering or Electrical/Mechnical Engineering. I wouldn't recommend this as the sole laptop for those users as Windows dominates in those fields. There are no real viable online alternatives to AutoCAD and most graphics majors don't have a choice as to what computers they need. As for me, a business major who has to write case studies and a couple papers and do some online questions from StatsLab this computer works great for that.  In conjunction with a good Windows computer (e.g. I have a Windows server that I built for $400) this is a very capable machine.<br/><br/>I recommend this computer to anyone who is realistic with their expectations, understands the limitations of Chrome OS and has a second computer in the house that is Windows or Mac (dependant on what you need) if you have a major that requires you to have specific programs as you can remote into those computers when need be. This is not the be all, end all computer but it's a great complimentary computer to a main machine. Highly recommended, even over the HP Stream (Windows just doesn't run well under those low spec environments, hardware manufacturers constantly ignore the minimum spec requirements put out by Microsoft to the detriment of their customers who experience slowdowns after just months of use from their machines.)<br/><br/>Let me know if you have any questions in the comments. I'd be happy to help! I will update this in a few months if I experience any WiFi issues or anything else like people have stated.
I've had the same problem as everyone else here has had with the screen breaking down after less than 3 months of use!  Uggh I wish I would have noticed these reviews before I bought it!  After taking pictured of the screen as instructed no one ver got back to me, so I called and called and waited on hold endlessly over and over only to finally be told that the damage (as diagnosed by looking at pictures???) was not covered.  Theminimum cost for repair according to their websit is $225- almost the price of a brand new one.  I am so beyond frustrated!!  I bought the hard shell case- never travelled with it, just had it sitting on my desk and I somehow broke it?  I bought the square trade warranty but that won't go into effect until the manufacturer warranty has expired.  I will never ever purchase another Toshiba product again!!!!!!!!!!
I was quite pleased with this Chromebook, but after six months I opened the display to find a large black rectangle in the upper left hand corner of the screen.  I sent pictures of this to Toshiba tech support, and they told me that this issue isn't covered under warranty because it is "physical damage".  I treated the Chromebook like a normal laptop and this isn't the result of an accident or abuse.  If you read other one star reviews here you will find I am not alone.<br/><br/>When the Chromebook was fully functional, it was a great machine and the display was a high point.  Performance was reasonable for my needs.  I couldn't use it for Google Hangouts because the microphone did not pick up my side of the conversation.  That's another issue that others have noted.<br/><br/>I hope Chromebooks continue to feature high resolution displays, it's great for getting a lot of information on the screen at once.
Same problem reported by others. Screen started displaying horizontal and vertical lines. Unfortunately discovered two days after it could be returned for a refund. Very disappointed as it will take hours to coordinate repair and diagnosis.<br/><br/>Update on 04 March:  Toshiba said would not fix it because it was user causes damage which was not true. First time really disappointed with Amazin purchase.  Although the blame is squarely on Toshiba.
I've owned this chromebook for a couple months now, and I have to say, it's excelled at pretty much everything I could want it to do.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>-Lightweight and portable<br/>-Bonkers price value<br/>-ChromeOS is so smooooooooth<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>-ChromeOS also very limited<br/>-Battery life could be better<br/>-Microphone kind of blows<br/><br/>In terms of physical specifications, it is middle ground. It's pretty light and thin, the overall look of it is nice, texture feels kind of cheesy, but it was only three hundy's so I don't see why that would really matter. The keyboard is just good enough, keys travel nice and it's spaced well. Screen size is exactly what is perfect for a easy to move around laptop, any more and you're pushing the boundaries. The screen quality? Absolutely fantastic, and I'm sure you've read that in pretty much every other review on here. But, it really is a pretty screen for the size and price.<br/><br/>It has all the ports I need and then some, I've actually even thrown in an SD card for a bit of extra storage, but it's not like you're gonna be storing much on here anyway, that's not what it's meant for. The trackpad is solid and I have yet to run into a problem with it, always registers my swipes and taps. The battery size is extremely middle ground, nine hours is PUSHING it, realistically you'll get 6 or 7, but it really isn't an issue for me since I rarely take it far from the charger. As for complaints, the only two things that kind of blow are the microphone and headphone jack. Maybe it's just my personal model but the microphone is terrible, picks up every noise involved with touching and moving the laptop, so video chatting can get a bit bad for the other person if you aren't still. The headphone jack is very sensitive in the fact that my headphones can pop out VERY easily if they get tugged with even the smallest force. Again, this might be only me, but these are fairly small problems that are easy to overcome.<br/><br/>Now, the software; I really love chromeOS, it runs like an absolute dream. The boot times are mind bogglingly fast, I've got everything I want open in twenty seconds, it's amazing. The obvious limitation is the app selection kind of blows, but everyone should know that going in to buying a chromebook. The hardware is able to run through pretty much anything you can throw at it though, obviously within reason. I can have 30 tabs open in chrome at a time and there's not too much of a noticeable difference if there were none. If you really want to, you can throw linux onto your chromebook and open the functionality up a bit, it works pretty well(tried it myself!). The only real let down is the lack of skype on chromeOS, but if you're okay with google hangouts, which is a really solid alternative, it isn't too debilitating.<br/><br/>All in all, this is probably the best price to performance chromebook you can get, at least so far. The specs aren't outstanding by any means but it will get the job done if you're looking for a second computer to lounge with in bed.
The only reason this is not a verified purchase review is because at the time of purchase, Amazon was out of stock. That sort of helped, because I also saved on the tax which amounted to roughly $30 saved. Now it looks like they further hiked their price from the $329 MSRP to $389 since yesterday these laptops were going for $329/Prime. Not sure why they're playing these kind of pricing games when ABT, BestBuy, etc.. still have them for $329. Anyway, on to the review...<br/><br/>Unless you have $1250-1500 to dish out on a Google Chromebook Pixel, I highly doubt you can find a better Chromebook than this one. I've been using the 2012 Samsung Chromebook (ARM processor), and have bought several Samsung products over the years. This is my first ever Toshiba product.  The differences between my 2012 Samsung and this Toshiba laptop are simply amazing, literally night and day. The most glaringly obvious difference is the screen, which really must be seen to be truly appreciated. It rivals that of a MacBook Retina display. There are only a handful of Chromebooks on the market that are full 1080p HD, this is one of them.<br/><br/>It's been widely discussed how Samsung dropped the ball on their flagship Chromebook 2 by failing to upgrade the inferior TN panel to an IPS screen. Everything you've read about this fact is true. I've seen the new Samsung Chromebook 2 live, and almost bought it when it came out. I'm so glad I did my research and waited. I cannot emphasize what a difference the IPS panel makes, that was the key selling point for me. The resolution on this laptop is incredible, I almost can't believe they're giving these laptops away with such a gorgeous screen for $329. There is actually a 2400x1350 resolution setting but the text and icons are nearly impossible to view. Even with the 1920x1080 they're very small, so I opted to keep mine on 1536x864 and upscale the zoom on web pages to 110% (using ctrl+). For my needs, this resolution is perfect. This screen has a razor sharp, clean, vibrant picture without washed out colors dull like on my Samsung 2012 model (which uses a 720p TN screen). The viewing angle is also much wider than my Samsung.<br/><br/>It's maxed out with 4GB of RAM (I've yet to see a Chromebook with > 4GB RAM?), unlike my Samsung which only has 2GB. And although many say the Celeron CPU could be better, it's a big upgrade from the Samsung ARM processor which can barely handle 8-10 tabs before bogging down. I've run the Toshiba with over a dozen open tabs including Youtube and Netflix, and there's no lag, skipping, or playback issues. I plan to install Ubuntu on my Chromebook. From what I was reading, Chromebooks with Intel processors are more Liunx friendly. There aren't any cooling fans, so it's super quiet. It does get slightly warmer than my Samsung but the heat is barely even noticeable. The Skullcandy speakers are extremely impressive, they have some amazing output and base to them. I had them cranked only at 15% and it was pretty loud.<br/><br/>The keyboard has your standard chiclet keys, which are nicely spaced out. The black keys against the metallic silver background give it that MacBook Air look. The keys have a nice feel to them and are really responsive. One of the perks of having a 13.3" screen is the extra real estate you also get to work with on the keyboard side. I wear M-L size gloves, typing at my normal 65-70 wpm is no problem. The trackpad is super responsive as well and has various adjustment settings you can play around with under the Chrome settings tab.<br/><br/>Yes, the case is made of plastic, but at $330 you get a lot of bang for your buck. I'd rather get a laptop with a cheap case that has a brilliant screen, than a nice case with a crappy screen... trust me this ain't no pig with lipstick on it! That distinction goes to the Samsung Chromebook 2 for using the lowly TN panel on a 1080p laptop. Toshiba did a great job of using plastic, yet giving it a silver metallic aluminum appearance. It looks a lot more elegant when you see it in person...in my opinion more elegant than the cheesy faux leather case that Samsung is touting on their new Chromebook 2.<br/><br/>I used a lot of Samsung Chromebook comparisons in this review for two reasons. I own a Samsung 2012 Chromebook and my next upgrade was going to be the Samsung 2 1080p model. I'm not a Samsung hater by any means, I just think they made a colossal blunder by being cheap with their TN screen when they could have spent a little more on a far superior IPS screen. If their main selling point was 1080p resolution, they should have built it with the proper screen that 1080p could be appreciated on, namely an IPS panel. This is where Toshiba stepped up to the plate, got it right and delivered big time. Hats off to them for foreseeing what consumers really wanted in a Chromebook at a very, very reasonable price.<br/><br/>Bottom line is this. If you're shopping around for a cheap new laptop with stylish high-end looks, excellent performance, and an amazing high res display that you can use for browsing, email, videos, movies, music, etc.. you need not look any further. THIS IS THE ONE.<br/><br/>Update 4/1/15 : Photos of Samsung 2012 720p model next to the Toshiba 1080p added.
Toshiba CB35-B3340 13.3 Inch Chromebook...<br/>Where to start? First, I’ve never written a review but, I do write to my Blog, ByDuncan.com. Amazon sent me an e-mail and asked me to write a review of my purchase of the Toshiba CB35-B3340 13.3 Inch Chromebook. Like you I read reviews when I’m buying something so, I thought, what the hell, let’s give this review thing a try.<br/>I’m a 72 year old retired mortgage banker living in Southwest Florida. My computer skills are about a 5 on a scale of 1-10.  So, if you know all the basic stuff about Chromebook this will not be the review for you. I will be speaking from my level of expertise.<br/>How many choices do we have? Good night, count them. As you look around the internet like I did there are manufactures like HP, Aces, Asus, Samsung, Dell, Lenovo, Hisense, Haier and Toshiba. I even think Google has a Chromebook offering, too.<br/>You get to pick the color of your Chromebook. Some make the Chromebook in basic black, white or the shiny gray look.  Screen size is your next choice. I think there are 3 choices, 11-13-15 inch.<br/>A Chromebook is not a laptop computer. There is no hard drive spinning around inside like a record on a record player. It has a memory stick type of memory. There are no moving parts to the hard drive. The memory is like a USB memory stick you stick in the side of your desktop or laptop and save something to give data, pictures or music to someone else. Or, it might look like a memory card similar to the one in your digital camera inside the Chromebook. There IS NOT a lot of memory available inside the Chromebook like a laptop or desktop. You are not going to save your 300,000 prize photographs on your Chromebook. (By the way, I use a Western 120 gig portable hard drive I stick in the USB when I need my 300,000 prize winning photographs)<br/>If you use Google e-mail, Calendar or Contacts you are way ahead of the Chromebook game. All that personal data you create is stored “In The Cloud.” Let’s talk about the “Cloud.” Your e-mail, Calendar, and Contacts are stored, not in your computer, but in a huge computer more than likely in a mountain somewhere in Utah. It’s not in the sky… So, the Chromebook is going to work just like your Android cell phone Google users. The same data (e-mail, Calendar, Contacts) you get on your phone you can also get on your laptop or your desktop and now you can pull in down to your Chromebook, as long as you have an internet connection.<br/>Okay, I bought the Toshiba 13 inch Chromebook because I will be using the machine/Chromebook to surf the web, check my email, adjust and look at my calendar, watch video and write my stories for my Blog, ByDuncan.com.<br/>I guess I chose the Toshiba because of the screen quality. I wanted the crystal clear screen for watching video. Let me tell you how I use my Chromebook. I have a Lanai in the rear of my home in Southwest Florida.  The weather here is fantastic most of the time, (except when it’s really hot) even when it rains. I like to sit on the Lanai (back in Indiana we called it a screened in porch) and watch Ted Talks, PBS Nightly Business Report and other news and entertainment programs. My wife likes to watch the ID channel. I hate those crime shows. I think she is trying to see the best way to bump me off.  So, if I sit next to her in the house, which a husband has got to do once in a while, I put my Chromebook in my lap and go on-line. (I have a wireless internet system in the house called – WIFI – Comcast put it in.) I put my ear buds in and watch what interests me and she watches what she likes. I wanted a really clear, crisp, screen for video. The other Chromebooks are fine for doing that too, but the Toshiba screen is really way ahead of the other Chromebooks as far as having a really sharp and clean looking presentation. I will compare the Toshiba screen to the debate over analog TV vs (HD) High Definition TV shows. That maybe a little over the top, but if you go out and look at the different Chromebooks like I did I think you will discover there is a marked difference. I went to Best Buy and looked at all the Chromebook screens on the floor. I decided I was going to watch a lot of video on my Chromebook, so the sharp and clean looking screen for me was best.<br/>With this magnificent screen comes a little problem, however I found out how to fix the problem. Because the screen has real tiny dots to make the video look so good, your e-mail will look real small on the screen. It’s hard to see and read. At first I thought I made a big mistake buying the Toshiba. But in the upper right hand corner on the screen are three small horizontal bars. I hit that and a menu pops down and I can increase the size of the written word or text to a size I can read. It’s an extra step in reading documents or text, but I have gotten used to it now that I know how to get my e-mail the size I need on the screen so I read it. (Remember, I’m 72?)<br/>Yes, Toshiba is more expensive to buy. But, so is the “good” Scotch I drink. Look, it all depends on how you are planning on using your Chromebook. If I had a kid about 8-10 years old I would buy them the cheapest Chromebook I could find but in my case I wanted what I wanted. You buy what you need and want. Good luck with your purchase; I like mine a lot. Salute!
BTW, if this thing is still on pre-order at Amazon when you read this, consider doing like I did and picking one up at Best Buy.  Much better option than waiting or paying the price premium to buy from their third-party partners.  I posted a full review over on BB, feel free to go there and check that out.<br/><br/>If you're reading this, you know this is a great machine on paper, but you have your doubts.  So did I, but no more - they have been erased by my experience.<br/><br/>The concerns I had going in to the purchase were about the performance ("not as good as Haswell-based machines" sounds scary but really means nothing to me) and about the readability of text due to the high resolution display.<br/><br/>If you're running Chrome OS as most of you will be, your options on resolution are limited but worth pursuing.  Apparently you can switch to an experimental channel for Chrome OS itself, or you can change the zoom for Chrome itself (which fixes most text but still leaves controls small), but for me, simply downgrading the resolution one notch is actually my favorite option.  Ctrl+Shift+"+" kicks it down to 1536x864, which is still better than most other Chromebooks or low end laptops but much more readable on a 13" display than 1920x1080.<br/><br/>I, however, bought this to run Linux, which provides enough control (although still not as complete as I'd like) over how things are scaled.  I found with a few tweaks I can keep the display at full resolution but still still have "most" text and controls readable.  Or, if I get tired to the few controls that still won't scale, I could use the same solution of reducing resolution one notch.<br/><br/>So no matter whether using Chrome OS or Linux, the resolution issue is one you can deal with.  So for me the remaining concern was performance.<br/><br/>If you're using Chrome OS for the sorts of things it was designed for - web browsing including Google Docs - it's really hard to see how anyone could complain.  Things work just fine.  If you are trying to play graphics-intensive games, that could be another matter, but I think for most people, it's just a non-issue, period.<br/><br/>Linux allows you to do more than Chrome OS, so there is more cause to care about performance.  But after a week of use, I'm happy to say it is exceeding my expectations by a considerable margin.  I have Linux (Ubuntu) on a fairly high end (and huge/heavy) "gaming" laptop and of course the Chromebook 2 (also running Ubuntu) is not as fast as that, but in every possible way it comes off as noticeably faster than my somewhat older quad core Windows laptop.  Some of that difference is Linux versus Windows, some of it is SSD versus HDD, some might have to do with other hardware, but I guess the point is, raw CPU performance is probably overrated for most purposes.  I am doing software development, and on the Chromebook 2 my compiles run faster, the software I am working on (MuseScore, for those curious) *runs* faster (even though I might have thought it was largely CPU-bound), and virtually everything else about this machine just feels faster and quite literally "lighter weight" than my Windows laptop.<br/><br/>If there is one very slight complaint I have with the Chromebook 2, it's that the power cord is not the tightest-fitting I've ever seen (nor is it the loosest!).  Do be sure to plug it all the way in - it kind of feels like it is plugged in before it totally is - but even fully plugged in, there is a bit of play.  Oh well.  Beyond that, build quality is really quite good especially considering the price.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Toshiba nailed it with this Chromebook 2.  Going with the Bay Trail processor allowed for the smaller/lighter/fanless form factor which I think is going to matter more to most people than whatever slight performance drop there might be compared to some other machine.  It's still going to be more than fast enough, and indeed faster than a lot of other not-so-old machines.  Whatever complaints anyone might have about font scaling due to the high resolution are not the fault of the machine - it's a software issue, and you can work around it through the software as well.<br/><br/>EDIT: I see some other people are complaining about performance, saying that there is a several second delay typing if you have more than two tabs open.  I have no idea what these people are talking about, and wonder if perhaps they have a defective unit or something else running in the background that they have forgotten.  As I mentioned, I am running Ubuntu under crouton, which means it is running *in addition* to Chrome OS.  As I type this, I have 7 browser tabs open in Ubuntu (plus three or four I have open on the Chrome OS side), also eight *other* applications running - an IRC chat app, QtCreator (a software development environment), MuseScore, and a 300+ page document loaded into Google Docs - a variety of things both big and small, and they are all running just fine.  At no time while I am typing this is there even the *slightest* lag in my typing. I just loaded a 100+ page PDF, and it scrolls just fine too.  Takes maybe half a second for the screen to redraw if I drag the scrollbars a long way extremely fast; using the keyboard or touchpad gestures it's virtually instant.  I'm pushing this machine *hard* and it's standing up just fine performance-wise.<br/><br/>There's just no way the Bay Trail CPU lags noticably just typing with a couple of chrome tabs open.  That's almost laughable considering how much I am doing on this machine with no problems whatsoever.
We had this notebook for a MONTH and the screen failed us.  First it was 1 black line in the middle of the screen-then the next day it became most of the screen of colored lines and it gave us about a half an inch to work with.  Tried to call Toshiba for any resolution to get it repaired or replaced, and got absolutely nowhere.  The snarky lady (after being transferred and put on hold many times) just kept apologizing for my "inconvenience" but could not help me since the screen is not under their "limited warranty."  I would not buy this product again. Oh, and if you are outside the first 25 days of buying it, you must pay to talk to a tech. person.  Very poor customer service. Otherwise it is fast if you can get the screen to work.
So I got the Toshiba 13.3" Chromebook 2 in today.<br/><br/>First a little history about me, I was a Pixel owner who gave it up because of the horrible battery life (literally 2-3 hours). I purchased a 13" Macbook Pro Retina last November and have been running ever since. I prefer ChromeOS to OSX, so I have been waiting for a revamped Pixel to launch to switch back over. In the meantime this Toshiba gets announced and I thought I would give it a try.<br/><br/>The new Toshiba is impressive in so many ways. Someone mentioned in another review, that the screen is not as good as the Macbook Air and they are wrong (tried that first, before going to Pro Retina). IPS is a whole other level that a TN panel cannot match. HP got it right with the Chromebook 11 (first version), they just put a awful processor in it. Toshiba has been one of the few (if not the only), to finally answer our complaints and stick a beautiful higher resolution screen with a semi-beautiful design. Initially, I did find the text small for my liking (at 1080p). Thanks to another community user, I immediately switched to Beta Channel and did the Force DPI flag (chrome://flags/#force-device-scale-factor). THIS WAS THE ANSWER! Text was clear and deep, just as I am used to with the Macbook and Pixel. Look at the attached pic of the comparison screen of my $1400 Macbook Pro Retina (one of the highest end screens available on the market), and the $329 new Toshiba. While I felt the colors were a tad nicer on the Macbook, the difference is very little. That screen comparison below is forcing the Chromebook to 1.4, while still keeping the zoom at 100%.<br/><br/>Everyone else can look at pictures to get their thoughts on design. I think it is nice and would have no issue dragging this into a customer meeting. This has very little flex in the body when compared to cheaper Samsungs. My Macbook is aluminum that I am scared of scratching and denting (I previously dented my Pixel). So to be safe, I ended up covering the aluminum with a plastic shell. The Toshiba is not at the high price point to worry about it and I am sure the plastic diamond coating will hold up much better then aluminum anyway (for scratches and dents). So is the Macbook a little better design (sure, a little when no protection is used). But when I don't have to put a shell around this, this is the ultimate winner.<br/><br/>So what is it missing? A backlit keyboard would have been nice. Speed seems OK, and I am sure it will get better as they optimize some things for the Bay Trail chipset. Touchpad seems a little slow for my perfect liking, but I am used to etched glass at a much higher price. Sound is nice, not as full or loud as Macbook but much better then other computers in this price range (I would say 85-90% of Macbook volume and fullness). The force device scale factor will make it a better device for 80% of people (everyone should try it).<br/><br/>Overall, a great device. Battery seems like a solid 6 hours. I might actually sell my Macbook Pro Retina for the price difference.
Good for college students!<br/><br/>Those who complain about these devices really don't do their research beforehand.<br/><br/>Youtube lags? Disable html5 player.<br/>Cannot play local video files? Get the format right, or install VLC in crouton<br/>everything too small for your old eyes? Change the d*** DPI, or get the one with crappier 1366x768 screen.<br/><br/>This chromebook really looks like a Mac (UNIX), and if you install ubuntu (UNIX-like) and macbuntu themes, you can fool some friends.<br/>Since I'm gonna use this for note taking, I installed Office 2010, Adobe Acrobat Pro, Evernote. VLC plays 1080p bluray just fine, and it looks stunning on this screen.<br/><br/>Battery life is around 9 hours if i dont do anything heavy, browse some web.<br/><br/>If you plan to install linux, i suggest getting a mini usb3.0 thumbdrive instead of using SD card. Bay Trail device like this will unmount SD card when ChromeOS goes to sleep. When you wake up, ChromeOS incorrectly remounts it as read-only, so your crouton will crash. usb drive dont get unmounted, so it won't have this problem
After having used the Toshiba Chromebook 2 for 3 days, here are my impressions:<br/><br/>This Chromebook is surprisingly light for a 13.3 inch screen. It's also thin and, to my eye, looks  quite stylish and sleek. The silver plastic chassis  has a dimpled texture that helps with the grip and looks pretty nice, in my opinion. Build quality seems solid although it might be too soon to evaluate as far as durability goes.<br/><br/>The touchpad is large and smooth and it works fine for my taste. The keyboard is good too with good travel and not too much mushiness. I've used better ones but it's quite serviceable.<br/><br/>Battery life depends greatly on personal usage but in my experience 7 to 8 hours is realistic with this machine.<br/><br/>Performance is pretty good also. Pages open quickly and you can open multiples tabs at once. There are faster Chromebooks in the market but for most people performance should be more than sufficient. ChromeOS is known for offering good performance on affordable hardware and this one foots the bill.<br/><br/>The speakers on this machine fire from underneath the keyboard and I must say that I'm quite impressed with the sound they produce. They get pretty loud and sound quality is decent enough. For a $330 dollar machine I think they exceed expectations.<br/><br/>This all leads to the main event on this Chromebook and that is the screen. In one word, this screen is fantastic. It's very bright with great contrast and saturation. Viewing angles are very good too and it doesn't reflect as much as other IPS panels I've seen. The full HD resolution makes everything sharp and reading text on this machine is a nice experience. The 13.3 inch size is a good compromise between size and portability and it works very well with this great screen.<br/><br/>One note about the 1920 x 1080 resolution:<br/>At it's default setting the icons and UI elements appear small on the screen. This can be remedied by switching to the beta channel and adjusting the scaling via a Chrome flag. If you don't want to do this you can zoom the display or you can wait till this feature comes to the stable channel which should be soon.<br/><br/>I've owned many Chromebooks in the last two years. The reason for this is that it has been very difficult to find a Chromebook that offers good performance, decent build quality and a nice screen at a reasonable price. There have been Chromebooks with nice screens but poor performance (HP 11) or nice screen with high price (Pixel). There have been other Chromebooks with great performance (Acer C720 and other Haswell based Chromebooks) but sub par screens or build quality. This Toshiba while far from perfect offers good build quality and ergonomics coupled with good performance and a great screen all for a very reasonable $330.<br/>It's great value in my opinion.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>Great screen<br/>Loud speakers<br/>Thin and light<br/>Stylish design<br/>Good battery life<br/>Fanless<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>Not the fastest performer<br/>Edges are a bit sharp and can dig into your palms when holding it<br/>Bottom can get warm<br/>There might be questions about durability<br/>It doesn't have a touchscreen<br/>ChromeOS scaling is not available in default settings
If you are on the fence about buying a Chromebook over a Windows or Mac PC, this unit should be your comparison benchmark. I can't tell you infallibly that Chrome OS is right for everyone, but after making the switch from a tablet, I can assure you that for 90+% of people, it is. If you have a desktop computer for the occasional specific program need, storage space etc. and this would be your regular use machine, you will be fine. But hey, you can do the research on Chrome OS and if it is a good fit or not, because it essentially works the same on any Chromebook.<br/><br/>If you are already set on getting a Chromebook and aren't sure about models, stop looking and buy this one now. For the price, it is an absolutely amazing little unit. I've had mine just under a week and have put in hours a day just for the sake of using it - the screen itself blows most laptops out of the water, including new Macbook Airs and my older 13.3" Macbook I had in college. The build quality is more than adequate for the cost, and the battery life still has me scratching my head as to how it can keep going for so long. It does NOT get hot, and has no fans, so it is as silent as an iPad. And SO light.<br/><br/>My only concern when I was reading through these reviews in your shoes was that the processing power would be underwhelming. I have yet to encounter a legitimate issue. I am sure that if you had 15 tabs open that were all playing video and audio content simultaneously, you would see some stutter. But who legitimately switches between 10 or more open tabs productively? Either stop the pages or close the tabs! I can easily run 1080p60 YouTube vids, while editing an MS Word Online doc and Spotify playing for good measure, with no noticeable decrease in performance - if you need to do much more multitasking than that, then your problem isn't the Chromebook, its Chrome OS as a whole.<br/><br/>Note: As other reviewers and posters suggested, I immediately switched to the Beta Channel and turned off a few surprisingly CPU-heavy extensions that are better purposed for Windows anyway (AdBlock for one) - I never used the default channel to compare performance.
<br/><br/>
Pros.<br/>- Decent IPS screen.<br/>- Light weight and long battery hour (for me +6 hour is enough)<br/>- Crouton works pretty well. Xfce version has some problem but Unity version works well.<br/><br/>Cons.<br/>- Weak CPU (Just barely tolerable)<br/>- No delete key (I use this key a lot)<br/>- Function key number is not printed on the keyboard.<br/>- Keyboard is just so so.<br/><br/>On the second day, I already opened the case to check its upgradabiliy.<br/>No upgrade is allowed, it is a simply one-board laptop (except WLAN card)<br/><br/>I have used more than 20 different laptops models, but this one is pretty unique.<br/>I just learned 13.3 laptop is not large enough for daily use, which made me decide to buy a 15inch macbook next year.
If you had told me 6 months ago I would be buying a Toshiba laptop, I would have called you crazy. However, I found myself wanting something lighter than my MacBook Pro for traveling (particularly around the holidays), and did a lot of research before I pulled the trigger.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>* The full 1080p IPS screen is very nice. I work with MacBook Air laptops primarily in my office, and I wish they would incorporate this screen. True it's a bit glossy, but so are most TN panels out there, and most of them are not this resolution.<br/>* The CPU is plenty fast. Coupled with the 4GB RAM, I've never had any slowdowns with as many as 10 Chrome tabs and a couple of filesystem tabs open.<br/>* HD playback on YouTube is great. I haven't tested more than two videos at once (because why?), but two running side-by-side actually worked fine. Neither was fullscreen, but each was "HD."<br/>* This thing is dead silent. Since there are no fans, it's very pleasant to work on. It also never gets uncomfortably warm, despite the aforementioned lack of fans.<br/>* The keyboard is pleasantly clicky and the trackpad is very responsive. I'm more turned off by a bad trackpad than a bad keyboard, but honestly, both are generally pleasing to use for hours at a time. The trackpad is better than most modern Lenovo trackpads.<br/>* The speakers are really good. Again, coming from primarily a Mac environment, I'm actually shocked how much better these speakers produce sound than the MacBook Pro or Air. Fair warning - I'm not an audiophile, so my sound quality observations are from an untrained ear.<br/>* I happen to like the gray/silver, dimpled plastic feel. It's very grippy, and quite striking, even if it's not beautiful.<br/>* [EDIT] I recently added a 128GB SDXC card for media storage, and much to my delight, the card fits flush with the chassis. It's such a little thing, but it's exceedingly pleasant to maintain a smooth line with expanded storage; many $800+ laptops (looking at you, MacBooks) stick out and make them difficult to store without concern of damaging the card or port.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>* I'm a little disappointed by battery life. This is my personal, not-formal experience, but it feels like a stretch to get more than 4 hours out of the battery. I was hoping for more.<br/>* It doesn't feel particularly light, and there is a tiny bit of flex on the lid. It's not heavy and it's not creaking left and right, but I'd hoped for a bit more.<br/>* No backlit keyboard, but that's mostly a CHromebook complaint at large.<br/>* No built-in 4G<br/><br/>OTHER NOTES:<br/>* I haven't tried the video conferencing capabilities of this machine yet.<br/>* Switching between Google accounts once in the machine is just as simple as it is in Chrome or any other web browser.<br/>* Setup was remarkably quick; in fact, there was a problem registering my account for the free 100GB of Google Drive storage, and I had to factory reset my machine to get it to work. Process took under 5 minutes.<br/><br/>I bought this on sale for $270. With all the deals flying around, it was competing with a (then) $150 Acer C720, a machine which I have yet to try but which is excellent from most accounts. However, I can say with absolute certainty that this machine is worth the $270 I paid for it. It's my go-to machine around the house and when traveling, and unless performance plummits sharply for some reason, I expect that to remain the case for quite a while. Is it worth the $320 MSRP? I'm not sure, and probably not as a secondary laptop. However, I honestly think this could be a primary computer for someone cash-strapped who spends most of their productive time in a browser, and in that case, pay the $320 and get the screen, RAM, keyboard, and trackpad. The package is that good.
If you are search of a laptop running windows 10 and has an i7 processor for running Call of Duty 60 frames per second with a 3 hour battery life, this is ABSOLUTELY not the laptop your looking for. For me that's completely fine because what this laptop is supposed to do is offer a nice speedy browsing web performance and have a gorgeous display for it's $330 price-tag and it delivers. This thing is actually built pretty well. It is fairly light at right under 3 pounds and has a design that doesn't make it look particularly ugly. It actually looks quite nice.The keyboard and trackpad are quite a pleasure to use. They feel and perform great. For this price you actually do get a pretty well built laptop.<br/><br/>Probably the most interesting thing about this device is the 1080p IPS display and in a nutshell, it's FREAKING beautiful! It gets very bright and is actually visible outdoors! Viewing angles are great and it's a pleasure to stare at and admire videos and pictures. If you don't know what an IPS display is, it's a technology used that allows awesome viewing angles and a clear sharp picture. Most other Chromebooks (albeit the pixel, HP and a couple 11 inches) use a tn panel which results in a pretty mediocre picture and bad viewing angles even though it might have a 1080p resolution *Cough* Cough* Acer Chromebook 13 and Samsung Chromebook 2 *Cough* *Cough*. One warning is that there is a slight backlight bleeding which is common in IPS displays, but its hardly noticeable in nearly everything you do.<br/><br/>With this large, bright, beautiful display, one concern might be the battery life. Fear not, this thing is also pretty great at battery life. After 12 hours of use with the display at near full brightness and about 4 1/2-5 hours of screen time, it's rocking at 42% percent. It should last you a whole day of average work and movie watching. Speaking of movie watching, with this awesome display also comes  a great set of speakers tuned by Skullcandy. They are very loud and crisp and make listening to music or movies quite a blast.<br/>The processor is an Intel Bay Trail Processor which allows the device to be fanless (Sweet!) and to have that great battery life. It has a hiccup hear and there, but the majority of the time it runs quite smooth. Currently I have 6 tabs open and one is streaming music and everything is smooth as butter. This device also gets updates often which makes the performance a bit better the more you use it.<br/><br/>If you are on the fence looking for a Chromebook or a laptop that is consumer friendly and performs out of its price range, this is your guy. If you even have the slightest consideration in getting this, just get it. You will not regret it. An all in all great device with an awesome bright full HD IPS display, a pretty decent keyboard and track pad, an attractive build, a great battery, and in overall phenomenal performer for under $350. This is the best laptop you can get for your well earned bucks and it actually makes you feel like you got a bargain because you did!
Loved the machine (got it for my daughter) until it was just over three months old. At that time, the screen started to fail, first with a few vertical lines and then more, until the display ultimately died. I sent it to Toshiba for warranty repair, and was just told today that the LCD is broken and is not covered by the limited warranty (although nothing in the warranty itself either excludes or includes the LCD). Apparently, they think that we have damaged it, although the computer was treated well, just like a normal laptop. They now expect me to pay nearly $200 (2/3 the cost of the computer in the first place) to repair the screen. I will never buy Toshiba again.
Careful!!!  Product worked well for 2 months and then display went bad.  I contacted Toshiba and they refused to honor the warrantee.  The product was in perfect condition and never dropped or even scratched.  Their argument was that if the display was not working that it must be my fault as their displays are too good to fail on their own.  So if you are okay with getting a product without a warrantee, go ahead.  For me it was a very sour experience.  I will never work with Toshiba again.
I was incredibly disappointed with my Toshiba Chromebook. I bought my Chromebook in April 2015 from Best Buy. I used it probably less than ten times when, 25 days after purchase, the screen stopped working. I never dropped the machine or even moved it from my home desk. Best Buy looked at the Chromebook and said it did not have any evidence of user-caused damage and gave me a number to call Toshiba's customer service so that they could help me fix the issue. I called Toshiba that night and they asked me to send pictures and they would get back to me within 24 hours. I sent the pictures right after getting off the phone. Seven days and numerous contact attempts later, they finally called me back about the issue. They said they would not cover the damage since it was over 14 days since I bought the Chromebook! They said they understood that the damage was not caused by the user but it didn't matter since it was more than 14 days since I purchased the Chromebook.<br/><br/>Moreover, I am so disappointed in the customer service I received. The service representatives kept putting me on hold and then sending me to different representatives to talk to. They all said the same thing, that they understood where I was coming from and "would feel the same way" if they were in my shoes, but alas they could not offer anything besides advising me on where to go to take the Chromebook for repairs and that I would have to pay for repairs myself. The Chromebook was sitting on my desk and rarely used. I never even had the chance to use it away from my desk or outside of my apartment. It seems a waste to pay a hundred plus dollars to repair the screen when the machine is obviously just very poorly made. I plan on buying another laptop within the next month but will never buy another Toshiba product again.
I have wanted to get a Chromebook for a while now, but since my Windows laptop was working fine, I didn't think I could justify a new device. In the past couple months, I became very annoyed with the battery life of my Windows laptop and the weight (more than 5 pounds). I also became less enamored with my Nexus 7 (and tablets in general) and decided that I wanted to see if a lighter Chromebook could serve my casual surfing needs better. With the release of the Chromebook Pixel 2, I decided to jump in. It's worth noting that I had already moved all my files to Google Drive years ago and have had no problems adjusting to the limitations of a Chromebook.<br/><br/>When I received the $1,000 Pixel, I was immediately quite pleased. It had a great screen, great battery life, and a great track-pad. However, after a couple days I noticed that the WiFi was slow after I woke it from sleep (verified by speed tests). If I disconnected and reconnected, it would go back to normal. This was 100% reproducible. Having tested it with two other Chromebooks side by side, and on multiple routers, it seems that the Pixel I received has some flaw that causes slow WiFi. Google refused to acknowledge the problem. While I like everything else about it, I couldn't justify spending $1,000 on something clearly broken.<br/><br/>The next Chromebook I ordered was the Acer Chromebook 11 for $180. My first impression was fantastic. It was snappy and disposable. That might seem like a strange thing to list as a positive quality, but I actually viewed the shiny aluminum on the Pixel as a negative. I'm much more interested in a light and durable device that I don't worry about setting on concrete, a messy table, etc. I wasn't ecstatic about babying the Pixel for the next 5 years. However, after using the Chromebook 11 for a few days, I couldn't get over the horrible screen. It wasn't simply okay, it was terrible. And every time I opened the thing I noticed. If I used it for a little bit, I got used to it. But then I'd open the thing later, and my heart would sink.<br/><br/>I realized I needed a better screen, so I ordered the $300 Toshiba Chromebook 2. My first impressions were not overly positive. It was slower than the first two Chromebooks, and I immediately noticed that it could not handle 1080p60 videos on YouTube without stuttering. The track-pad was not as nice, and Chrome OS made everything tiny. But the screen looked good. You might be surprised that I ended up keeping the Toshiba. However, after switching between the three Chromebooks for a few days, I realized that I was happiest with the compromises on the Toshiba. The slowness wasn't that big a deal. I don't watch too many 1080p60 videos on YouTube. I figured out I could change the resolution with Ctrl+Shift+plus or minus, so when I wanted 1080p I could have it, otherwise I always have it set one resolution lower (this also seems to make it faster). I could put up with the track-pad. I decided to send back the other two Chromebooks.<br/><br/>I gave away my Nexus 7. I realized that there wasn't really a scenario where I wanted to use a tablet. Either a smartphone or a light Chromebook served my needs better in every situation. That or a big TV.<br/><br/>If you are in the market for a Chromebook, I recommend the Toshiba Chromebook 2.<br/><br/>Update: I've decided I want to add a description of my ideal Chromebook for Toshiba or anyone else that is interested. Basically it's a modified version of the new Macbook.<br/><br/>2 pounds (this is important. The Pixel is 3.3 pounds)<br/>Core M processor (so fanless but still powerful enough to render pages without issue)<br/>4 GB of RAM (it's difficult to need more on a Chromebook, I think)<br/>12 inch 1080p IPS display in a 3:2 aspect ratio (so not exactly 1080p but you get the idea)<br/>Chrome OS modified so if can handle the aspect ratio without annoyance<br/>16 GB of storage (I currently use 0 GB, and the only use case I plan on using is pinning a Google Play movie or two for a flight)<br/>Great keyboard and trackpad (but it doesn't have to be the best in the universe)<br/>Durable casing (I don't mind some matte plastic)<br/>The single USB type C port is fine (with the headphone jack)<br/>10 hour battery life<br/><br/>If someone built that for $1,000 or less, I would buy it. It saves money over the Macbook on the screen, the RAM, the storage, and the casing. So my impression is that this is totally doable.
So this thing is seriously the best computer I have ever owned.  I've owned a couple old XP Desktops, a windows 7 Toshiba laptop and a Windows 8 Convertible laptop and none of them can top this Chromebook.<br/>The build:<br/>- The texture on the exterior casing is really really nice, it keeps it from feeling like it's going to slip out of your hand, and makes the plastic more tolerable.<br/>-The keyboard doesn't have a whole lot of travel, but it is comparable to a lot of MacBook Air keyboards I've fiddled with.  It's not quite there, but it's definitely not bad at all.<br/>- The trackpad is fantastic!  It never misses a two or three finger click, it is equally easy to push down no matter where you press.<br/>- The hinge is really steady and hardly wobbles at all, which is definitely a good thing.<br/>- The display... Oh my word, this display is gorgeous.  It doesn't beat out the retina MacBooks, but it is as good as any 1080 panel I've seen.  The viewing angles are great, it has deep blacks and vibrant colors, A+<br/>- Speakers: The speakers are amazingly loud for such a compact machine, and for the price they offer very good quality, only distorting at very high volume.  They could afford to have a little more bass, but generally A+<br/>The Software:<br/>Chrome OS is fantastic.  It is my favorite operating environment.  Mac, Windows, and even Linux OSes don't come close to the pure simplicity that is Chrome OS.  The dock is great, clean effective, out of the way.  The application menu does just that, applications, no attempts at unnecessary eye candy or access to spots within other apps.  The menus are very easy to navigate, the settings area on the dock is well designed and intuitive.  It doesn't have anything extra and that translates to everything just working. I never have to think, "Man I hope my document saved" or "Dang it did I get a virus." Google has taken out all things that aren't necessary, and it is awesome.  The fact that this is so lightweight also translates to amazing battery life.  At half brightness with music playing I can get a solid 9 hours, and if I don't have audio and I turn the brightness all the way down I'm able to get nearly 13 hours of continuous use.  A few great features of chrome OS are the two finger horizontal swipe to go forward and backwards in a tabs history, the 3 finger swipe down for the "expose" feature, and the various hotkey combinations.<br/>All in all, this is my favorite device I have ever owned, 10/10 would recommend.
First of all price, the Amazon sellers are charging substantially above MSRP, but you can find a BigBox store selling for less than MSRP, with free shipping.  That's where I got mine.  The spread in pricing is significant.<br/><br/>As others have said, performance is fine, screen is great, and I'm glad I didn't settle for a smaller 11.6" model.  It's light, sturdy, looks good and travels well.  I have Linux installed using 'crouton', very fast although takes a while to adjust to the terminology.  Once installed, you can switch back and forth quickly with hotkeys.<br/><br/>Hardware is very good, but a few irritations.  Really missing a delete key, using backspace just doesn't do it for me.  The touchpad is integrated together with the left and right mouse buttons,  provides some interaction between fuctions that isn't optimal.<br/><br/>Probably the biggest issue is neither Chrome nor Linux handles the high resolution on a 13" screen very well, everything is just too small.  You'll have to set a lower resolution, which obviously defeats the advantage of the high-res screen.<br/><br/>Overall a very nice unit, one of the best available.  Totally quiet, and haven't noticed any significant heating due to lack of fan.  Wish the 16 gig flash were replaceable, since really huge modules are available now at attractive prices, but do appreciate the SD card being almost flush when inserted, unlike some of the competing units on the market.  The power connector is almost a loose fit, probably won't fall out, but not as snug as it should be.  Also it sticks out far enough to be a concern that it might get over-stressed with rough handling.<br/><br/>Edit  Dec 30:<br/><br/>After more use, really would have preferred a matt screen over the glossy.  Somebody claimed there's no glare, not sure what planet they're on.<br/><br/>Also first attempt at HDMI to TV didn't go well.  You can't see an open browser on the TV until you close the lid, normally you just get the background.  Also, scaling was not right, much too big to fit the screen.  I'll have to play around to see if that can be fixed.<br/><br/>Turns out problem with HDMI was caused by running reduced resolution on the computer screen.  Set it back to default full high-def and the TV displayed things correctly.  Maybe someday Chrome will handle these things better.
Simply phenomenal! Thank you Google and Toshiba.<br/>My Chromebook experience started with a little bit of a hiccup as it froze on "Determining device configuration"... Quick Google search and closing and opening the lid fixed the issue. Second setup attempt was a breeze. Then using Netflix would freeze the laptop and there was no sound and nothing would stream or play back anymore (including YouTube). Again, closing the lid and reopening would bring everything back, but after some time playing the movie the same would happened.<br/>So, googled around again and netflix and videvine plugins needed to be set to 'Always allowed'. I also changed the software to the dev channel. It's been working like charm ever since.<br/>The screen is absolutely awesome. I'm running Chrome OS in full 1080 resolution with the webpages zoomed to 150%. The UI items do appear small, but I usually use the "immersive" (fullscreen) mode so it's not much of an issue.<br/>I used to be a Firefox user before and two things which I'm missing are the Speed Dial extension which allows me to open predefined websites with Ctrl-1, Ctrl-2 and so on. I just have a set of sites I follow daily for news and events. Chrome does have a Speed Dial extension but I cannot do the keyboard shortcuts to open the sites or at least I haven't figured out how to do it yet.<br/>The other extension is the Zoom Page which does work perfectly each and every time. It scales up the website to fill out the whole screen and works without a glitch. The Chrome one is called iZoom or so and appears to be "temperamental" :-) Chromium and Google devs listening? Make it work like on Firefox or better yet build it straight into the Chrome browser as a feature and the Ctrl-1, Ctrl-2 as well :-D<br/>Summing up, love the laptop Toshiba.<br/>To make it perfect the Chromebook 3 could be made of metal, with an IPS touchscreen, 64GB SSD and an Intel I-something processor. Charge $500-$600 if you need to and you have a buyer. You can keep the same design as Chromebook 2. It's quite elegant and very light, just very plasticky. Maybe just make the touch pad symmetrical. Those curves at the top with slightly rounded bottom corners look a little bit odd :-)<br/>Keep it running the Chrome OS, if I need more out of the "Chromebook 3" machine I will just put Ubuntu on it running in Crouton.<br/>Chrome OS? Phenomenal! Boots in 4 seconds, resumes and goes to sleep in less than 1.<br/>I'm sure the Chrome OS devs will optimize it for the 1080 resolution in the future, it just needs some time.<br/>Summing up, I'm in love :-D<br/>Get your credit cards out people!<br/>So far I have not had issues with the performance, but that's maybe because I do not have 20 tabs open at the time. Usually 2 or 3 are enough for me. I do not play any games on it so will let the others judge how it performs in that area.
I spent about two months researching on Chromebooks to see which one to get. I am a web developer giving the Chrome OS environment a try with cloud-based IDE. I also heard Chrome OS has introduced a filesystem API which soon will allow me to connect to my sandbox server via SFTP. Anyways, this is my third day with it and here is my impression.<br/><br/>The fan-less design makes it comfortable to use on your lap although it can get slightly warm if you're watching videos for long periods or charging your laptop on your lap (why do that). I really like the fact that it's fan-less since my Acer Aspire S7 (dual fans) were very loud and obnoxious. I don't care how much faster the Acer Aspire was, it was too annoying to use.<br/><br/>Just to clear a few concerns that I had before purchasing this product, the lid was not hard to open, I can open it without using my fingernails. Originally, I thought it would be hard to open the lid but I was proven wrong the day I opened it. I am able to open the lid with one thumb although the base will lift up slightly if you don't hold it down gently. I was surprised on how easy it could open since I read some comments about it otherwise.<br/><br/>The keyboard has an excellent feel and I have no complaints with it, I think all Chromebooks have good keyboards. The track pad has a slight grainy feel to it, which I actually like because it helps me pinpoint areas on the screen with accuracy. I can see where some people may not like this though.<br/><br/>Battery life is good, I can get 7.5-8 hours on about 75% brightness and 9 hours on about 50% brightness.<br/><br/>Display is beautiful, I think this is what makes it the best Chromebook (other than the Pixel). But for the value, I'd say this product is clearly the winner. No touch screen though, which is okay for me. I have a hard time using touch screens on a 1920x1080 resolution anyways. With more android apps coming to the Chrome OS though, we might need it, I'm not that worried though.<br/><br/>I think the only complaint I have for this product is the performance which was what I expected going into this product. Honestly, the performance isn't that bad, so I'll try not to make it sound awful. I can stream Google play music, have my cloud IDE running and have several other tabs open (about 7 others). I also was able to run android apps like CloudMagic for my email client just fine but there will be slight stutters here and there when you have so many tabs open (I'd say 8-9 tabs). The stutters are only noticeable when you switch back and forth while other tabs are loading.<br/><br/>Other than that one minor complaint, I would say buy it! It met my expectations. I still would not go for a more powerful chip if it meant that a fan would be needed. I just love fan-less devices!
In my opinion, and partially due to the fantastic IPS display on the 1080P model, this is THE best chromebook currently available on the market for the price.  The keyboard layout is perfect for extended periods of typing (the Acer Chromebook 13 for example, has other keys touching the enter key on the right and the shift key on the left, making proper typing almost impossible without errors).  The touchpad is responsive and sturdy (I read a complaint about the bottom corners dipping lower than the rest of the touchpad, however this is normal.  You lightly touch the touchpad for a left mouse click, and press on the lower left or right bottom of the pad to drag and drop ... the temporary dip is normal as the lower corners act as a button).<br/><br/>Battery life is great, considering the bright, brilliant screen.  The processor is perfect for what this device is going to be used for (I have read negative comments regarding the processing power from people who have not even used the device ... you can't play gaming pc games on this device.  However, it will play music, videos and multitask with multiple sites open or apps without compromise.  Have I experienced a short delay loading a web page before I can scroll stutter-free while multitasking?  Yes.  Is this an issue for me?  No.  This is a long-lasting, fan-free device that sips battery juice, thanks to this processor).  As for charging times, this device will fully charge in less than 2 hours while power is off.<br/><br/>All of the other cool reasons for owning a Chromebook are factored into this device.  But I really have to emphasize the amazing ips display.  The screen is probably the most important spec on a device you will be staring at for hours on end.  And the Toshiba Chromebook 2 has a screen that does not cause eye strain.  I would recommend this chromebook to anyone.
The screen is beautiful. It's leagues better than any other chromebook or cheap laptop out there. The 1080p resolution makes it so much more useful for doing any kind of work. It's better than most lower tier premium laptops like the macbook air.<br/><br/>The processor though is bad. I knew going in that it wasn't going to be good. Reading other reviews around the web though, I was hopeful it would be mediocre. I don't stress my chromebooks very much and I thought mediocre would be sufficient for me - I typically only have 4-6 tabs open at a time and they're almost always text, I don't play games or use demanding extensions, if I'm watching a video I don't need more than one tab open, etc. But the baytrail processor in this thing starts lagging after only 2 or 3 tabs. Often when opening the 4th tab I find the address or search query I'm typing into the address bar lagging several seconds behind what I'm typing. Website scrolling starts stuttering.<br/><br/>It's very disappointing. The rest of the chromebook is mediocre to good. The keyboard isn't great, but because it's bigger being on a 13 inch model it is much more usable than the ones on the 11 inch chromebooks I've used (primarily acer c720 and first gen samsung chromebook). The touchpad took a little getting used to but after a few hours I was scrolling and clicking without any problems. The speakers are good for a piece of hardware in this price range, but you're always better off with headphones.<br/><br/>One very nice feature is how inserted sd cards are flush with the machine. This makes it very practical to add fast and cheap storage space to the 16gb ssd without having to be careful with the machine fearing you'll break off an sd card or thumb drive sticking out.<br/><br/>Overall, an incredible screen for the price, but a very underpowered machine otherwise.<br/><br/>I am debating returning it but will probably end up keeping it. I really want a high resolution affordable chromebook and all the other competitors out there are similarly performance challenged and have worse screens (and cost more.) It will serve my purposes for awhile, but every time I open a 3rd or 4th tab I'll be wishing for something better.<br/><br/>Edit on 11/7/2014: Ended up returning it. I just couldn't get over the lag every time I opened a new tab. It's probably the best overall chromebook on the market right now, but for anything beyond extremely light use I'd still advise everyone to wait until they release one with a great screen and at least a mediocre processor. I'm not sure what I'm going to get instead. Whatever it is it will undoubtedly be much more expensive unfortunately.
[Update: 4/19/15]<br/>This laptop is definitely my daily driver and it still runs perfectly fine. However, I've been having a lot of trouble with some physical defects on this machine. The problem with the trackpad that I mentioned in an earlier review is still as present as ever and I've noticed that my spacebar key will not respond sometimes. Parts of the laptop are also falling off... I've lost a screw on the bottom and a couple cushion blocks on the surface of the laptop. Overall, however, since it still runs perfectly fine I've had no problem with it. However, I think toshiba should do a better job with manufacturing this laptop and making sure parts aren't falling off after less than a year.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>I've been using this Chromebook for the past few days and have absolutely loved it. Everything is fast and the Chrome OS software doesn't limit any of the work that I usually do. I'm highly adjusted to working with the Cloud and Google Docs so this device was perfect for me. The keyboard and trackpad are also very good and responsive. So why the 3 stars? I've only put 3 days of use into this Chromebook and on Day 3 the trackpad has collapsed. I've spilled nothing on it and only put light use into it but the lower side of my trackpad seems to be digging lower than it should. Has this been a common hardware problem for anyone else using this device? The trackpad is still fully functional but the clicking rattles or is stiffer than usual.<br/><br/>Other than the trackpad defect (which I hope isn't a common problem shipped with every device), everything worked fine. I was thoroughly impressed with the software (speed, functionality, 1080p display) of the Toshiba Chromebook 2 HD.
I have worked with a great deal of consumer electronics in my life- I'm that guy that everyone asks when it comes to technology.  I was initially suspect of Chromebooks for all the reasons out there.  I took a leap of faith and bought a Acer 720.  For the value, it was a good unit and I was immediately sold on Chrome.  Following an unfortunate accident with the 720 last week, I decided to see what else was out there.  The 720 had an "okay" build quality and a "passable" screen, so I was interested to see if anything had a better setup.  I'm not looking for a $1000+ Chromebook, so the Pixel was out.  I read a ton of reviews, and was impressed by the Toshiba Chromebook.  However, based on some reviews out there, I was really concerned about performance.  Taking another leap of faith, I decided to try it out.<br/><br/>Wow.  I am typing on my new Chromebook 2 while listening to a Youtube music video playing in another tab right now.  I have 7 tabs open at the moment...  and I haven't experienced any performance issue yet.  Not only that, but the quality, screen, and feel of this unit is even better than I anticipated.  I can't believe I only spent $300 on this.<br/><br/>If you are debating on whether you should put in an order for this- do it.  You'll get all of the benefits of Chrome in a great looking, great performing package.
Great Chromebook! The screen is great, the keyboard feels great, and the track pad is great. Just installed Ubuntu through Crouton on it in order to get LibreOffice and add a little more functionality offline. How could I forget the amazing screen! If you are looking for a 13 in Chromebook this is THE ONE!
As an owner of the original Toshiba Chromebook, the Acer 720 and now this Toshiba Chromebook 2, I must say that this is definitely my favorite and an all around great machine.<br/><br/>The screen is absolutely superb.  Toshiba knocked it out of the park with this one.  The keyboard, touchpad and overall build quality of this chromebook is great, especially considering the price. This is truly a great value.<br/><br/>Some reviewers have commented on the sluggish behavior.  I don't see any difference in performance when comparing this to the other two I have.  I'm not saying it's not there, I just don't notice it.<br/><br/>However, I did knock off one star due to connectivity issues I've encountered in one of my locations at work. We have wifi throughout our compound, and my computer works great in most places but fails miserably in a certain room while all other chromebooks (Acer 720s) absolutely fly on the wifi.  The wifi signal just keeps going on and off.<br/><br/>I cannot figure it out; and this kind of scares me because I don't want this incident occurring at different places when I decide to use this computer as my daily driver.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, other than this issue, when you combine the screen, build quality and the efficiency of the Chrome OS, this machine is truly a winner.
Great computer.... I still have a Chromebook Pixel which spoils me quite a bit... but comparing the two side by side, this is definitely a 5-star product with value for the money... only negatives are no touch screen, no back-lit keyboard, and when you open the cover there's a tiny little piece of plastic that 'clicks' out just a tiny bit... but it's not annoying enough for me to have to return the computer... at least not yet.... can have a tiny lag, but I usually keep about 20-30 tabs open at a time on my computer.  On the positive side, the screen is glorious, the battery life amazing, the speakers are out of this world for a computer this size!  I'm a Chrome OS die-hard now and have slowly been switching out all computers at my ~100 employee business with Chromebooks and I can thank all the gods in this world for bringing a cloud-based computer to me... no more problems, no more viruses, no more spyware, no more worrying about losing documents, no more worrying about anything, and no longer a need for a network with a server that I have to maintain... I love you Google.
This ChromeBook pretty much gets everything right. Good hardware design, big display, IPS, sufficient RAM, capable CPU and much more. Check out my super long video review on this Chromebook here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Rl6Eqm5z8
What a fantastic device. This is what I was hoping for in purchasing a chromebook. The size, screen, build are top notch on the Toshiba Chromebook 2. The screen is what really sets this computer apart -- it's just a joy to look at. The only way to improve it would be performance-wise, as it does have the Bay Trail processor vs the new Haswell. That being said, a great majority of the time, the chromebook 2 is snappy and able to handle what I throw at it without lagging (it's still Intel!). It may not be as fast as my mac, but it's a 1/4 of the price. Plus, the slightly lower performance scores help with battery performance and keeps this device fanless (read: silent.). I'm thoroughly impressed with the chromebook 2 and would recommend this product to anyone looking into getting a chromebook.
It came with a display that stopped functioning after the first 2 minutes. Had to return it and lose money in the process.
I was planning to get the 4GB model to replace my HP Chromebook 14 (4GB Haswell model) so I would have the nicer 1080P IPS screen and a lighter package, but I was disappointed.<br/><br/>Positives are that the screen on the Toshiba is better since it's brighter and has better viewing angles and higher resolution.<br/>The size of the laptop is nicer (more portable and quite a bit lighter).<br/><br/>Biggest negative of the Toshiba is the performance on the web.  Too much audio and video stuttering and problems scrolling down pages that scroll silky smooth on the HP without having to wait for the page to load 100%.<br/>The Toshiba Chromebook 2 was able to play 1080P video, but it would glitch and stutter on many of these videos that played perfectly smoothly on the HP.  Often, it was just the audio that was glitching while the video played on, but it is still annoying and distracting.<br/><br/>Chrome OS is not ready for 1080P yet.<br/>Even though you can change the text size to 150% or more to make the web page text readable at this high resolution, that doesn't change the size of anything else such as right-click context menus and the address bar that still remain tiny.<br/>Google may eventually fix this UI scaling with a future Chrome OS update, but they can't fix the too-weak processor.  The lack of performance is just too annoying to live with.<br/><br/>I also missed not having the free T-Mobile 4G service the HP has to fall back on even though I rarely used it.<br/><br/>One other minor annoyance is the build quality in the area just below the trackpad.  If I accidentally press on this in the dark when meaning to click on the trackpad, it flexes and makes a cheap snapping sound that makes it seem like it will break or crack in that spot in the future.<br/><br/>I'm returning the Toshiba Chromebook 2 and waiting another several months for the next generation of Chromebooks come out before giving up the HP.<br/>Maybe by then, there will be a Chromebook with a great screen and great performance in one package.<br/>Right now, the 4GB Haswell version of the HP Chromebook 14 is still the best Chromebook for me despite the low-res screen and weight.
I have had this for 8 days.  My first chrome experience was the LG Chromebase, which I love!  Bought that a month or so ago.  Was hooked.  Gave up my Windows laptop for this Chromebook.  I love it.  It is light, typing is great, normal... no issues with keyboard.  Feels high quality to me.  I don't quite like the exterior but I don't see it when I am working on the laptop.  My daughter thought that I had bought a Mac Book Air.<br/>  The screen is beautiful.  I guess the 1080 doesn't scale so there is tiny tiny font.  Was an adjustment after the BIG BEAUTIFUL screen on my Chromebase, but I am getting used to it.  I have read there are ways to increase the font but I haven't figured all of that out; it's legible though. I am good for now especially just zooming in.  Processing speed seems fine to me. I do everything on the net... banking, remote desktop to my work computer, email, you tube, etc. I am not a power user, so I never stream 10 things with 20 tabs open.  I might have 5 tabs max and maybe music, but rarely.  Works perfectly fine for my use.<br/>  Sound is nice.  Sounds better than the big LG Chromebase (but I still love the Chromebase.)  Has all the necessary ports.  Also it is LIGHT. My goodness.  My hubby just a bought an Windows 8 laptop that is beautiful (but heavy), but boy I can log on soooo much faster.  He hates when his laptop powers all the down.  This thing is quick!<br/>  Oh, it does get warm.  Not as bad as my old Windows Thinkpad, but it is certainly noticeable on my lap when I am wearing shorts. The warmth and the tiny font are why I am giving this 4 stars. It's not perfect.  But, it is good enough... certainly for the price!  My hubby's Windows 8 laptop cost more than 2x as much.<br/><br/>10/14/15 UPDATE.  Had this a year now.  Was great.  Loved it. But NO LONGER!!!!  Hate it.  The screen stopped working.  It see gray lines when I open it up.  Lasts for about 5 minutes, then it slowly fades to normal. I moved the few things off the hard drive that I had there in case I totally lose the screen which I expect to happen at any moment.  Also,  occasionally, the colors start to change, bright pink, fuzzy, shadows, etc.  It's annoying and weird.  I am currently searching for a new chrome laptop.  I see other reviews here with screen problems, so be careful.  I bought mine right after they came out so I could not have known about the screen issue.  Now YOU know. DO NOT BUY IT.  Getting only one year of use out of it is unacceptable.
Please note that if you want to print directly from a chromebook, you should pick up a printer that is 'Google Cloud Print Ready' and have WIFI connection. Another way to print is if you have already a Windows/Mac computer currently connected to a printer, make sure both computers are signed in under the same email in the Chrome browser. That way, when you hit print on your chromebook, the Chrome browser on your Windows/Mac will print. For more info, google 'google cloud print'.<br/><br/>- Absolutely gorgeous screen. It's bright and clear. You can even adjust the resolution up to 2400 x 1350. People have complained about how small the words appear when viewing at higher resolution setting. There are two ways to address this, the first would be to increase the zoom by holding 'CTRL' button while pressing either '+' or '-' button to increase/decrease the zoom. Or you can hold 'CTRL' and 'SHIFT' buttons while also pressing either '+' or '-' buttons to increase/decrease the resolution. Once you find a specific zoom % that works for you, you can go into 'Settings' then  'Advance Settings' and under 'Web Content' select the % zoom you like for 'Page Zoom'. Once you set it, in the future when you open up tabs in chrome browser, it will go to that automatic setting.<br/><br/>- Sound is good. Loud and clear.<br/><br/>- I usually open about 10 tabs between editing documents, browsing the web, watch videos, etc. It's usually speedy and responsive. There are times when you'll notice a lag. However, it doesn't happen frequently and to the point where you felt like it's slowing you down.<br/><br/>- People have complained that it's uncomfortable to type as the laptop's edge, just below and along the trackpad is fairly sharp, as they type and rest their wrists on it. I personally do not find it to be uncomfortable.<br/><br/>- I find the build quality to be good and solid. And the trackpad to be fast and responsive.  I personally wish the keyboard have more travel depth to get a better typing experience, but it's good enough for this price.<br/><br/>- It boots and power off very fast!<br/><br/>- Since this is a chromebook, the one downside is that some peripheral devices/software that will only work with Windows and Mac will not work with it (such as dedicated scanners, more powerful photo editing software, programs that utilize Citrix, etc.).<br/><br/>- As with other reviews, the processor has a fan-less design and therefore it's quiet, and in my experience, not as hot as a regular laptop.
It's still early but so far i love it!  The display is amazing, gorgeous like you're on a retina display.  Some people have noted that at 1080 it makes the type small and hard to read.  This is somewhat true (depending on your eyes and preferences) but the easiest fix is go into settings and adjust web content where you can specify zoom.<br/><br/>As to the comments that the processor is lacking, perhaps it is but I can't tell.  i've had video going along with Pandora at the same time plus opened large PDF files and it was fine.  A very brief stutter in pandora when adding a new  tab.  Scrolling is fine.<br/><br/>I had to send back the Acer C720P because i couldn't bear to look at the screen, it was that bad.  If the Toshiba had a touch screen i'd marry it, but i'm still super happy.<br/><br/>edit: I still can't find any fault with the processor and this with many tabs open, music, video playing, etc.  Skullcandy Speakers are very nice.
My boyfriend bought this laptop and one day we were watching movies and go to bed the next day we wake up and the screen looks like it has been split in half. Looked like a cracked screen but a digital cracked screen. :/ At least there's a 1 yr limited warrenty- so I guess we'll shoot for a trade in repair or a replacement. Wish us luck. (I'd buy something a little sturdier-for the 300 dollar investment...didn't hold up very well- next time maybe we'll save a little longer to put down twice as much.) Plus we were a little disapointed the product with meshed with skullcandy.. my boyfriend has had experience with their flimsy headphones. :/
First, let me say: I assume anyone who is seriously looking at this particular product and comparing it with other Chromebooks already understands what Chromeboooks are, and what they can and cannot do, so my review is of this particular product is mostly from the standpoint of comparison with other Chromebooks.<br/><br/>I upgraded to this from an old 1st generation ARM-based HP Chromebook 11. I loved the IPS display on that laptop versus the TN displays on most laptops in this price range! The display on this laptop is even better, because the pixel density is a little bit higher, and it's surprising what a difference 11 versus 13 inches makes! The display on this laptop is simply GORGEOUS, and in fact, I'd even go so far as to say that it's probably THE best display you'll ever find on a laptop in ANY price range, short of the latest Apple Macbook Pros with the Retina display or the latest Dell XPS 13.<br/><br/>Apart from the display, the main reason I upgraded to this laptop from the HP C11 was because I was getting tired of all the lag on the HP C11. I will start by saying: The Bay Trail-based Intel Celeron processor in this machine DEFINITELY beats the ARM-based processor in the HP C11, hands down. It does still have the occasional lag, especially if you have lots of browser tabs open or if you're looking at pages with lots of heavy animations or Flash-based stuff, but it is at least bearable, especially if you disable Flash, which I've done here. Is it a speed demon? No. If you really want the fastest Chromebook out there, your best bet would be a Haswell-based machine like the Acer Chromebook C720 or the Dell Chromebook 11. I gave serious consideration to those as well, but in the end, for my purposes, the IPS display on this one won out over the TN-based displays of the C720 and Dell. I also like the fact that this machine is totally fanless, meaning there's absolutely NO noise, and no vents, fans, or heatsinks that need constant cleaning or periodic replacement.<br/><br/>I also like the Skullcandy-based concealed speakers on this keyboard. I was skeptical at first, but the speakers on this keyboard are noticeably louder and fuller than those on other machines, including the Samsung and Acer models.<br/><br/>The one thing (besides more speed) that I wish this machine had was more key travel on the keyboard. The keys on this keyboard have about 1.5mm of travel, which seems a little shallow for my liking, although they do have a nice amount of tactile bump. I LOVE the ChromeOS keyboard layout too, which eliminates a lot of the legacy baggage left over from the IBM PC, like the Scroll Lock, Num Lock, and underused Fn keys, which have been replaced with useful functions like volume control/mute, brightness, and browser functions.
Let's start with the good things.  The machine is beautiful and very well-built.  I switched from a Macbook Air 2012 model.  The keyboard and trackpad aren't quite as good, but almost.  Definitely good for the price and I adjusted within days.  And the screen on this Toshiba is awesome, outstanding, top-notch.  The machine feels solid and I've enjoyed using it.<br/><br/>You may see some negative reviews about the size of text or web pages on this screen.  But this is easily adjusted PER TAB by using Ctrl+ or Ctrl- and the browser remembers these settings.  I've actually come to appreciate adjusting the tabs to my personal preference and it is no big deal since you only need to do it once.<br/><br/>The bad:  There are known WiFi connectivity issues with this machine.  I wish I had read the Toshiba forums before I purchased it.  Wifi is quirky and won't connect easily to some networks like my Mac.  Even at home, I had to make router adjustments to get it to work and it has twice forgotten my network in the past 7 days.  Frustrating.<br/><br/>Even with 4GB memory (same as my MacBook Air), the machine is slow and often stalls (even with just 5 tabs going).  Fast performance was supposed to be a benefit of ChromeBook, but not this one.  My speedtests are usually fine - between 50mbs and 150mbs (I have TWC turbo).  But when it comes to doing searches or loading Gmail, it can sometimes take forever.  And, no, this is not limited to Google or Yahoo.  This is random with all websites.  Sometimes typing text into a search box in Amazon even takes far too long with the lag.  So don't try to stream a movie while your Gmail is open - the stutter will drive you bonkers.<br/><br/>I did a lot of research on Chromebooks before purchasing this one so I do not believe this is typical Chromebook behavior.  Toshiba has some problems here.  I am going to give it a few more days, but I might return this machine if I can't get it to perform as well in a browser as my 2012 Macbook Air.<br/><br/>UPDATE:  I followed all the steps the Commenter outlined and I appreciate the input, but I returned the machine.  If you plan to keep more than 3 tabs open simultaneously, this machine simply can't keep up.  My hope is that a beefier Chromebook with a nice display will be released later this year.
Right of the bat, this computer was as I imagined it would be. It is very light, well made, and felt very nice to use. The 1080p screen was beautiful in almost every way, and the keyboard felt easy to type on. Underneath the keyboard, Toshiba has equipped the Chromebook 2 with fantastic Skullcandy speakers. These speakers were wonderful to use, and extremely clear. The mouse pad was a little odd starting out, but I got used to it rather quickly.<br/><br/>The Chromebook booted very quickly, and was extremely easy to set up. As I began to surf the web, I noticed a few things I didn't expect from the device. Make sure you have a good wifi connection, because two rooms away from my router I did experience some strangely slow load times on pages. The processor was not something I was used to (being much slower than my desktop pc), but for school work and browsing this pc did very well. Now, some reviews will say there are many apps that work offline, which is completely true. The one problem I had with the offline use is that there aren't a lot of apps I particularly like to use. This is a fantastic pc for all around use, as long as you have a wifi connection.<br/><br/>Pros: Great feel of the pc, wonderful speakers, and a beautiful screen that make the cheap affordable price of the Chromebook 2 a perfect buy for anyone wanting the standard use of a pc.<br/><br/>Cons: A little slow for those who have used higher end desktops, and not as many apps on the chrome store as I would have hoped.<br/><br/>My final verdict, is that this pc is definitely worth the price. You get a well made and well working pc, for a very cheap price. I would recommend the Toshiba Chromebook 2 to anyone wishing to use the web and work on a document, but not to those wishing to game or are hoping for a perfect Windows/Mac substitute.
I was initially looking to replace my workhorse laptop, but realized that with CES around the corner, I could afford to wait a bit to get something that I wouldn't regret a month or two down the road. So I decided on a Chromebook for simplicity, portability, and efficiency. My main criteria for looking for a Chromebook were the following:<br/>Portability: physical size and weight. <3 lbs and as small a footprint as possible<br/>Efficiency: battery life to get me through a day of light browsing and music listening (at least 8 hrs)<br/>Good screen: good viewing angles, 1080p preferred<br/>Price: <$400 (any more, and I feel I should probably go ahead and replace my laptop)<br/>Power: Intel processor preferred, but not required<br/><br/>The Toshiba Chromebook 2 is a fantastic little machine that checks all of my boxes. I'll start with the reason I'm docking it 1 star: it does fold a bit under the pressure of multiple browser tabs. I half expected that, so I'm currently learning to work in fewer tabs.<br/><br/>Based on the time period I was searching (Dec 2014), there were a decent amount of options out there for Chromebooks. Toshiba, HP, Samsung, Dell, and Acer were the ones I kept coming across, but the Toshiba was the one to meet my requirements. I'll be honest, the size and screen are absolutely what sold it for me. Under 3 lbs with a 1080p screen. Wow. The The price was right, and so far, the battery has been more than capable of getting me through my everyday tasks (although with my job, I'm only around to use my personal computer 4 hours out of the day). I can go days between charges, and the system is always ready to use when I pop the lid open.<br/><br/>I don't regret this purchase one bit. I'm learning to work more and more in the cloud and inside Google's ecosystem. I'm actually looking forward to companies coming out with premium Chromebooks with high end processors and screens that can handle a full workload (the Pixel's battery life is what drives me away from it). Based on my experience with Toshiba and ChromeOS, I can see myself making a Chromebook my daily driver somewhere down the road.
Why did I give this thing 5 stars? Because 6 wasn't an option! I've been looking for a machine this size with an HD screen for years. Most of the time if I code from a laptop I just VPN into work or home and RDP to either dev box. I recently started using my MacBook Pro with a VM on it... but I still think it's far too large/heavy and if I have both a laptop/vm and another dev box I now end up having to check stuff in just so I can get latest on my laptop/vm and the reverse... So, it's just easier to remote in and code from the tower... which has 3 video cards and 6 monitors, thus why I use a full tower.<br/><br/>So that's my use case... Now, onto this Chromebook. I love the screen! It is absolutely amazing! The machine is also very light, about the same as a MacBook Air ( which I also own ). I've read some reviews that state they don't like the build quality or that it feels plastic/cheap. I don't really find that to be an issue. I really like the build quality, I mean.. it's not the aluminum build of a Mac.. but it hasn't been an issue for me and I'm pretty damn picky. The touchpad has a very light texture to it and I read that some people didn't like that, but I love it. Honestly, the texture is very subtle, if no one mentioned it .. I wouldn't have noticed and just marveled at how nice it was.<br/><br/>Speed wise, it's pretty peppy. I am only using it for VPN/RDP and normal usage. The only thing I noticed is that the RDP app I am using ... the only one available for a Chromebook.. is not quite as performant as a traditional RDP app. I don't think that is because of the laptop, but the software itself. I installed Linux on this thing and I about fell over when I found that it was still just as fast. Performance wise this thing is great. I'm not gaming on it or whatever, just using it as a terminal basically. However, it does do the basic internet games, etc. just fine.<br/><br/>So if you're like me and are looking for a lightweight machine, with a great display, that you can use for most normal usage and something where you can see a ton more code.. this box is for you.
Before I decided on this laptop, I was slightly apprehensive about buying a chromebook because I had seen mixed reviews of video performance and their performance in general. However, after several days of use I decided that I could write an adequate and honest review that could help someone else that is in the situation I was in.<br/>  First off the look is very similar to the macbook air, which is great. The fact that this computer at $329 looks and feels much like the currently $800ish macbook air is amazing. Of course, as it is a chromebook, it cannot perform some of the same functions a macbook air can but it does add to the cool factor. Also the frame of the laptop, while it is plastic, feels high quality. I haven't experienced any give in the plastic like what i had read of in other reviews from other people. Maybe theirs was defective but mine certainly is not. The laptop feels light as a feather, as it should, and does not feel like a low end computer.<br/>  The screen also adds to the 'premium' feel of the computer as no laptop anywhere near this price range can match its quality. The fhd display is awesome without a doubt.<br/>  The battery life advertised is an average of 9 hours and I found this actually, to my surprise, to be quite accurate. There's also a feature that estimates the amount of time you can continue use of it- at your current rate of consumption, which is also spot on. For instance, as I am typing this, my computer is at about half brightness and I have about 4 tabs open; my computer is at 22% battery life and an estimated 2 hours and 19 minutes of use left. If I change the brightness, open more tabs, or start streaming videos this estimation will update and adjust itself automatically.<br/>  Video streaming performance was definitely a top priority to me when I stumbled on to this computer. I was definitely worried that it wouldn't meet my expectations but I took a leap of faith and am very happy that I did. 1080p video streaming on youtube works nearly flawlessly, with only  a few instances  where some videos stuttered continuously at 1080p 60f/s. On those videos I just lowered it to 720p 60f/s and they smoothed out. This could also be attributed to my, at times, sketchy wifi connectivity and may not be the fault of the device itself.<br/>  I have no complaints on the keyboard and trackpad, they feel good and are a joy to use. If i didn't like the feel of the keyboard I certainly wouldn't have taken the time out of my day to write this overly long review.
I just received this product yesterday. So far so good. This computer is easy to set up, and right now Google is offering 1TB of free Google Drive storage for two years. It is more than I could ever use. IT is nice knowing it is there if I need it. I set up multiple users within minutes. I would definitely recommend a printer set up for Google cloud print. I have an HP 8620 eprint printer. It worked amazing with setting up Google Cloud Print and this computer. I love the Chrome OS. Compared to Windows 8.1 this machine is much faster. I would recommended a wireless or wired mouse for the computer. It is tough to "right" click on the track pad. You have to use two fingers, and I had a difficult time getting it to "right" click. I picked up a wireless mouse and "right" click works perfectly now. If you have an average knowledge of technology this machine is easy to get use to. I might not recommend it for someone who does not at least have an average knowledge of technology.<br/><br/>The one flaw I have with this machine is the font size of the web browser. I had read many reviews on this before I bought it and I had to adjust each web page to 125% to make it easier to read.<br/><br/>The screen on this device is amazing. I am glad I waited the two weeks for Amazon to get this machine back in stock. I had contemplated the Samsung Chromebook 2, but all the reviews I read about the screen were not positive. For $329 I am definitely glad I picked up the Toshiba.<br/><br/>For those of you who say this machine is only good for web browsing, you are wrong. I started a business and all of our reports for clients are based on Google Drive. This made the most sense to dive in and go completely Google. I am glad I made the switch. Do not be afraid to use Google Sheets and Google Docs. Google has really made a superior product.
I'm not going to repeat what everyone else has said, I'll just post my thoughts:<br/>Coming from a 14" 1440x900 Windows laptop, the screen size is PLENTY. If you are thinking 13.3" is too small, in my opinion it feels much bigger than it is. I thought 11.6" was too small which was why I chose this machine, but after seeing how roomy 13.3" can be I know I would be happy with a 11.6" with a similar screen.<br/><br/>The processor is not weak by any means. It can play Blu-ray quality video (1080p@20Mbps) with little to no issues. I don't see what the processor is incapable of doing for "power users" as I can't think of any common tasks that would require more CPU power. If CPU-intensive tasks are a thing you do regularly, you should be looking at Intel i7 laptops, not any of these chromebooks.
Another dissatisfied customer! I WISH I had read the reviews about this screen problem before I bought this! Overall, great reviews but almost all the bad reviews have had the same problem as me.  Internal crack, says Toshiba. LCD is very sensitive, says Toshiba.  Probably caused by a heavy object being placed on top of the laptop when it was closed, says Toshiba. Really? Most laptops travel in briefcases, go through security at airports and get jostled around in an overhead bin. Mine? Sat on my desk. The whole time. For 4 months. Not covered by warranty, says Toshiba. All I got was an address to send a formal complaint. NEVER BUYING A TOSHIBA AGAIN. Amazon, with 66 bad reviews for the same issue, you should really consider pulling this item from your assortment. By the way, don't try returning to Amazon, because you can only return things for 30 days after purchase.
This is a 3-1/2 month update on the Chromebook.  After only 3 months of normal use the screen started to fail.  The computer was not damaged, the screen failed from normal use.  Toshiba refused to repair or replace the screen under warrantee.  Unfortunately the computer is too light and its somewhat "flimsy".  Its not strong enough to adequately support the screen during normal use.  When we first got the Chromebook we were very happy with it (see original post below), but we've changed our mind and we no longer recommend this laptop.  Doing a quick search on google, it looks like this a fairly common problem with this model.  To replace the screen will cost about half the price of the laptop and its just not worth it.  We'll buy something a little stronger that can withstand normal use without failing.<br/><br/>Original Post:  - We got this for my wife and she loves.  Its light, the screen is near perfect and the Chromebook has so many useful apps, it almost makes her Windows laptop obsolete.  If you don't need heavy duty computing power, this is the laptop to get.  Great battery life, excellent screen and plenty of power for a Chromebook makes it an excellent choice.  -  After just three months of normal use, we've now changed our minds.  This product is not recommend due to is poor construction.
First off, my wife came home and said, "Is that a MacBook Air?".  If it had a glowing Toshiba logo on the back it would be a close copy.<br/><br/>I love this chromebook (but didn't love it at first).  First off, the consumer should never be forced to deal with scaling issues on chrome os due to a high resolution display.  Don't buy this to use as is unless you have superior eyesight.<br/><br/>That said, my workaround was successful.  Using Crouton I installed 'Trusty' Ubuntu with Unity.  Under settings -> displays, I set scale for menu and title bars to 1.25.  Under settings -> appearance, I set launcher icon size to 50.  For a terminal I downloaded Terminator and adjusted the font size for that as well.  Xterm can't reach a sufficient font size even on the huge setting due to the laptops high DPI.  In Chrome settings I chose a 150% page zoom with medium font.  Everything looks great (at the moment!).  System seems fast in Linux even with multiple tabs open.<br/><br/>I have a Asus C300 chromebook to compare against.  The Toshiba Chromebook 2 is better (my opinion) in all ways except battery life and price.
Summary:  My Toshiba Chromebook 2 was broken; I sent it back to Toshiba for repair; it came back 3 weeks later ... still broken.<br/><br/>My Toshiba Chromebook 2 was freezing every hour or so randomly and spontaneously rebooting itself.  I contacted Toshiba support; for $30 they agreed to fix it.  It was still under warranty, so the repair would be free; the $30 was for shipping. They then proceeded to waste a week of my time; it took them forever to actually ship me the box to send it to them in.<br/><br/>Eventually...3 weeks later ... it arrived back from Toshiba.  I quickly powered it up, logged in, and started to explore.  After 15 minutes it froze, locked solid.  But this time it didn't reboot itself.  After 15 minutes I had to hold down the power key to force it to recycle.<br/><br/>So ... I'm honestly not sure what to do now.  Should I send it back again, going without it for another 3 weeks?  Should I throw it in the trash and go buy a GOOD Chromebook from someone else?  Wow this is frustrating.ï»¿  The CB 2 is very nice ... when it works.  But when it doesn't Toshiba support is annoying, expensive ($30 for a 'free' repair) ... and ultimately the machine came back to me just as broken as when I sent it in.  Maybe I'll try the HP.
I'm buying Chromebooks and Chromebases for everyone I know.  When I hear someone is looking to buy a computer, I ask them what for.  They say to do email, surf the web, check Facebook, write some letters....nothing very technical.  I then show them the whole Google Apps ecosystem and suggest that a windows or apple computer is a complete overkill.  I'm betting that about 95% of most home users of computers don't need the whole computer or operating system.<br/><br/>This boots very fast, has a great screen, snappy performance, going to be perfect for my daughter heading off to college.  At her university, all professor notes are online, assignments turned in online, complete wifi over entire campus.  Why send her to school with a full-powered laptop when this will do everything AND make sure she never loses information as it is always kept in the cloud.  If she forget this back at the apartment, she can access all her work from any other computer anywhere, anytime.
I've been following the development of Chromebooks since Google announced the product category. The title of "Best Chromebook" typically changes weekly, but the Toshiba CB35-B3340 has held this distinction since its introduction. Toshiba was one of the earliest manufacturers of notebook computers and their leadership is reflected in this model. It features the best screen that's available on a Chromebook for less than $1000, along with a great trackpad, keyboard and speakers. Even the earliest Chromebooks still receive free, automatic software upgrades, so they have all the latest features available on the newest models. Google is constantly expanding this feature set too, like making Android apps available on Chromebooks. Even Adobe Photoshop is available on Chromebooks for schools and soon will be available to everyone. Buy a Chromebook because you'll love it. Buy the Toshiba CB35-B3340 because it holds the crown of "Best Chromebook."
Really great product that we were really happy about and then....<br/><br/>A minor but significant screen failure. 3 big purple splotches in the middle of the screen during black or dark backgrounds.<br/><br/>Then the nightmare of Toshiba Customer Service begins.<br/><br/>Toshiba needs to understand they are being measured against the service standards which Amazon has pioneered. Amazon has taught customers to expect immediate relief and satisfaction when they encounter a problem with a product purchase.<br/><br/>What does this mean?  Typically, when I have a product problem Amazon will send me a replacement within 1 DAY.  So Toshiba you have a tough standard to live up to.<br/><br/>So first I have to call  (yes call , not email , not fill out a simple form, I must call) toshiba customer service.<br/><br/>Then you wait...... wait ......wait<br/><br/>And then they answer and you do the usual mumbo jumbo about your issue.<br/><br/>Since my problem was a screen issue, they required me to submit photographic evidence.<br/><br/>So the customer service guy tells me to send an email with the photos attached. And then a string in the subject line (obviously meant to be read by simple linux shell script) and he reads to me on the phone something like this:  "Sir, in the subject line if you write tpsupport forward slash, (now he is reading out a 17 digit customer case number, 17 DIGITS, .......SEVENTEEN) , forward slash, Robin"<br/><br/>Ok so I send them the photos with the machine readable subject line (try getting Grandma to comply with all this BS) .<br/><br/>They promise to get back to me (yes once again a PHONE CALL)  within 48 hours. Which they do .......barely.....maybe....maybe a few hours late.<br/><br/>And then some guy calls me up and for about 20 minutes accuses me of breaking or damaging the laptop to the point where I just start getting opening angry. And then he spends another 10 minutes talking about if their service center has any suspicion whatsoever that I am at fault then too bad on your warranty and FY. And then he continues on with the blah blah about how I have to pay to send the chromebook to them and how its going to take a long time to fix the chromebook and , oh yeah, we might screw up your hard drive and you might lose all your data and are you really really sure you want to do this and on and on and on and on and on.<br/><br/>So exasperating and tiresome.  Toshiba just do the right thing and honour your warranty without all the BS. I understand the electronics business is cut-throat.  But , Toshiba, you are acting like a dinosaur watching the comet fall on your head.<br/><br/>So after all that , I now have an email where I have to "order" my repair. So it will take weeks if not months for all of this to be made right.<br/><br/>All of which Amazon would do in .....1 DAY.<br/><br/>Oh and to top it all off, I come back to this product page and find out that Amazon has pulled the Andon cord on this chromebook and is currently not selling it (see below message from Amazon on product page as of the writing of this review). Which means that many many people are having a problem with this product and TOSHIBA MUST KNOW THAT and they are still hassling me about honouring their warranty!<br/><br/>(Amazon andon cord message below)<br/><br/>"Item Under Review<br/>While this item is available from other marketplace sellers on this page, it is not currently offered by Amazon.com because customers have told us there may be something wrong with our inventory of the item, the way we are shipping it, or the way it's described here. (Thanks for the tip!)<br/><br/>We're working to fix the problem as quickly as possible."<br/><br/>Updated 6/1/2015<br/><br/>Went through the repair / warranty process.<br/><br/>TOSHIBA DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM AND OBVIOUSLY DID NOT TEST ADEQUATELY before returning to me.<br/><br/>They claimed to have replaced the "LCD Harness." Who knows.<br/><br/>One thing you do know.  Toshiba is a sub-standard provider.<br/><br/>Update 6/22/2015<br/><br/>Had to have yet another box shipped to me and then I shipped back the chromebook,<br/><br/>this time they did the right thing and replaced the screen and the chromebook is repaired.<br/><br/>So if you need a repair expect months till you are fixed and to send in multiple times to get it right.<br/><br/>Repair shop is Indiana.  Which is about the best thing I can say at this point.
Having owned a Samsung Series 3 Chromebook for 3 years, I just received my Toshiba yesterday and let me tell you how much more superior it is. The display is crystal clear. Sound is 100% better; Samsung sound was usually very low. Plus the Toshiba's sound actually has bass to it!<br/>Not to say the 3-year old Samsung wasn't a great machine; never had a problem with it in the 3 years I've had it. I've noticed how much faster the Toshiba is with it's 4GB RAM and faster processor. In my opinion, the processor is sized just fine for this Chromebook; I've played HD YouTube videos today and had absolutely no issues.<br/>If you're looking for a Chromebook that is fast, has a GREAT screen, great battery life, THIS IS IT!<br/>I do all of my work on a Chromebook and find it MUCH better than a Windows-based machine.<br/>Took five minutes to have this Toshiba Chromebook set up just like my previous Samsung.
Lightweight with a beautiful screen! I've had this for about two weeks now, and love it (even though I purchased it for over $400 from an Amazon third-party vendor).<br/><br/>I see some processor lagging when Chromecasting video and using multiple tabs at the same time, but that's not terribly surprising with the Bay Trail processor and other hardware specs. The battery life is closer to 5.5-7 hours, not quite the 9.5 hours advertised.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great computer for the price. I like it for home use (Netflix/Amazon video, fb, email), and light work use (gDocs, email, spreadsheets, multi-tab browsing). If I wanted to do anything heavy duty with it, or if my needs extended beyond browser use, I might consider waiting for the next gen Chromebooks w/ Intel i3 or better chipsets coming in 2015, or spending more for a mid-range Windows comp.
I bought from Best Buy instead of Amazon because was not sure about Chrome experience and wanted to be able to take it back easily. The computer lasted 24 days. Too late to return..Aargh.<br/><br/>The Chrome experience ? excellent<br/><br/>The laptop before it failed? excellent<br/><br/>The fact it cfailed after 24 days? Loose one star, things fail<br/><br/>The fact I now have to pay $30 dollars to repair a 24 day old computer? zero stars if I could give it.<br/><br/>I will never buy another Toshiba product. Period.<br/><br/>update 07/16/15. This just keeps getting better. I paid 30 bucks for Toshiba's specialized box to send the computer back in. Took a short vacation and discovered Toshiba required a signature on delivery FOR AN EMPTY BOX!!!!???<br/><br/>Fedex has now sent the empty box  back to Toshiba because no one was home to sign for receipt. You cant make this stuff up
Never thought I would buy a Chromebook but my PC has been slowly dying for the last six months and has become more trouble then it's worth. What attracted me to the toshiba chromebook 2 in particular was the great quality 1080p screen (which outperforms my $650 PC's any day), the 13" form factor is the perfect compromise between screen real estate and portability, and the Intel processor has more than enough power with the 4 gb of ram to do anything you need it to. Also the lack of a fan is a nice touch making the laptop completely silent. The only con I've found is that the battery does not last as long as they advertised but it still outlives my PC by a good 5 hours so its not a huge con to me. This has become my main computer that I use for everything except for printing.
Just got mine today. The screen competes with my 6 year old aluminum Macbook. The keyboard felt just as good as my macbook. For bacic web surfing and light productivity work it seems more than adequate. I think Toshiba designed the aesthetics pretty well. I really like the look and feel of this thing. After I finished using this for the first time, I kept thinking to myself "Why would I want to spend over a thousand dollars on a macbook." I'll know in 6 years.
I've had my Chromebook for about 10 days, all I can say is I'm totally satisfied with the function especially the screen quality. The Baytrail processor is more then up to the task of what I do with this Chromebook. I generally have up to ten tabs open at a time, stream Netflix, Youtube, listen to Google Music play. I heard other users complaining about the processor but I can't say I had any issues. If I had one negative is the battery last on average about 7 to 8 hrs, but then again I stream a lot of content. So if anyone is sitting on the fence (like me!) get the Toshiba with the IPS and 4 GB of memory. One more thing, Amazon.com shipped my order to Canada because I wasn't able to get the IPS version of this Chromebook in Canada, Amazon delivered 6 days early!
I never write reviews on products, however I feel that this laptop is one of the best choices I have made in a long time with tech. I have a nice Windows PC that I use for audio production and just needed a laptop for doing homework and surfing the web. The Toshiba Chromebook 2 is by and far a great choice for someone who is looking for simplicity and functionality in a beautiful package. The keyboard is one of the nicest I have typed on. The display is stunning and rich. I have experienced no lag with pulling up sites or chrome apps. I cannot recommend this device enough. Kudos to Toshiba for getting this right.
I ordered this and got it shipped to the UK with an estimated delivery date of 17th November but was pleasantly surprised when it arrived on the 11th - almost a week early! Amazing service from Amazon/UPS!<br/><br/>This Chromebook really is an excellent all-round portable computer. It is light and has a nice form factor. While it isn't as sexy as something more expensive it certainly looks quality and well made. The textured cover may not be the most aesthetically pleasing but it is very practical - it makes the chromebook really easy to grip when picking it up and putting it down.<br/><br/>I really like the keyboard and find it nice and comfortable to type with. It would be nice if it was backlit but hopefully that will come in future iterations of the Toshiba Chromebook.<br/><br/>If you are reading this review then I am sure you have read plenty of others and are well aware at this point that it is the screen that sets this chromebook apart from the competition. It really is a beautiful display and the Full HD resolution makes all the difference. Text, images and videos are sharper and there is much more space to be productive. Some have complained that the icons are quite small at this resolution on this size screen but I haven't found this to be an issue (although I can see how some might). I should add that the sound on this device is also very good for a small laptop. Don't expect much base but it is loud and clear - great for watching videos and listening to music.<br/><br/>I am a software developer and primarily I use windows PC's for most of my work-related activities. Having said that, my company makes heavy use of the Google ecosystem - google drive, docs, gmail, sites, etc so ChromeOS was a natural progression for me. Coming from a Windows background there is so much to love about ChromeOS: the speed, the simplicity, automatic updates and the fact that all your settings and data is just synced to the cloud. The fact that you can factory reset your device, sign back in and within 30 seconds have it automatically resynced exactly as it was before it was factory reset is just awesome. I also love the way Google syncs accounts and data between different device.<br/><br/>In terms of performance, which is a legitimate concern with this chromebook due to the choice of processor - I have been impressed. I have installed ubuntu with unity via crouton as there are some development tools that I really do not want to be with out and the performance is actually very impressive. In ChromeOS at the moment I have 6 tabs open, including spotify playing music and in ubuntu I have sublime text open with a couple of files and I can switch between the two and do my work instantly and with no lag at all.<br/><br/>I honestly think in terms of value for money this is unbeatable. Its ideal for browsing the internet, emails, watching videos (think netflix, youtube, etc), listening to music and working with googe docs and sheets. Even better, however, is that with the fact that you can run linux side-by-side with ChromeOS you can run some of the more traditional desktop applications that are still not available for ChromeOS.<br/><br/>If you are contemplating buying this then just make sure you do your research and ensure you understand ChromeOS. ChromeOS is a beautifully elegant Operating System that is becoming more and more relevant in the modern world with the way we work and play but there are limitations and some very high profile software suites are not available on it. It is also worth taking the time to learn the different shortcuts and other tips and tweaks that are available.<br/><br/>Once you have done your research just buy it - it is an excellent product and you certainly won't regret it.
Toshiba's really made a statement with their newest Chromebook. They've put a focus on what really matters the most in a Chromebook: the display, and battery life. There's not a lot I can say that hasn't already been said, so I'll cover the major points.<br/><br/>The display is a jaw-dropper. It's really that good. There simply is nothing better in a laptop at this price point, period. It's bright, the colors are vibrant without being over-saturated, and it's razor sharp. There are only so many superlatives I know, but this display covers most of them. You will not be disappointed when it comes to the display's quality.<br/><br/>The battery life is also exceptional. Under light use, Toshiba's advertised nine hours is easily achievable. Heavier use will of course see less longevity, but it will still outlast most other laptops on the market.<br/><br/>As to performance, I'd say it falls firmly into the category of "above average." It's not going to beat one of the Core i3 models, but there has never been a time where I became impatient with it. Certain things like large PDF documents can challenge it, but those are the exceptions, not the rule. I'd much rather have the extra battery life than have a web page render a few tenths of a second faster.<br/><br/>If there's one con in all this, it's that certain Chrome apps don't play very well with the page zoom function. This is a very pixel-dense display, and Chrome OS hasn't quite got display scaling figured out. Many people may want to apply a default page zoom (I use 125% myself). Some apps, like the built-in calculator, don't know what to do with this, and wind up being unusable. These are very rare exceptions. The vast majority of apps work just fine, and I haven't had any difficulty with websites.<br/><br/>Right now, I'd say the B3340 is the best bang for the buck in Chromebooks. One potential rival is HP's new Chromebook 14, which packs a 1080p display and Nvidia's new K1. The HP, however, is $100 more expensive. Acer's 1080p Chromebook is more expensive and uses an inferior display. Sasmung's 1080p model is more expensive, uses an inferior display, and uses a slower ARM CPU.<br/><br/>The best choice in that crowd becomes pretty obvious, I think.<br/><br/>-- 2014-04-17 Update --<br/>It's been a while, so I'll update a couple of points. The scaling of apps was addressed recently, though I can't say it was entirely positive. Apps now ignore the global zoom setting, though some are now a bit too small (and don't offer a way to zoom in). The new calculator app works very nicely, though.<br/><br/>There really isn't any new competition in the FHD Chromebook market. All of the other 1080p models make use of inferior TN panels, and cost as much or more. ASUS' new 10" model will have an IPS display, though (though not 1080p, obviously).<br/><br/>No issues to speak of otherwise.
This was my 3rd Chromebook. My favorite was an Acer C720. It was a great computer. I upgraded to this Toshiba for the HD 13 inch screen, and better build quality. However, pixelated lines were running through the screen after 3 weeks. I question the build quality of this computer. Amazon accepted the return no problem thankfully. It could just be a lemon, but I will probably go back to Acer or Samsung over Toshiba. Also, the battery life was not that great.
I have now had this Chromebook for 2 weeks and could not be happier. I am a graduate level student making the change from a windows laptop. I was lured in my the computers price, weight, versatility, simplicity, and battery life and the TCB2 delivered on all fronts.<br/><br/>I'll touch some points that have not already been covered in other reviews (I'm looking at you "The screen is amazing" people")<br/><br/>To start, the ChromeOS and battery life were key considerations. For the most part, Docs serves all my needs when writing papers and taking notes. Seeing as documents are saved to Google drive there isn't a need to save files to a flash drive when I move to a school computer to print; all i need to to is log in and there's my paper. Document fonts are basically entirely compatible and I haven't ran into any issues when turning in an assignment. If you have a Google account, you'll see they give you 15GB simply for having an account. There is the option to opt in for the 100 GB for 2 years but I'm currently saving that for a rainy day. From what I can tell, a Flash drive and or SD card will do the trick if you would like more on-board space for maintaining documents.<br/><br/>As for the battery, during regular school type use (taking notes with occasional web surfing on medium screen brightness) I am getting around 9+hours of battery life. Switching from a 15 inch HP that maxed out at 5 (8 if I turned off wifi and screen brightness on low) this is INSANE. A charge lasts me all day. As for recreational use (surfing, streaming music and youtube/netflix) I'm getting around 5-6 hours which is still beyond adequate. As I write this review I have 2 tabs open, one being Amazon and the other being youtube and it says I have 91% and 6:24 of battery life left. =<br/><br/>Speakers were also a big deal since I spend a decent amount of time watching videos for school, as well as my own entertainment...while there isn't a ton of bass (which laptop does? unless it has beats) the volume is LOUD. Louder than you expect and definitely loud enough to fill a room.<br/><br/>As for the 4 GB ram, you don't have much to fear. If you use your laptop in a similar fashion you shouldn't have an issue with multiple tabs and videos/music streaming. For reference, I generally keep 5-7 tabs open and unless I have content heavy pages like several pages for fantasy baseball and videos, I run into little to no lag.<br/><br/>The key board is very respectable. I saw reviews that knocked it's construction but if you aren't a keyboard snob, you won't have any issues.<br/>The build is plastic so getting a case won't hurt (this is basically a must for any computer).<br/>The weight is other worldly, comparable to a MB Air (the screen also stacks up as well. Because of the 1080 ips screen, default font's do appear small but with some changes to the settings, this can be "fixed".<br/>If you already use Chrome browser, you'll be happy to know that all your settings will appear without any prompt or set up (favorites/passwords etc).<br/>The boot time is also ridiculous. From a cold boot, I can be up and browsing in under 20 seconds guaranteed.<br/><br/>Just some quick follow up notes:<br/>The webcam is alright, not fantastic but if you aren't on google hangouts much yet, this isn't an issues. Supposedly Skype is currently working on a add-on for chromebooks.<br/>The charger is over 10 feet long......more than enough.<br/>The back near the screen can get warm with prolonged use but it's not nearly enough to burn you. Probably couldn't soften a marshmallow.<br/><br/>That's all I can think of right now, but all in all, I could not be happier. I do not think a better value CB is out there.
I like many other people searched until my fingers flew off researching the Chromebook field.  A little background.  I initially had two Chromebooks (11.6 Samsung and 14 HP) just after they were released and at that time I really enjoyed them but felt that I probably needed something bigger.  I invested in a 13" Macbook Pro  and am very happy with it however... like most average consumers I do 90% or more of my computing using a browser.  The other 10% is done on my Macbook Pro and really that's only to edit photos (and I can do that just as well with a browser based app).  I now store my photos on a personal external HDD and up in the cloud, this makes sharing so much easier.  My new Samsung 2 arrived.  Un-boxed and plugged in for 30 minutes and battery was full charge.  Opened it up and WOW!  This display is awesome.  Very bright and colorful.  This HD IPS display is really something else.  My previous ones were the normal dull low resolution models which were fine but this one stands out.  Yes it looks like my Macbook Pro and you know I think it manages the web faster!  The keyboard is solid and very easy to get used to  The track pad is find but has a bit of a rough surface (it's not glass) but responds just fine.  This Chromebook looks great, is light weight, quite solid for being a plastic body, the sound is above average and the web camera can take a decent photo.  For a 13" Chromebook this one rocks.  It looks and feels even better then my Mac.  I'm very happy and excited to be back in the Chromebook seat again.  I'll keep the Macbook because it has an optical drive so I can copy our old VHSc tapes to disc.  By the way, I've been on this all evening and the battery is still at 86%.  I'm glad to be back with a Chromebook and  I'm very happy with this Toshiba!
Screen lasted one week, then went blank while reading a web article. After reading customer service experiences here I returned it for a refund. Never again with a Toshiba.
The pros:<br/><br/>* The screen is mostly on par with my 2014 MacBook Pro Retina. It's WAY better than what you would get on a MacBook Air. It's really, really, REALLY good.<br/><br/>* The speakers on this Chromebook are loud and have great range. Perfect for jamming.<br/><br/>* It's about as light as a MacBook Air and definitely lighter than a MacBook Pro.<br/><br/>* Its keyboard and touchpad are surprisingly fantastic. The touchpad on this Chromebook is miles better than touchpads shipping on laptops that are hundreds of dollars more expensive. The keys on this keyboard are responsive without being mushy. It's great for multi-hour typing sessions (i.e. document writing or programming, both of which I do on this machine).<br/><br/>* It has a LED on the side to tell you when the laptop is charging or has finished charging. This is handy.<br/><br/>Now, the cons:<br/><br/>* It feels cheaply made; the quality of this case is about what you'd expect for a $300 laptop.<br/><br/>* It's not that fast. It struggles to keep up after having a few (5+) tabs open, but not in a way that impedes work completely.<br/><br/>* No auto-brightness control. Again, $300 laptop.<br/><br/>I sold my MacBook Air in place of this device and do not regret my decision one bit. If you need a machine for web browsing or light work (i.e. not Photoshop or "hardcore" software development) and don't care too much about build quality, then you can't do better than this machine. Given its price tag, I'd even recommend it over a Pixel, since the only difference between them is a touchscreen, lots of metal and ~$700.
Had wanted a Chromebook with a high resolution display for awhile.  I use a Chromebox as my desktop, with a high resolution monitor - ChromeOS loves high res.  Unfortubately, most Chromebooks ship with a paltry low res display, why?!<br/><br/>When this came out, it had good specs and a high resolution display - so far so good.  Samsung and Acer also have a model with a high resolution display too, but both of those are dull and subdued in use.  I was disappointed in both of those.  This TOSHIBA however, has not only a high resolution display, but it's also IPS.  Sold right there.<br/><br/>Does real life live up to the specs?  Yup, the display is absolutely beautiful.  Wide viewing angles, lots of room for working on documents, deep rich colors and plenty bright.  Performance is as expected, quick and responsive.  I haven't noticed much of a delay even with 10-12 tabs open.  Streaming Netflix, Amazon Prime and YouTube are all flawless.  It even streams to our Chromecast very well, and much smoother than our older ChromeBox does.  The keyboard was a good surprise, it feels really nice to type on.  I wasn't expecting a great keyboard on a low cost laptop like this, but the keyboard is a joy.  The Trackpad is very responsive and much smoother than the one on my work PC (windows).  The Trackpad works well, but I prefer a mouse so I'm using a Microsoft Bluetooth mouse and it's working perfectly.  I haven't measured battery life, but it makes it through a work day with ease, with plenty left over for some videos to wind down with at the end of the day.  Best Chromebook I've used.
When I was searching for a new laptop, I looked from MacBook's to Windows laptops, to even touch screen ones. As I expanded my search, I came across this laptop listed here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KMRGF28/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B00KMRGF28&linkCode;=as2&tag;=newcams-20&linkId;=7QFFS2KLA55IQ5UQ<br/><br/>The laptop lised above seemed to be a good laptop but eventually I returned it because I didn't like all the extra apps with it; I just thought it was a hassle. Then I got this Toshiba Chromebook. This Chromebook has been everything I hoped; a cheap, attractive laptop I can use for web-browsing or as a secondary work-station. Although you can't install 3rd-party programs like Office or Photoshop, I've not had trouble finding apps and extensions in the web store for everything I need to do, and I'm still barely scratching the surface. The touchpad is very responsive once you've learned the motions, the keyboard is quiet, the screen is clear and readable, and the body looks great! Battery life is solid, unless you're leaving it open for long periods of time while working on something else, and the computer boots up and shuts down in less than 5 seconds. I also love that if you have an existing google account, you can be up and running within two minutes taking it out of the box, and the UI is clear and simple to use.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm delighted with my Chromebook, and I'm sure that as Google continues developing Chrome OS and more developers add apps and extensions to work with, it will become even better at everything I need it to do.
Until I got a Chromebook 2 Chrome OS to me was a good idea that didn't work in practice.  I had a Samsung model through work and it was not an acceptable replacement for a traditional laptop at all.  It was slow and the screen real estate felt so cramped that doing work on it made me long for a "real computer" so I could get things done.  I liked the idea of Chrome OS, but all of the other models I looked at seemed to compromise some aspect that was important to me.<br/><br/>This model has a beautiful screen that is clear and crisp.  The downside of the resolution on a 13.3" screen is that the text is tiny, but I just adjusted the page zoom to 125% and it works for me.  The upgraded processor and RAM compared to earlier models makes all the difference.  This machine's responsiveness is snappy.  The ability to just open the laptop and start working without waiting for the OS to wake up feels like a tablet, but without the limitations on viewing websites or doing word processing that seems to come with an iPad or Android tab.<br/><br/>The build quality is solid and the machine feels sturdy and inspires confidence. I did have a screw from the bottom come loose, which is concerning, but as a practice matter I tightened them all down and don't see a reason to worry about that again.  I have no problems with the keyboard, but I have never been very picky about them.<br/><br/>With Chrome OS you are still limited with power heavy tasks like photo or video editing, but for web browsing and word processing (so long as cloud based solutions like Drive work for you) this thing is a champ.
I've been thinking about going very basic lately.. I own an iPad Air 2 and an iPhone 6 Plus but didn't have the cash to strap myself down to buy a MacBook... I thought to myself.. What do I need my computer to do?  A.) I need to be able to consume a TON of media B.) I need to be able to write a paper for school and C) I need something solid to work on when I really need to be productive, crunch numbers, or work on slides.<br/><br/>When I thought about it - I could get all of that with a MacBook for at least $1200 with bare minimum specs... OR I could purchase a Chromebook.<br/><br/>Fast Forward!  I've owned the ChromeBook 2 Toshiba for about two weeks now and it's honestly the best computer I've probably ever owned.. The fact that I can get a 1080P display for under $300 is AMAZING!<br/><br/>This machine flies, it can multi-task well, and it has Google Docs which is outstanding!  If you need MIcrosoft Office - you can do Office Online which works... the same way sorta... You're better off using Docs anyday.<br/><br/>No, it doesn't have iTunes, or can it install anything for Windows, or Mac... You have the Chrome Web Store where you can install many apps including Facebook, eBay, Spotify etc.<br/><br/>The speakers in this device are fantastic!  The screen is bold, and beautiful, colors are crisp and the color panel is spot on.  It runs cool, and the battery life is tremendous.<br/><br/>Save yourself the cash and buy this Chromebook 2.  You won't regret it.  The reviews on Amazon speak for themselves!
When i was looking into computers i wanted to purchase i never thought that i would ever buy a Chromebook. Coming from a 3 thousand dollar desktop  with 2 solid state drives running in raid 0 and an overclocked i7-4790K. The performance on this thing is astounding when you see the specs which it has you've just got to remember its running Chrome OS. Chrome OS is really easy to get around i have a nexus 9 and 5 plus my desktop windows 8.1 or 10 depending. It took me about 10 minutes to get my head inside out the system.<br/>Pros:<br/>-Crazy good screen although scaling is rather awful (updates coming)<br/>-Keyboard is pretty good (typing with it now)<br/>-Touch pad gestures are good (although rather coarse)<br/>-NOISE (i had an alien-ware m14x before this and its so much quieter thank the heavens)<br/>-Heat (up top it stays cool just down bellow gets a little warm)<br/>-SD card sits flush<br/>Cons:<br/>-Webcam is horrid (coming from a c920)<br/>-mSATA would be nice! But the little emmc does the job<br/>-Back lit keys would be good. But for 400 its crazy good deal<br/>-Inbuit pdf reader is horrible i often open up 400 page pdfs and they take ages to load (download NOTABLE pdf reader its great much better than inbuilt)<br/>Tips:<br/>Only been using this thing for like a week so i dont all that many but download notable extension will help a great deal.<br/><br/>Contact for any other question : e.doggger@gmail.com
Love the sleek design and the click-touchpad. The size and weight are very manageable without extra frills. The screen is gorgeous for this small of laptop, especially for only $300! The external shell of the laptop is very reminiscent of a Macbook Air, just rough plastic instead of overpriced aluminum. The speakers, located underneath the keyboard, can go very loud and still retain clarity (but have a complete lack of bass [but hey, they're laptop speakers]). The on-board bluetooth easily recognized my LG HBS700 headset. Nice and snappy-quick right out of the box. If you like the idea of owning a Nexus phone versus a Samsung Galaxy (no pre-installed bloatware and needless frills), then this is the laptop for you. I highly recommend!<br/><br/>The only drawback I have noticed so far is that the laptop can get quite hot on your lap when the charger is actively charging in the battery. Once the laptop is done charging, the laptop quick cools off and the heat level is barely noticeable.<br/><br/>Note: One of my perceived biggest drawbacks to getting a Chromebook was the inability to download torrents from sites like PirateBay and TorrentFreak. I was able to find the Chrome App "JSTorrent" on the Chrome Web Store and it solved this problem. Works like a charm and doesn't contain the intrusive ads and rootkit installs that uTorrent has. Also highly recommended!
I loved everything about this product until I plugged in headphones.  It made a super loud noise and shut down the computer.  I tried other headphones with the same result.  Then even without headphones it it would not work properly.  I am not certain if i just got a lemon but I would check the headphones things right away upon receipt!
Dissapointed with the hardware and Toshiba customer service.<br/><br/>I use this computer very lightly, it sits on a desk and is used for general web browsing most evenings. It functions well, the UI is intuitive and I really like the Google Drive storage space for 2 years that comes with it. While I didn't have grand expectations for a $300 computer, persistent hardware failure and wasting time with Toshiba customer service has left a bad taste in my mouth - I think money is better spent elsewhere.<br/><br/>2 months into owning the computer, the display abruptly stopped working. After roughly 1.5 hours on the phone with Toshiba, they instructed me that I'd have to pay $30 to ship the computer to their US Repair Center and the turnaround time would be 7-10 days. I received the computer back 2 weeks later. Upon opening the box, the track pad no longer worked - the display was fixed, but the track pad did not.<br/><br/>After another hour on the phone with customer service, they informed me that it had to be sent back to the US Repair Center. They waived the shipping fee, but refused to expedite shipping or turnaround time on either end (in a scenario where Toshiba is at fault).
I had actually ordered the 4GB version of Acer's CB13, but poor reviews and a delayed release led me to cancel that order and get this instead.<br/><br/>I went from a 4GB C720 to this bad boy and am pretty happy. I have had it for a couple of days now and I really love the screen. The fact that it is IPS is pretty great, but really the only thing I cared about was getting a 1080 screen. If you do a lot of remote desktop tasks you will be really happy with the resolution.<br/><br/>Compared to the C720 I feel like this is a decent second chromebook. You can definitely tell the CPU does not pack as much punch at times, but the high res screen makes up for it. Construction and material quality are about on par with the C720; although I am not sure if I am too thrilled with the textured cover. At least with the C720 I knew I was getting a cheap toss around device, but the Toshiba seems to have higher aspirations that are just not realized...<br/><br/>For now I would say this is the current best Chromebook out there for under $400 (I guess under $1,000 as well).<br/><br/>Give this thing a go if screens are more important than processing power.
This is my very first review for any product I've bought from Amazon.  I bought two of these, one for me and one for my wife.  I work in IT as a software developer and use PC's at work and dread the slowness (with 16GB of RAM!) but at home this is my go to machine.  The ability to open the lid and be surfing in seconds is amazing.  I can do everything I need to on this machine and for those times when I want to do some actual coding I have installed linux side-by-side that I can switch over to instantaneously.  The screen is beautiful and the processor seems to be fast enough for my needs although I would have paid a little extra for a slightly better processor.  My wife loves hers as well...the only thing she can't really do is play some of the games she's gotten accustomed to on Windows, but the pros greatly outpace the cons.<br/><br/>I think the best thing about this machine is the FUTURE though.  There are big plans for Chrome OS, the app ecosystem is growing everyday and the ability to run all android apps is approaching.  I couldn't be more excited to see where this is heading in the next couple of years!
When I first unboxed my Chromebook 2, I was suprised at the build quality. What I thought was going to be a plasticy cheap feeling device was, instead, a robust, lightweight, and stylish laptop. People at work keep confusing it for a MacBook Air.<br/><br/>That's were the Apple comparisons have to end though because the screen on this device smashes that of the Air. I can't speak kindly enough about this display. It is . . . . . outstanding! The display coupled with the clear, powerful speakers (for a laptop) make it an ideal device for watching Netflix, YouTube etc.<br/><br/>The processor, the Intel N2840, is a fanless design which means it is completely silent. It's not going to win any benchmark awards but I have never found it to be lacking, even when I'm using it for work with about 10 tabs/windows open and two accounts running. I would rather have this CPU and keep the excellent battery life, than have an i3 with less time on the clock.<br/><br/>If it is a Chromebook you need, don't look any further than the Toshiba Chromebook 2 (Full HD model). It. Is. Awesome.
The screen is great.  Very bright and sharp. Using Crouton installed Linux without any problems. Trackpad is better than most I have used.  I needed something small and light for an upcoming conference and had the Acer Chromebook 13 on pre-order.  When I saw the Toshiba, I cancelled the Acer and received the Toshiba ahead of the projected Oct 5th date.  I couldn't be happier with this.  With Linux, this is a fully functional notebook for $330.  Fantastic.
I love this new Chromebook! It's larger than I'm used to, and therefore more heavy, but the trade-off is that the resolution on the screen is GORGEOUS. I love how the colors look, and how HD video looks on this screen. It's bright, can easily be dimmer for low light conditions, and has a responsive and quiet keyboard.<br/>I'm also impressed with the sound - usually built-in speakers on laptops are not that great, but I enjoy the sound on this. It's also very easy to Bluetooth connect to an external speaker - in my case an Oontz Angle. I can play music or video with ease.<br/>Battery life should also be noted - it's EXCELLENT. My previous Samsung Chromebook had a decent battery, but this one is truly robust. I get about six solid hours of heavy use out of it, including playing YouTube videos, streaming Netflix/Hulu/Amazon Prime, emailing, browsing, and playing music.<br/>I LOVE this Toshiba Chromebook!
Finally a Chromebook with a great display.  I also tried the new Acer Chromebook but the cheap TN display was horrible.  Even though it was also high resolution display.
Excellent product at a great price. I purchased this for my wife because she kept stealing my Macbook Air and she actually likes it better than the Macbook. While it is obviously not built as well as the Mac it is nonetheless very nicely built for the cost. The speakers are very loud and sound great, the screen is very crisp and clear, the keyboard is laid out similar to the Mac and works well however it doesn't have backlit keys. The touchpad is also similar to the Mac and works very well. The battery life on this is also excellent which is key for my wife since she can never remember to charge it! It is also very light weight and easy for her to carry around if she wants. If you spend most of your computing time on the internet then this is an excellent choice for you. It might not be the best option for business use and definitely not for hard core gamers.
All I can say is "WOW!"  Imagine a laptop that does EVERYTHING I need it to do, (watch Netflix, Facebook, E-mail, Pandora, ect.) That doesn't get viruses, 0 boot time, 0 shutdown time and never gets hot, does not have an annoying fan noise constantly and comes with a 100 Gig hard drive for a year free?!?!?!?!!!?!  Not to mention an incredible HD screen and VERY good sound?!!??!!??!!?!<br/><br/>As I familiarize myself with all the google services it becomes much more clear how efficient and useful my Chrome book is.<br/>I also want to mention the ABSOLUTE AWESOMENESS of Google's 800 number help line.  Simply the Finest tech and customer service experience I have ever had (and that includes Apple).  If your on the fence, don't hesitate.  Its the best electronic device I've ever purchased.
The user who did the long long review convinced me to buy this and Im glad I did, I was becoming frustrated with apple products on many levels and I love everything but one thing about this chromebook, I gave it 5 stars as it does deserve it but in the next few years when I will prob have to replace it TOSHIBA take note Id like you to add a disc drive to watch DVDs and blu rays, the screen on this is first class, what a waste that I cant do this, yes I can watch netflix but if I dont have a wifi connection I cant, still gave it 5 stars as apple ipads dont either, you wont be dissapointed I guarantee:)
I've had a few Chromebooks before this Toshiba 2, including the Pixel (fabulous....WAY overpriced) and for the money this Toshiba is unbeatable. Not saying it's perfect because it needs a faster processor, but again, for the money, this is a killer Chromebook, and if you're already into Chrome, it's a great laptop as well.<br/>Every review-able item/part/idea/process about this machine--barring the processor--is great: screen (OMG), keyboard, speakers, trackpad, build quality, connectivity, and on and on. I researched the Chromebook world for weeks. Love my choice!<br/><br/>Edit 2/20/14: I remain very impressed with this Chromebook (the screen in particular), and I believe it is a great machine for the price. The only negative I mentioned in the first review was processor speed. Unfortunately, that turns out to be an issue for me, despite having a very fast internet connection and router. The screen is set to middling brightness on auto, and when you turn it up to a brighter setting, the already slow-ish processor slows down even more. The first Toshiba Chromebook used a faster processor than this one has. What's up with that? I still like this machine, but this is the last Chromebook I'll buy without a Core i3 processor or better.
I bought this as a gift for my dad and got to use it for a couple of weeks. This is a very good laptop replacement for the price. Screen is bright and clear, overall construction is sturdy and internals have enough juice to drive typical web applications. It is light and runs cool and quiet. Battery runs a good 6-7 hours on high brightness. The chrome OS learning curve is not steep. My dad got a hang of it in a couple of days. I will consider buying this for myself when my current laptop is ready to retire.
I have to say that I love it. I'm not sure if I can find a bad thing to say about it really... It's fast, the screen is crisp, and it's really light. If you get the keyboard shortcuts down, then you'll be pretty set to do any task. It doesn't have a CAPSLOCK key and that takes some getting used to. The OS is a browser. If you're buying this or any other Chromebook, then you need to read up on what that entails. I like it a lot and this is DEFINITELY worth the 330-350$ I payed for it.
Probably the best invesetment I have ever made in a Laptop. For 330 $ I can do everything I ever wanted as a current Master Degree student, Google Docs are a great compatible replacement with MS Office. Boots up in seconds, can play all type of music and videos.<br/><br/>Screen is amazing, Sound is amazing, Trackpad is awesome, keyboard is very solid. The processor is FAIR and runs almost anything I put at it, I can go with 20 tabs with no problem. Highly Recommended !
The screen failed in less than 2 months.  When I called Toshiba they asked me to send photos of the screen and computer, which I did immediately.  After several attempts trying to get a response they finally told me the screen was physically damaged and was not covered under the warranty. I never dropped or damaged the computer. If it was damaged it was during normal use.  Bad product, bad warranty, bad service.
This review is after just a few hours of use.  The screen is better than my HP chromebook 14 for general use.  But, when I stream a TV show full screen - it is fantastic - bright with vivid colors.  The viewing angle is much less sensitive - especially vertically.  The font size of text is smaller than on my HP chromebook 14, but no problem.  The screen is a SUPER upgrade.<br/><br/>The sound is excellent.  Sound is clear and with good volume.  Radiating up from the keyboard seems to be an excellent design.<br/><br/>The computer is MUCH lighter.<br/><br/>I can notice slower speed with 5 tabs open.  Both the HP chromebook 14 and this Toshiba chromebook 2 have 4 GB ram - so the speed difference is the difference in processors.  So far, it isn't an issue.  I often run with 5-8 tabs open - if this becomes a problem, I will update the review.  To repeat: I can notice a slight slowdown with 5 tabs open compared to my HP chromebook 14, but it is not enough (yet) to complain about.<br/><br/>Switching to a new chromebook from an existing is totally trivial.  Setup WiFi.  Login.  All the "installed" stuff came back.  All the bookmarks. Most of the Settings (they missed the international English keyboard and the second language of Spanish).  All the documents, music and videos in the cloud are obviously still there.  I knew that nothing from DOWNLOADS would come back.<br/><br/>I am now down to turning on my Windows machine about once every two weeks.  Going back is really frustrating.  Chromebooks just work better.
Touchpad failed, the mouse cursor disappeared and I couldn't get it back despite multiple powerwash, etc. Saw online that others with the same issue had to send it back for repairs. Luckily I was still within the return window for amazon. Disappointing. I know these are cheaper, but the quality could certainly be better.
This is my honest review of the Toshiba Chromebook CB35-B3340. I purchased this laptop (YES, IT IS A LAPTOP) over a month ago via a different outlet after catching it on sale. I spent countless hours researching Chrome OS and the best Chromebook available for my needs, and narrowed it down to this one. I have to say that I should've jumped on board sooner. I have used it at home, while traveling, and around town. I've yet to encounter an issue to speak of as far as it meeting my needs.<br/><br/>This Chomebook is gorgeous. You already know it has the full HD display and 1920x1080 resolution, and it looks great with the brightness turned up or down. What you may not know is that the speakers in this machine are incredible. They are clean, loud and balanced, coming from under the keyboard. I did not expect much from anything labeled "Skullcandy", but I am pleasantly surprised! At max volume, it will fill up a room with no problem.<br/><br/>I have found myself using my Chromebook every day. It's so much more convenient than turning on my WIndows laptop, waiting some absurd amount of time for it to boot up, and then waiting even longer for it to become useable. I open the lid on this thing, and within about 2 seconds it's ready to roll. The battery is lasting me right at 8 hours on a charge (with Bluetooth turned OFF, I have no use for anything Bluetooth but YMMV). In short, everything just works. The 13.3 screen, even though I expected otherwise, is plenty big. I'm a big guy with big fingers, but have no problems typing on it without error. I do keep the browser at 150% zoom, as it helps me see everything a little better and seems to bring most web pages into focus  better. As for internals, it runs smoothly and silently thanks to the SSD. I can easily open 10 tabs at once without any stutter in performance.<br/><br/>The only issue I had this this machine whatsoever was the spacebar, as any laptop manufacturer is prone to in my experience. If I did not hit it directly in the center, it would not respond. I simply used the older trick in the book, I popped off the spacebar and applied a small piece of scotch tape to the center which raises the bar enough to solve the issue. There are countless videos available to show you how simple it is to do if you encounter the problem.<br/><br/>Chrome OS may not be for everyone, but for the average user such as myself it is perfect. I live in the Googlesphere as it is, I am a hardcore Android guy. Google is constantly integrating Android apps and features to the Chrome OS, and more will be coming down the line. Do not hesitate to give this Chromebook a try. Whether you intend to use it for light web browsing or music/streaming, this model is perfect.
We have been doing the PC laptop rotation every few years and this spring when our latest PC slowed to a snails pace, my wife asked for a Macbook.  I knew that this would likely set us back a grand and decided to do some research on other options.  The Chromebook seemed like a perfect option for us: stable operating system, ease of use, lightning fast response, and you can't beat the price.  Chromebooks are the way of the future; everything is connected and web/cloud based which is where the Chromebook thrives.  We couldn't be happier with this Toshiba.  There are a few limitations, but overall this is by far the best laptop we've ever owned.  Its easier to use and quicker for most tasks than a Macbook.  Another feature we love about the Chromebooks in general is the how you can swap users.  My wife and I both use the same Chromebook and it is incredibly fast and surprisingly convenient to switch between our user settings so we don't have to close tabs or interrupt what the other is doing.  This also makes it easy if you let someone else use the chromebook.  They can quickly sign into their Google account and they can't access any of your information/browsing history/etc.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Super quick<br/>- very simple to use<br/>- perfect size keyboard (seems larger than most Chromebooks)<br/>- Screen is bright and larger than other Chromebooks (also HD)<br/>- Convenience of swapping between users<br/>- Lightweight<br/>- Sturdy<br/>- No internal fan noise (doesn't have a fan)<br/>- Doesn't get too hot on your lap<br/>- Good Audio<br/>- Battery Life<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Can't use software that has to be loaded onto computer<br/>- Google Cloud Print is a pain to set up (but works well once set up)<br/>- Keyboard doesn't have a 'End' or 'Delete' Button<br/>- Keyboard not backlit
I don't use this computer; I bought it for my sister.  She seems to like it just fine, though.  Here's some general knowledge, though, for the uniformed shopper...<br/><br/>First, let's discuss the pros and cons of this chromebook relative to other chromebooks (except for the Pixel, which deserves to live in its own universe).<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-The screen is great.  This is one of the best displays that you can get in a chromebook.<br/>-The 13" form factor and all the good things that come along with it.  (More screen real estate and more room for the keyboard and trackpad.)<br/>-4GB of RAM.  Do NOT buy a chromebook with 2GB of RAM.  The one spec that matters more than the rest is RAM.  With 2GB of RAM you will definitely experience some significant lag if you've got ten tabs open at once.<br/>-Price.  There are $200 chromebooks out there but you should not buy them.  In my (relatively educated) opinion, $300 is the lowest price that you'll find for a chromebook which can function as something of a reliable every-day machine.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Processor.  I won't say that the processor is BAD, but it is pretty average.  This is a real computer processor as opposed to the lower end chromebooks which have the equivalent of cellphone processors but it is a step down from the core i3 processors that you can find in some other chromebooks (at a similar price point).<br/>-The 13" form factor and all of the bad things that come along with it.  (Namely lower mobility.)<br/>-Toshiba.  I have a lifetime of bad experiences with Toshiba.  I chose to give them another chance (although it will be my sister's problem) because of this computer's features but I have never experienced a good Toshiba purchase.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about chromeOS.  The first and most important thing to realize is this: you can perform any task you might want on chromeOS but you probably can't perform them with the same software you used to use.  Need to write a paper?  You don't have access to fully functional Microsoft Word (though there is a partially functional Chrome app for Microsoft products) but Google Docs will write you a paper.  (Microsoft Word has more features but the features on Google docs work better.)  Need to listen to music?  You don't have iTunes but Google Play Music works great.  Need to edit a photo?  No Photoshop but Pixlr has a lot of features (and there are several other options in the Chrome Web Store).  You get the point.  There's nothing that I've tried to do yet that I haven't been able to do.<br/><br/>Here are some other thoughts about chromeOS.<br/>-If there is any specific software that you need (for your job or for school or whatever) then buy a different computer with the appropriate operating system.<br/>-With chromeOS you get the chrome web browser and that's it.<br/>-You can't install anything.  Websites and chrome apps can replace most programs that you need but the one big bummer is that you can't install print drivers.  I haven't tried Google cloud print.  The bright side, though, is that it also means you can't get a virus.<br/>-The local storage is weak but you have access to cloud storage.  Google drive is native and works great but you can now get dropbox, as well.  Word on the street is that other cloud storage services work, too, but I haven't tried them.<br/>-You can do more offline now than you could several years ago but don't let Google's advertising fool you; a chromebook loses the majority of its functionality without internet access.<br/>-A chromebook makes a wonderful coffee-table-computer but it can also make a suitable everyday computer for the right person.  In fact, if you've only got $300 to spend then you're better off with a chromebook than with any of the terrible Windows devices available at that price point.<br/>-Battery life on a chromebook is wonderful.  This Toshiba is the third one that I've purchased and the first two get between 8 and 10 hours of battery life unless you're constantly running Netflix or something.<br/>-Your whole chromebook experience is tied to your gmail username.  Let's say you use your computer for a year and then reformat it.  (For a chromebook it's actually called "powerwash.")  You will lose your local files but your username will remember your settings, apps, bookmarks, and etc.<br/>-If you know what you're doing you can install a version of Linux alongside chromeOS using software called crouton.  It works flawlessly.  (It is not a "dual boot" situation.  You can actually have both running simultaneously and switch back and forth between them.)  Linux adds a whole new world of functionality to your chromebook experience.  It will let you install most any open source software.  (For me, that's how I use LaTeX.)
this is a chromebook. you cannot download programs as such. you cannot use most functions offline. there is very little onboard memory. having said all that, if you know what you are getting, this machine is fantastic. it is super light, slim, quiet, extremely long battery life (11 hour, tabletop gaming sessions take it to the wire on a full charge, screen on the entire time). add some memory either in one of the usb ports, or the sd slot for saving files offline. i keep all my pdfs for gaming on the card as a backup, and on the cloud. it is super fast. 3 seconds to start up from full dead, blazing on websites. runs netflix, hulu plus, hbogo, prime video, on and on with minimal lag or buffering. i use this machine for entertainment consumption, and tabletop gaming needs.<br/><br/>it has a nice secondary bonus, they dont really mention. i use chrome exclusively on my large gaming pc at home. as a result, i can remote into my pc from anywhere with a wifi connection. this means playing WoW or SWOTOR at starbucks with no lag. the fact that the chromebook itself does not run these programs is moot if you have a pc and a wifi connection. i leave my pc in the den, remote into it from my living room, plug in the hdmi, and instantly i am playing swotor on my bigscreen in hd.<br/><br/>this is not a machine you want if you are looking for high end spreadsheet, or word processing use. you can do both those things, with a wifi connection, but you lose many of the finer tools in excel and word. and while adobe is out, there are several excellent pdf apps that work just fine even offline. there are some glitchy things that happen when using a linux machine on certain websites (downloading music from amazon means you cannot queue them all. you must select them individually as each one finishes). but all in all, especially for the price, i absolutely love this machine.
The time of the chromebook is here, and they are here to stay, and this is the one that makes that statement true.<br/><br/>Please bare in mind as you read this, if you don’t already know, that chromebooks are not regular laptops, they do not have the ability to run your mac or pc games because they run their own OS based on linux. You CAN get a full functioning computer if you install linux on the machine, but linux is not for everyone.<br/><br/>But to the product at hand, Toshiba has managed to hit it out of the park with this machine. For $300-ish you get a productivity oriented laptop that is seriously, blazingly fast.<br/><br/>The SSD drive ensures lightning fast boot up times and the rest of the hardware, from the Celeron Processor to the 4GB of RAM keep it going fast. In fact I have yet to find any situation where the hardware can’t keep up. That is with two videos streaming and a large PDF file open. And it never skips a beat.<br/><br/>To top it off you get a battery that, at 8 hours, likely has more endurance than 90% of the users that will come across is. And then you have that screen.<br/><br/>The screen is everyone’s talking point, and believe them. It’s really that good. Great viewing angles, great power for use in daylight and the built in power level keys for it let you dim it down to near invisibility at night so it doesn’t burn holes in your retina.<br/><br/>Sound is good with invisible speakers that are behind the keyboard, good for a laptop anyway… and able to put out surprising volume<br/><br/>Input is easy with a nice keyboard that invites typing. The only gripe I have about it is that the space bar will not actuate reliably if you press the farthest left end of it. I normally use my right hand to press the key so in reality the problem almost never crops up.<br/><br/>This has replaced my windows laptop in 90% of use. And the 10% use it doesn’t see constitutes programs that can’t run on Chrome OS like Adobe Photoshop. This, I feel, is one of the few limitations of the design, and they are getting better everyday. Chromebooks will eventually take over, it’s only a matter of time.<br/><br/>I really don’t have a single bad thing to say about the Toshiba Chromebook 2. Any limitations it might have are due to the nature of a Chromebook’s design philosophy and not to the hardware. It has been designed to run Chrome OS flawlessly, and it delivers on just that. At this point, and for this price, you would be hard pressed to find any laptop of any kind that is as fast and as gratifying to use as this. I strongly suggest you purchase one and join the new revolution.
I have alot to say about this product but I'll try to keep it short. I bought this because I wanted something different from the Windows machines that I've always been used to. The prospect of such a device as this is quite appealing. So far I have a lot of pros for this device. 1. Battery life. It's incredible! The first weekend I had it I went camping and used it for 10 hours straight. It was amazing. Even had enough power to last on standby the next 3 days until I realized I hadn't plugged it in after the trip. And it still had 10% left! The screen is absolutely amazing on this device. The resolution is clear and the picture looks fantastic from any angle. I bumped my down a resolution so things would be bigger how I like them but that was just personal preference. I switched from an HP Pavilion laptop I bought in 2010 to this. That thing was like a fire when it got hot. It was beautiful aluminum but got super heated. It was also starting to get a tad slow. I didn't know how I'd feel not having a disc drive but I honestly don't even miss it at all. So far I've overcome every obstacle that I've hit with the Chromebook. Couldn't print. Picked up a cloud print enabled printer at Goodwill! Could edit PDF's. Downloaded an extension. Hated Word online. Used Google Docs and saved it as a word doc! You can really overcome anything you can find with this device. I don't miss any of the complexities of a Windows machine. It's just as fast as my laptop was. The screen is a bit smaller but I honestly don't notice. The pages load fine. Not as fast as some I will admit but for such a basic computer it's very quick. Never had problems watching videos or listening to audio. Speaking of that, the speakers are phenomenal on this device. I mean top notch. They sound incredible and are completely hidden within the laptop. Don't know how much Skullcandy had to do with it but they did a good job. This thing is seriously light and thin. It's amazing really how small and light the device is. Fits anywhere well and is always comfortable. This thing never gets hot. I use it for hours at a time usually and sometimes if I put my hand on the bottom I can feel a little warmth but never anything I even notice on my legs. Again amazing. I bought a 256GB SD card to go with this to have for external storage but I haven't even begun to fill the internal drive so I'm not worried. Plus you get 100GB's free from Google Drive to use so there's no worries. There are a few applications I wish were available for this that aren't but that's really more of a developer problem than Google's problem. There isn't a good Flixster app to save your movies in to watch later offline. And there isn't a Spotify app to save a playlist to to listen offline. These are 2 big ones that need to get on the device quickly. I know Adobe is working on an online version of Photoshop for anyone to use but it hasn't been released to the public yet. That will also be a game changer for this device and those that want to work on photos on it on or offline. Overall I give this thing 5 stars because of the ability to overcome all of the trials I've put it up to. It's truly a fantastic device. This is the computer of the future. As more and more things are going to an online base we'll see more and more things become readily available for this device. I'm excited for that day. Hope this helps in your buying decision!
Looks like a 'keeper'...got the device yesterday, today I peeled off the tags ;)<br/><br/>This HD version replaces my 1st generation Toshiba 13.3 Chromebook. My 86 year old mother-in-law was thrilled to become the new owner of THAT one last night, replacing her aging, "virus-magnet" desktop Windows PC. Having owned and used that original Chromebook for just over a year, I admit giving it away was bittersweet. The original Toshiba is a terrific, FAST Chromebook...noticeably faster and smoother, for instance, when scrolling through a Facebook or Amazon page full of images than the HD version. Otherwise, the HD IPS display is such a huge improvement over the standard display. It's definitely a really nice upgrade. Once I had adjusted the default zoom level to produce text that my eyes could manage, it was non-stop smiling. But it was the smile on Angie's face, and the big hug I got when we left her with her gently-used original Chromebook, that told me I had found a very happy new owner for it.<br/><br/>The whole Chromebook experience is wonderful. I had created a Google account for her about a year ago, shortly after I purchased my first Chromebook. I was already mapping a strategy to get her on a Chromebook some day and knew this would be a key ingredient in making it simple when that day came. The trips that her grandson and I were making to her home, responding to the calls to "fix my computer", and the obvious frustration she was experiencing, were the motivators.<br/><br/>If you're already a Chromebook user, or you've started your homework and considering purchasing one, you know that everything you touch on a Chromebook (except the option of storing files locally) including your setup configuration, essentially lives in the cloud. So launching a new Chromebook for the first time is simple. Start-up to configuration was probably 3 minutes on the new Chromebook. The only gotcha was a remote desktop error when trying to connect remotely to my Windows laptop. It soon occurred to me that I was probably running an old Chrome OS on the new Chromebook. An update took another 3-4 minutes. Bingo.<br/><br/>Setting up Angie's "new" Chromebook (my old one), took a little bit longer. The Powerwash feature is awesome. A few clicks (and a few warnings to backup your local files), and the old becomes new again...restored to factory settings. Most of the extra time was spent just walking through and adjusting settings to make them identical to mine. It's not that mine are "best", it's just that whatever behavior she sees that she doesn't understand is easier to troubleshoot when I know her configuration.<br/><br/>By the time we left her home last night, Angie was all smiles. I actually think she wanted us to go home so she could play with her new toy.
This is a delightful piece of hardware. I spent a lot of time going back and forth over my Chromebook options. As a 'birthday' gift I wanted to have the best affordable entry Chromebook for at home browsing and writing. And with the right tweeks this device turned out wonderful. The best elements so far include:<br/><br/>* Excellent and responsive chicklet keyboard. It's got a nice soft bounce to it. Doesn't hurt my fingers and feels natural unlike many bluetooth keyboards out there. I think the Samsung CB's are the only ones close to it in quality. The Acer ones just felt too cheep.<br/><br/>* The nice HD display. When I first got it, it was at a resolution to great for my eyes. I'm good, but damn I can't read fonts that small. XD Videoes,<br/><br/>* Fantastic battery life. Easily 9-10 with moderate use. True, some CB's have better life, but you can prolong the Thoshiba's by monitering what's eating up your juice. Try following the suggestions listed here: http://www.omgchrome.com/how-to-see-which-apps-and-website-use-chromebook-battery/<br/><br/>* Good case. It doesn't feel flimsy. It's not as rugged as the C740 or C720's sure. But honestly what is? As it stands with a cover on this book I feel pretty secure walking around with it. Sure, I don't EVER want to drop it but it does the job right.<br/><br/>* Celeron Processor so no app issues. This was the clincher between this and the Acer series. I didn't feel like messing around with the Nvidia tablet chipsets on this. I wanted apps to just run and be done with it.<br/><br/>I personally got the 4 Gig of Ram version and picked up a PNY 64 Gig SD card to give me a little onboard space to play with. Offline mode is robust, but that's more an issue of Chrome OS than this unit. You'll have to learn the work arounds with apps and things that Chrome OS doesn't support, but otherwise, it's quiet, cool, and light!<br/><br/>With a new generation of Chromebooks dropping with new processors this unit eventually will be overshadowed. But for the right mix of price to function it's a very, VERY, good unit in the current/last gen to pick up.<br/><br/>I can only hope the next Toshiba CB's stay this good...and maybe pack some more on board memory. Oh well.
I've been using this for a few weeks. I replaced an old tablet which had trouble browsing the web. This thing keeps up great. The keyboard is actually pretty good too. The screen is amazing, as I'm sure many other reviews point out. It may be pretty plastic-y but it doesn't feel like it's about to break.<br/><br/>I chose this chromebook mainly because<br/>* fanless<br/>* can install linux through crouton<br/>* intel processor (this helps in linux)<br/>* the screen (1080p, but see below)<br/><br/>Most reviews say the battery is better on other chromebooks, but this one has been working great for me. I don't charge it everyday. I'm not constantly using it, but I would think under usual circumstances (some youtube videos, a few online documents, web browsing) I would get about 8 hours of use. I haven't measured it though.<br/><br/>This model doesn't have the most powerful processor in the world, and with a dozen tabs or more it might lag, but with 4~5 open it runs just fine for me. I usually have a few tabs open playing music, a few tabs open looking up documentation, and linux running so I can code or try out applications. With all that it does very well, I don't notice much lag at all.<br/><br/>It would be perfect maybe if it was a bit more powerful, had a backlit keyboard, and a touchscreen. But for what it cost, I'm ok without those.<br/><br/>Chromebooks seem to be good at a few things. Some have great battery, some have a nice screen, some have a touchscreen, some have a great processor, some have a touchscreen, etc. But they usually have about 2 or 3 of these at most. So if you're thinking about one, I would just think about what components matter the most to you.<br/><br/>Lastly, I would add something about the screen. It is really good, way better than some of the older chromebooks I've seen and tried. But the 1080p is very fine for the screen size. I'm still working on figuring out how to zoom in on the chromeos UI (zooming in on webpages is very easy). For example the clock in the corner is kind of small. As this is software related and not really a con for the actual product (and also very trivial), I wouldn't take a star off.
I bought this Chromebook after I got fed up with my four year old MacBook Pro. I use it at home and for work. For work, I need basic document editing/viewing capabilities, along with e-mail, and web browsing. After a month of using this computer every day, here are my thoughts on the machine and my first Chromebook experience:<br/><br/>First, here's why I ditched the Mac:<br/>-struggled with demanding websites/videos and multi-tab browsing<br/>-froze/crashed frequently<br/>-expensive repairs<br/>-noisy, hot fan<br/>-big and heavy<br/><br/>So far the Chromebook has pretty much crushed the Mac in these departments. It is way lighter, can handle videos and lots of tabs, doesn't get hot or make noise, and hasn't required any repairs (so far!). Other things I really like about this Chromebook:<br/><br/>-the screen is beautiful<br/>-the battery life is outstanding, and it charges very quickly<br/>-Google gave me a terabyte of storage in Drive for free for two years!<br/>-three-finger swiping from tab to tab is a great little feature on Chrome<br/>-High Contrast Mode is great at night or in the dark (though there should be a shortcut for it)<br/><br/>All these things are great, but there are a few things that made my transition a little less than perfect:<br/><br/>-I had read about a Dropbox "App" for Chromebook, so I felt pretty good about being able to use Dropbox (which I need for work). The "app" is really just a link to dropbox.com, which makes accessing these files a little harder than it was on my Mac. I have found work-arounds, but it definitely requires planning ahead if I'm going to be without internet access.<br/>-Skype only kinda sorta works. There is no Skype app for Chromebook, but there are back-channels for getting a Skype-esque app. It works ok, but my audio/video quality is inconsistent.<br/>-In general, the microphone is just ok. I don't do that much video-chatting, but my friends have definitely complained about my worse audio quality. What's worse, there's no way to adjust the microphone volume.<br/>-This brings me to my biggest issue in general with the Chromebook. I've been a faithful Android user for a while, and I love how easy it is to adjust and customize just about everything. I rather naively assumed the Chromebooks would be just as flexible, but they simply are not designed to be customized at all. Other than mic volume, here are a couple similar issues I've had:<br/>-It can't "rank" WIFI connections. So if I'm within range of two networks that I've saved, my Chromebook seems to just pick one. I wish I could prioritize or rank them, like you can on a PC or Mac.<br/>-there is no "open with" function when I'm managing files. So if I have a PDF or JPEG, but want to open it with an editor app, I cannot just say "open with" Notable PDF, for example.<br/><br/>These are all pretty minor gripes. In general, the transition has been pretty easy, and I've found substitutes/work-arounds for just about everything I used on my Mac. I wish I could give this product 4.5 stars, because I "like it a lot" but don't "love it" yet.
I mulled over which Chromebook to buy (if any) for months.  After much research, this one emerged as a favorite among critics, and it has proven to be a marvelous machine.  If you are on the fence, let me encourage you to go for it.  This device is fast, and handles upwards of a dozen tabs or more open at once with no noticeable lag.  The display is absolutely gorgeous, far outshining my wife's iPad.  The sound this little laptop produces is surprisingly rich and full.<br/><br/>There are a few issues: I do get up to 8 hours of battery life at times, but this can vary.  For basic tasks like email and general web surfing, battery life is more than sufficient.  For a lot of video use with the brightness cranked up, you might only get five hours.  Turning down the brightness usually buys be at least another hour of battery life.<br/><br/>The high resolution definitely takes some getting used to.  Websites are no problem, as you can easily resize items in the browser, but system icons and local programs (like Evernote) I have found very difficult to work with given the small font.  In fact, I almost regretted the purchase after the first few hours of use.  But it didn't take long before this machine's pros greatly outweighed this minor issue.  You can, of course, adjust the resolution if it bothers you much, but I have gotten used to the smaller font.<br/><br/>The "limited" software, or at least being limited to the Google ecosystem, also takes a bit of an adjustment.  But I use the machine in tandem with my larger desktop and have had little trouble, especially given the convenience of Drive and Word Online.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading...again, the Toshiba Chromebook 2 with IPS display and true HD is highly recommended!
I didn't buy mine from Amazon but from another etailer.  This is due to Amazon's restrictions of shipping certain products outside of the continental US.  I have been using mine for a few months now and decided to write this review right on one.<br/>I want to mention I also own the first Toshiba Chromebook and this make a good comparison to it.<br/>The main selling point of this Chromebook is Dat Wonderful HD screen in glorious IPS.  This looks better than many much more expensive notebooks, so you can imagine the stark contrast of screens on so many inexpensive notebooks, including other Chromebooks, of this price range.<br/>Construction of the notebook is better than the previous, doesn't have the flexy lid of its predecessor.  Both have this slivery look, as if Chromebook for Toshiba  means literally looking like one.  The silvery plastic on the new one though, feels harder than the previous, and has a griddy pattern that while it doesn't look that good, provides a decent grip while holding the notebook.  This can save you from slipping the notebook out of your hands and crashing into the ground, and I think that is particularly good for the school environment as well.<br/>Despite being plastic, the silver sleek look of the Toshiba Chromebook 2 suggests something far more expensive.<br/>Battery life is average for a Chromebook i have experienced, despite the Bay Trail processor.  I don't think its as good as lets say the Acer C720 or Dell Chromebook 2 at least from my impressions, and I think it has something to do with powering that screen.  I guess this is one of the drawbacks for a better display.<br/>I am surprised how light this device is for a 13.3" notebook.  Its smaller and lighter than the previous Toshiba Chromebook, also a 13.3", and it does it by a more minimal bezel and body design that also gives it a sleeker appearance.  Its not really that much bigger or heavier than the 11.6" Chromebooks like the Acer C720 or Dell Chromebook 11, it feels just as easy to grab and put into a bag.  Its a big improvement on mobility compared to lets say, the excellent Haswell powered HP Chromebook 14.<br/>Performance wise, its fast enough, I don't feel it being slow.  But it doesn't have the snap of the Haswell powered ones like its immediate predecessor.  That is one thing the first generation Toshiba Chromebook has over this model.  Nonetheless, it has 4 Gb of RAM so it can handle more web pages than its 2Gb only predecessor.<br/>I have seen some reviewers pan that the screen look might be a bit small, icons and fonts, when the ChromeOS interface is cast on a 1920x1080p screen.  Personally I have no problems with it.<br/>The sound is amazing.  I think most Chromebooks seem to have good sound, this one a bit better than the others.  Combined with the screen, I love using this Chromebook for watching movies and videos.<br/>Keyboard and trackpad feels like they are the same parts from the previous Toshiba Chromebook but improved.  There is a bit more snap on the keys, and its easy to touch type on.  The trackpad feels a bit more precise this time.<br/>I suspect Google must have a Chromebook czar to set standards because all the Chromebooks I have seen feature better than average cheap notebook construction, great keyboards, responsive precise trackpads, and great sound.<br/>In my opinion, while the Chromebook market has become quite competitive, the Toshiba Chromebook 2 is outright the best Chromebook in the market when it was launched.  I think Toshiba looked at what Chromebook users wanted and came up answering their wishes, instead of just looking to introduce another entry level device with ChromeOS.
Great Product - Gorgeous Display - Very Good Sound - Great Battery - Good Performance<br/><br/>The display is unparalleled among Chromebooks.  If you go to a Best Buy and see this one on display next to other Chromebooks, it's almost a joke how much better this one looks - for not too much more in price.<br/><br/>The Sound is also very good.  The speakers are built into the keyboard, which at first I thought was strange, but now, makes perfect sense, and actually results in a good quality, very loud sound.  It's not top of the line or anything, but it's very good.  "tuned by Skullcandy" - which generally makes good sounding products.<br/><br/>The Battery lasts for hours and hours, even with a full, bright display, and sound playing, and the battery charges very quickly.<br/><br/>The performance is very good.  It's about all you need for most tasks.  There is a very slight glitchyness if you have a few dozen tabs open at the same time and are trying to do some memory intensive task (like streaming 1080p video).  But if you tried to do the same thing on a PC or Mac, the whole thing would probably freeze/crash.  On the chromebook, just close a few tabs, and it will speed right back up.<br/><br/>The Bluetooth is very helpful.  I like being able to stream to a top of the line sound system straight from my laptop.<br/><br/>The ac Wifi is more than fast enough for now (my ISP is my limiting factor), but It's good to know that it is at least somewhat futureproof when it comes to wifi.<br/><br/>Overall a great product and for the price, I am very happy with it.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Toshiba, a few suggestions:<br/><br/>A little cut-out on the front for your thumb when opening the laptop would be very helpful (like on a macbook, or the Pixel).  It's a little annoying opening the laptop without one.<br/><br/>The edge on the front is a little sharp.  It would be more comfortable if that was rounded off.  Since it looks like there is not a seam there, doing so shouldn't be a problem.<br/><br/>Lastly, (this may be a chrome issue and not a Toshiba issue, but...) when pressing the full-screen/immersive button, there is still a little bit of tabs or something showing along the very edge of the screen, that should not be there.
This is my second Chromebook. My first is an Acer C-710 which I love still. I had been watching this Toshiba Chromebook for a few weeks. Last week, Best Buy dropped their price to $249.00 for about 24 hours, so I ordered it online and picked it up at the store within the hour. Sorry, Amazon. I know they would have done a price match, but I wanted this thing ASAP.  I love the whole Chromebook premise. Fast, easy to use, simple to learn, etc. I knew what the limitations of a Chromebook were before I even bought my first one. Obviously, many people DO NOT do adequate research beforehand and then are mad at the Chromebook. For these low prices, these Chromebooks do exactly what I need them to do. This Toshiba has a display that is beyond words. I have streamed a few shows and a action movie on it and it played them flawlessly. Emails, Facebook, Twitter, videos, music are all these machine are for. By the way, the Skullcandy speakers on here are surprisingly good. I have actually been listening to music WITHOUT headphones, which is a first when it comes to laptop.<br/><br/>I think most people are just so "brainwashed" with the whole Windows ecosystem, they find it hard to break away. Not this kid. I am trying to put as much distance between me and Windows as possible. If your looking for a fast, portable, reliable, easy to use laptop for simple, every day computer needs, definitely give a look at this Toshiba.<br/><br/>EDIT: Forgot to mention the battery life. The first time I charged it up and just did strictly web surfing, I went about 9 hours. With streaming, and some games being played it will go 7+. Battery is great. Solid State drive is awesome. No clicking, no heat, no fan. Enjoy!!!!!
I've had the full HD version for a week or two and I can honestly say that it has surpassed my already high expectations. In one word, it's fantastic. I'm used to macbook pros and I already like this more. It boots up instantaneously, it's surprisingly fast, there is no clutter or things I don't want, it's so deliciously light, and the screen, well the screen is amazing. I know this is minor but I really love the wallpapers from Yosemite, but Crome's wallpapers, on this screen, blow them away. I know you wouldn't buy anything for the wallpapers but from the moment I opened it I was in love. Honestly I use computers mostly for internet so this is perfect for me, I can surf reddit, watch youtube videos and shop amazon, what more do you really need. I haven't tried any video or picture editing apps or anything like that, that's not why I bought it. My greatest concern was life without word, and so far google docs, etc, works fine. I'm not entirely used to them and there are still things I'll need to learn, but I'm fine with leaving office. And if you want too, you can download a word app, but I like google docs. I was worried about uploading documents online from google docs, such as resumes, and at first I was only able upload them as google docs, but don't worry, you can download your document in a couple different formats, such as docx and pdf. The docx messed the format up a little but the pdf version was perfect. So, I easily uploaded my resume as a pdf from google docs. Honestly it's hard to believe this laptop is around 300 dollars, you could easily fool people into thinking it cost more, much more. Highly recommend this product. I will update if things change.
Lots of pros for this machine.  All them would apply to any Chromebook.  If you don't know what a Chromebook is you should investigate it online before buying this or any similar laptop.  This is a very well made machine.  One thing that sets it apart from other Chromebooks is the full size SD memory card slot.  Most others have Micro-SD slots.<br/><br/>Removed a star for these issues:<br/>- Glossy screen can make it difficult to see screen in bright situations.  Increasing the screens brightness can overcome this issue but it decreases battery life.  But that smooth screen really makes the colors and details pop out of the screen in a dim room.<br/>- The front edge of the case is kind of sharp.  Depending on where you place your hands while typing this could be a problem.  After using the machine in a position where my palms rested on this edge it became a little uncomfortable.<br/>- The screen resolution is way to high for a 13 inch screen.  At 1920x1080 (Best) resolution webpages/text/icons are very small.  Luckily when you step the rez down to 1536x864 the screen is much easier to read.  Unlike other Chromebooks this decreased resolution looks very good on-screen, no artifacts or other distoritions.  If you have great eyes you may be able to use the high resolution setting.  I can't.<br/>- It might be difficult for some to open the lid of this laptop.  It fits together so well you might need to slip a fingernail into the gap between the top and bottom to get it open.
I previously had an HP Chromebook and LOVED IT. When it died (rest in peace, dear Chromebook), there was no question that I'd get another one. Sadly, I needed it urgently, so since HP Chromebooks were out of stock at the time, I went with this Toshiba. Worst. Mistake. Ever.<br/><br/>It has not worked right even straight out of the box. I kept thinking I'd get used to it, but every week, something new seems to go wrong. First, I haven't been able to get it to "read" anything externally -- not my camera, not my phone, nothing. The ports just don't work. The SD slot -- well, that works. But the SD card doesn't actually stay in. It pops out, so in order to get anything to download from the card, I have to hold it in with my finger. The mousepad doesn't work, sometimes the laptop crashes for no discernable reason and half the time, I'm unable to get certain letters to type.<br/><br/>So yeah, this might be among the biggest wastes of money for me ever. Literally ever. As soon as I can, I'm going to go back to an HP, but I'm still supremely unsatisfied with this thing and regret the purchase.<br/><br/>A positve: It's a Chromebook, so at least my stuff will easily transfer. (But Google needs to take its name off of this thing. It's a big ugly mark on its name. In my opinion.)
The plastic is very thin and cheap feeling.  The left corner doesn't fit quite right and has creaked from day one, not very confidence inspiring.  I think they might have tried to make it just a little to lightweight.<br/><br/>Yesterday while opening it (had this 2 months now) the screen broke.  Was lifting the screen from the right corner and apparently something broke inside as the upper part of the screen went dark.  If you have one of these I recommend lifting the screen from the CENTER so it doesn't twist and flex so much.<br/><br/>Called Toshiba customer support and after getting through the menu system was shocked to be talking to a real person within a minute!  The lady was very nice and very apologetic after telling me that it wouldn't be warrantied.  I must have accidentally misused the screen? my old arthritic hands must be stronger than I thought?<br/><br/>I was tempted to give this one star, but I was happy with everything but the build quality.  If you have one, be gentle with it!
After two weeks of daily use I have to say I am very happy with the Toshiba CB35-B3340. The hd screen is the nicest that I have ever used in a sub $800.00 laptop. Most of my using is limited to Web browsing, hd streaming videos and occasional simple word processing duties. For my use this is a perfect machine, I like the stability of the chrome os and overall performance of machine. The only reason I docked a star on the ratings is the build quality seems to be of lower quality than Lenovo or acer chromebooks. The lid is very flexible and may be a weak point in its construction. The keyboard and controls seem to be of high quality. I have seen multiple reviews complaining about the track pad.  In my two weeks use I have no complaints and prefer it to the many different laptop computers I have used over the years. The fanless construction seems to function well. The bottoms warms up a little but has never been an area of concern. I have downloaded very large graphic files and pdf's while listening to Internet radio with 5-6 tabs open with occasional minor lagging but nothing objectionable. The cpu and memory configuration fully meet my needs. Battery life runs 6 hours of intensive use watching videos and 7+ with mixed videos and browsing.
This is a beautiful computer, my second chromebook.  I originally had an HP 14 that I gave to my daughter when she needed a computer.  Chromebooks are awesome for non-tech people like me, for just browsing the internet or viewing and streaming web content; you never need to worry about viruses attaching or bloatware pre-installed on your computer.  Just be aware that I went thru 3 chromebooks before getting a perfect one; the first one worked fine, but they sent a refurbished computer when I paid for a new one.  The second one came with a huge scratch across the top (looking very much like the one another reviewer posted).  The third one had a large light bleed in the upper left corner,  I finally bought the fourth one from somewhere local, so I could return it if necessary.  Why did I keep trying? It"s perfect!  The screen is bright and crisp, pages load quickly even tho I was worried about the processor, and the size and weight make this computer very portable.  My only complaint is the size of the print; with the higher resolution of this computer, I have to constantly zoom 125% - I haven't figured out how to permanently increase font size, but I'm over fifty, I ALWAYS need larger print :)
In July, we got two new Toshiba Chromebooks. Two months later the hard drive of one died. Toshiba required we ship it to them in their shipping box or they would not accept responsibility for it, even though we still had all the original shipping packaging.  This box cost $29.  After it shipped, they sent a confirmation number and the information numbers to check on progress.  The numbers never worked and the site said that the serial number of the machine didn't exist and it was not recognized by their repair status system.  In the third week after the initial call, it showed up at the door. No notice, nothing, just the machine in a box left at the door. The sheet inside said it was "Repaired." No detail as to what they did.  It seems to work, but I am out $29 to send it to them. 10% of the purchase price to fix a machine that broke down in the first 60 days.  I like the machine, but Toshiba customer service is as bad as ever.  I have purchased a lot of computers for myself and our college age kids including some powerful MSI machines. Our service experience of most companies, HP, MSI, etc., has been good but this was not.  This is my 1st and last Toshiba.
I've had this Chromebook for a month now and I absolutely love it. I had previously owned the smaller Samsung CB but my dog shattered the screen so I had been on the hunt for a new CB. I am currently a student working on my bachelors degree and taking many chemistry and biology classes so I needed a computer that could handle multiple tabs as most of the homework and information is online. I also needed something light so I can take it to classes everyday. This fits my needs perfectly, the screen is large (and gorgeous) enough to see from a desk and I can enlarge the print so small font is not an issue. It fits in my book bag and is the lightest item in there! The battery has been lasting 9 hours on average which is amazing as I was using my sisters tiny laptop and it only lasted 3 hours so the difference is amazing! I have the ability to put in my sd card and download all my pics from my camera and everything is on the drive plus with the purchase of this CB I received 100gb free storage! I see students Facebook and doing homework on pricey macbooks which is crazy this CB is so affordable and does most everything! Love it.
I am impressed!!  Wow, just wow.  Let me give you a little info about myself.  26 years old, tech savy, built my last 4 gaming desktops, have a custom htpc, worked as a technician for years fixing electronics.  Always ran hacked modified versions of software and games, ran bots and scripts.  Have a background in coding.  So on paper you would think this is the last machine i would need in my house.  Truth is, the browser has become the most versatile app to use for just about everyone.  Now I did have realistic expectations for this device and there are def things this machine is not meant to do but what is meant to do it does damn near flawlessly.  The screen is beautiful, hd netflix looks great and ran flawless.  Audio sounds amazing, the speakers are under the keyboard and put to shame most laptop speakers even those on highend laptops.  Keyboard is good enough, i still prefer my mechanical keyboard on the desktop.  Remote desktop runs fantastic.  Battery life is very good.  Touch pad compares to higher end laptops.  I got my refurbished and it appears brand new, not a single mark or blemish on it.  Couldn't be happier.
Had to return it to the third party seller after a few days because the screen had a hairline running vertically across the screen. So the second time around I purchased it at Best Buy. But as far as the product goes it's by far the smartest move I ever made, getting away from any IOS. As a matter of fact it's the only computer I use at home or on the road. I never have to worry about malware or viruses again. It's fast like an iPad because of the solid state hard drive in other words no mechanical moving parts but with a large screen and built in keyboard. Between Microsoft Idrive, Google Drive and Drop Box I have all the iCloud memeory I need.
I bought mine from Best Buy (sorry Amazon... open box deal), but I thought I'd share a review here as well.<br/><br/>We've owned this model for about 3 weeks, and it is awesome. Video playback is great, I LOVE the fact that it has a full HDMI port (instead of a dorky mini-port). The external keyboard and mouse that we've used have worked flawlessly, also the USB drive.<br/><br/>The one thing that is slightly annoying is that it almost looks the same from both ends, so sometimes I need to try a couple times before I can open it up.<br/><br/>Battery life is superb, and the display is beautiful. I have bad eyesight so I have it set to a lower resolution anyway, but when we put movies on our 1080p TV the playback is perfect.<br/><br/>At one point I had 6-7 Google accounts logged in, and we started noticing the chromebook couldn't keep up anymore, so I just removed the accounts we didn't really need (we still have 3 users on it), and it works great. It's waaay better than the Samsung chromebook we also have (just use that for cooking/baking in the kitchen now).
My first Chromebook after a lifetime of Macs at home, WIndows for work. I use it as a throw-in-the-bag machine and after a couple weeks am wondering I'd ever need more than this for 99% of things and definitely see no need for a Tablet (phones are fine for those types of uses and the screens are big enough now.) The display on this Toshiba is one of the best I've seen on any computer. Yes, at finest resolution the interface is too tiny for older eyes, but settings are easy to access so I use 1536 x 864 for everything except video. In this mode the text is still razor sharp and the interface elements are just right for the bright, evenly lit 13" screen. Still compact, but perfectly readable. Really impressive. And quiet and light too. The build quality and feel is also very good. Much more plasticky than a Macbook for sure, but as good as most Windows laptops. I have a "cheap" $700 Samsung Windows laptop and this thing blows it away in terms of build quality, and the screen is no comparison, the Toshiba's fine grain IPS is up there with the Macbooks.
I have been using it for about a month now and I really like a lot of things about this device. The screen is fantastic--crushes every other Chromebook I looked at it. Performance has been spot on for my needs (writing, browsing, social, a bit of streaming video and the occasional web conference via G+). WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity has been reliable. Touchpad is not great, but it gets the job done. The overall build quality is fine--it's no tank, but its about what I expect at the price. There's the tiniest bit of wobble when you set it on the table, but not so bad that I find it distracting. The big (HUGE) disappointment for me is the keyboard. Given how central a feature this is to a non-touchscreen device, it is a major oversight. I'm not even talking about the lack of "extravagances" like backlighting. I do a lot of writing and this thing feels awful and cheap. If anything comes to market with a comparable screen, performance and price (or even a bit more) and a nice keyboard, I'll hand this off to the kids or put it up for sale.
Let's start with the performance, since that is what everyone is talking about.  While typing this review I'm streaming a 1080p movie in side by side browsers.  Also, I have google inbox and google calendar as background tabs.  There is no stuttering of any kind in the video.  If I open a new tab, the audio plays but the video stops for approx 3-5 seconds as the new tab loads.  The audio volume is fantastic, it can actually get too loud at points. This isn't as fast as a500-1000$ computer.  For $350 inc tax this is a great buy.<br/><br/>I'm upgrading from the original samsung chromebook.  Compared to that, this is an amazing device.<br/><br/>Cons: I'm not a fan of the textured mouse pad but it isn't distracting.  You do have to push the keys more firmly to have them input. Screen could definitely tilt further back, fine when its on your lap/table, but if you're sitting on the floor its not enough.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm very happy with the purchase.  I don't think I can double up on the 100gb google drive offer.<br/><br/>Chromebooks in 2015 will be perfect.
Edit: If you are having stuttering issues with 1080p 60fps Youtube videos https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/h264ify/aleakchihdccplidncghkekgioiakgal?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog<br/><br/>I purchased and returned 2 non IPS Chromebooks over the past 2 years. The reason? The screens were washed out and had bad viewing angles. My main laptop is a late 2009 macbook and I like that screen so I was looking at buying a Macbook air for over $700 so I could have a good screen. That was until I heard of an IPS Chromebook which wasn't until this week. As soon as I heard they had one and read the reviews I purchased one.<br/><br/>Screen is gorgeous, especially for under $300!<br/><br/>Battery life is long and it charges quickly.<br/><br/>Videos look fantastic in 1080p!<br/><br/>Only negative is that sometimes web pages can get a bit jerky when loading with multiple tabs open but they smooth out quickly.<br/><br/>For those complaining about font that is too small, you can either click CTRL +/- to adjust font sizes or CTRL and Shift and +/- to change the screen's resolution.
Bought one at Best Buy the other day because I'm impatient and didn't want to wait on shipping. I've been using it for typical college student stuff (notes, youtube, streaming music, etc.) and /light/ programming work.  Meaning I've used it to write some short programs (I stress the word short) for some of my courses, and it's held up beautifully.  My old laptop was a gaming behemoth that weighed upwards of 10 pounds, so coming from that, this baby is nearly weightless.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Snappy<br/>1080p<br/>Boots nearly instantly<br/>Did I say snappy?<br/>Light<br/>Extremely easy to install linux on<br/>SD card is completely hidden when inserted into laptop<br/>Doesn't feel plasticky and weak despite the weight<br/>Long battery life<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Can get kinda tiresome to type on after an extended period of time<br/>Not a huge selection of applications on the Chrome OS, but that is neither a fault of the laptop nor is it a deal breaker.
This is my first Chromebook and I am sold. I explored for months all the top branded machines and finally settled on the Toshiba because of the superior display, the Intel processor and general overall build. I installed a fast 64 GB SD card in the side slot and bought a 128 GB USB 3.0 fast flash thumb drive for quick local file transfer/access and this thing zings along beautifully. Additionally, the free 100 GB of space on Google Drive is a definite plus for cloud storage of media and documents which I can now access from anywhere I travel.<br/>I had trouble getting Google Drive to release the 100 GB space because the system kept telling me the machine wasn't eligible. Google customer service were very prompt in helping me resolve the issue by guiding me through steps to get the machine recognised. If you have the same problem with your new unit just do a "powerwash" in advanced settings and then go get your 100 GB space on Google Drive.
I have never loved an IT product more than this one.  I have been an IT professional since before there were PC's and I just can't imagine anyone not being head-over-heels in love with this fantastic little machine.  I've owned it now for nearly a year and I can say it's never far from my side.  We are so easily swayed by friends and advertising that we NEED the latest, greatest laptop configuration, when all 85% of us need for nearly all our computing needs is this!<br/><br/>I use my desktop PC now only for playing the occasional video game (mostly I play on consoles).  I would never use my PC for any kind of secure transactions as they're just not safe.  I have come to rely so much on on this Chromebook, I just can't imagine being without it.  If something happened to it, I would buy this exact model and configuration without hesitation.<br/><br/>Nice job, Toshiba.
This Chromebook is really among the best out there as Chromebooks go but I ended up returning it. My major problem was that it just could not handle 1080p streaming content without stuttering and dropping frames. I've had the Chromebook for 3 weeks and have thoroughly tested it and found that it just is not powerful enough to display 1080p video on the beautiful 1080p screen. That was important to me and so I returned it.<br/><br/>Otherwise, this is really a great Chromebook and I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. The keyboard feels great. It's big enough and doesn't feel cramped. It's not noisy and overly clicky. The speakers sound pretty good and are hidden within the keyboard somehow, so you don't actually see speaker grills, but the sound is good and loud.<br/><br/>I had no problems with having many tabs open (7-10) and not really experiencing any slowdown. The screen is bright and excellent and probably the best screen you can get on a Chromebook now that isn't the expensive Google Pixle Chromebook. I did not like how the screen does not dim enough...still too bright at the lowest dim setting in my opinion.<br/><br/>I really looked hard for a Chromebook with a 1080p screen that could handle 1080p video streaming without stuttering or dropping frames, but could not find one in the $350 range I was looking for. That's pretty sad. The 720 p screens that are common on Chromebooks really look quite awful. Some worse than others. The Toshiba is a standout, but it's sad that the hardware just isn't powerful enough to handle 1080p video reliably.<br/><br/>My internet connection is effective 30mbs download solid. Plenty for streaming 1080p to work flawlessly.<br/><br/>I ended up going with a Lenovo Yoga 2 10" Windows 8.1 Tablet w/ Keyboard that was in my price range. It handled 1080p and even 2K video beautifully in an in store test that had crappy WiFi. Also an above 1080p resolution screen, albeit small at 10". Sad to have to leave chromebooks for now, but until hardware gets better, currently a Chromebook is just not for me.
I received this Chromebook as a gift recently, and I am in love.  Initially, I had looked into possibly getting a MacBook Air or MacBook Pro because those seem like the computers to have these days.  Even my mom has a MacBook Air, and I was sick of lugging around my heavy, five year old laptop from place to place that needed to be charged every two hours.  Unfortunately, I was in no way willing to spend nearly $1,000 or more on a computer.  I am a student, and I mostly use my computer for a good deal of internet based activities as well as writing.  As nice as MacBooks are, I knew that there was no sense in me paying for one when I wouldn't be able to utilize its fullest potential.  At this point during my search for a new computer, I was kind of stumped.  I had dabbled with Windows 8 and had come to terms with the fact that I simply didn't like it.  I had considered looking into purchasing an older, used MacBook, but the struggle just didn't seem worth it.  It was then that I learned about Chromebooks.  I did my researched, and considered purchasing the HP Chromebook; however, things seemed to work themselves out and I ended up receiving this Chromebook as a gift.  I am very very pleased.  It's light, sleek, easy to use, and stylish.  It's actually quite reminiscent of a MacBook in certain areas.  It's all of the simplistic style I wanted but in a much more reasonable form.  It's perfect for every day web browsing.  The colors are bright and vibrant for the price point, and the screen's brightness ranges from a very easy-on-the-eyes dimmer setting to a very bright setting that is clearly visible even in direct sunlight.  Very rarely, however, do I have to turn the brightness all the way up.  I usually keep the screen at no more than 50% because anything more than that is almost too bright.  There is no glare, which I can greatly appreciate.  The keyboard layout is pretty simple, and the keys have a nice feel to them.  I feel comfortable typing for extended periods of time.  The track pad is nice and smooth and large; it functions, again, similarly to a MacBook mouse pad.  The laptop is quiet (there are no noisy fans and it stays cool to the touch).  The battery life is OUTSTANDING, especially when compared to my previous laptop.  I can go all day on a single charge with nearly constant use; I'm looking forward to being able to take this laptop to classes with me without having to worry about it dying or needed to lug around a charger in my bag.  Overall, I think this computer would be really great for users, like myself, who don't need much else out of a computer other than web browsing, the occasional paper/project, and/or music.
I love how this chromebook feels similar to a macbook air. Let me start by saying that I am a mac user with a Late 2012 iMac with IPS, Macbook Pro and an iPad Air. So I am going to do my review with these devices in mind. This chromebook is fantastic. It is so simple to use and very light. I can hold it on the corner with one hand without it feeling like its about to bend. It feels smaller than how it looks from pictures which is a good thing.<br/><br/>The display is gorgeous. It reproduces similar colors as my iMac but has warmer whites. I mainly use it about 70% brightness but full brightness looks amazing. IPS is just as amazing as on the iMac. I changed its resolution to 1536x864 because its full res is too small. Like tabs, bookmarks are too small to read.<br/><br/>I have not had any major performance issues with this. Sure there is a small lag but it doesn't bother me. It is still usable. 1080p youtube videos stutter here and there but 720p gets the job done. The only website I noticed that suffers is facebook. Especially when it loads the feed while I scroll.<br/><br/>Like I said earlier, its appearance is like a macbook air. Its keyboard is really nice. Although it feels like a half pressed key compared to a mac, it doesn't bother me and it is a new experience. Its trackpad is great. Very responsive. It's texture is nice. It's lid cover is superb. I was expecting braille like bumps but it is actually smooth.<br/><br/>The speakers are great. especially coming from a laptop. It doesn't sound muffled and it is loud. Battery, I get about 6-8 hours depending on usage.<br/><br/>Overall, I love this chromebook. This is my first one so I can't really compare it to other chromebooks but all i can say is that I love using it. I bought it on amazon for 299 so the price is perfect. It does what I need it to do. If you are deciding which chromebook to get, definitely get a Toshiba Chromebook 2. It is a well rounded computer. You don't need an i3 if you have other power computers. I can't wait to see future chromebooks.
I actually bought this straight from toshiba.com, but I just wanted to write a review for it. I honestly love this chromebook! I've tested the acer's, samsung, and hp in store at best buy or fry's, but there was always something I really didn't like about each of them. (For example, acer's performance for the C720/P chromebooks are great performance wise, but the frame itself is SO flimsy and the screen wobbles at the hinge like crazy).  I bought this as a secondary laptop for college while my primary laptop is the sony t series ultrabook (was in the $1000 range). Secondary only because as a college student, the inability to use excel or a good pdf editor is pretty inconvenient.<br/><br/>The IPS UHD screen is absolutely gorgeous and worth the extra money! The speakers are loud and clear til the highest volume (overpowers my ultrabook speakers), does not heat up, is extremely quiet, keyboard feels good and solid, trackpad is wide, and the battery lasts for a long time! Although, I am not a person to always look at my computer screen at 100% brightness. I keep mine at around 30-50% (unless the room is bright), and the battery lasts me about 10 hours. Also, I get really caught up reading news. Sometimes I open 7-10 tabs without closing the old ones, but I haven't noticed significant lag when I do so. If you do think you need more memory space, the SD card slot doesn't leave the card jutting out, so you can always expand memory using an SD card (which for now, you can even find 64 GB class 10 SDHC cards for $18-20 if you can find the right deal), or use a USB like this so it barely sticks out. USB is just the faster transfer speed option.<br/><br/>http://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Ultra-Low-Profile-Flash-SDCZ43-064G-G46/dp/B00LLEODCK/ref=sr_1_14?s=electronics&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1419289597&sr;=1-14&keywords;=cruzer+sandisk<br/><br/>Cons: The only thing I would really change about this laptop is that there's no part of the laptop design that helps you open it easily. I have longer/stronger nails than my brother or mom do, so it's not a problem for me.
This is my 3rd Chromebook. The first, a Samsung 11.6". The 2nd, Toshiba's 13.3" from last year. And now this model and I must say this is by far the best Chromebook I've ever used. I won't go into a detailed review as Kenneth L. Rodina, M.D. and BKarno have written excellent and thorough reviews of this model. What makes this standout is the screen. It's Apple-like and I've been waiting for a Chromebook to have a good screen. It has brilliant color and resolution with a much wider viewing angle. Also, the sound it much improved with Skullcandy. I enjoy watching Nefliix on this device. The battery lasts 7 hours for me and that's streaming video from youtube with the screen at the second lowest brightness setting and the sound at the halfway mark. Last year's Toshiba had excellent battery life, too, but this model beats it by about 30 minutes. It took roughly 2 hours and 17 minutes to fully charge the battery. As for the screen, even with the brightness at the second lowest setting, it's plenty bright just like my Apple iPad. The power is just fine as I usually only have two tabs opened at the most. It streams Netflix, Amazon and youtube videos without problems. I like that this model is actually smaller and lighter than last year's model but has the same size screen. The keyboard is good as is the touchpad. I prefer to use a mouse and my bluetooth mouse links up just fine. The wireless connection now supports AC but my router is still at "N" so I can't really say how much better AC wireless is.<br/><br/>The only cons are that is still doesn't play Minecraft which my kids love. Skype doesn't work. Hangouts is fine but most of my friends use Skype. Microsoft is working on Skype to work inside the Chrome browser without a plugin but they say it will only be usable for Chrome under a windows computer. Microsoft owns both Minecraft and Skype so hopefully in the future they will make it usable on Chromebooks.<br/><br/>Lastly, I'm a Dish Network subscriber and use their sling media to watch TV on my computer and other devices. They just updated their plugin for the Chrome browser and it's excellent, but it won't work on my Chromebook.<br/><br/>All-in-all, this is, in my opinion, the best Chromebook out there and it's worth the extra $30 bucks for the superior screen and improved sound. In the future, I would like to see a 17.3" model, a touch screen once Chrome is optimized for it, a keyboard that lights up, and a small subwoofer under the hood to go with the good speakers.
As an IT guy, my main machine is a mobile workstation, 9lb behemoth that lasts about 1.5-2 hours at most on its massive battery. Given that most of my life is in the Google Cloud, it is VERY easy for me to switch 80% of my needs over to the Chromebook.<br/><br/>I was one of the original CR-48 recipients form when Google send out those eval units YEARS back when the Chromebook was frst launched as a concept. Up until I got this one, I still used the CR-48 occasionally, for it utter simplicity and light weight.<br/><br/>The Samsung Chromebook 2 is not the fastest machine - I usually have between 20 and 50 tabs open on my desktop at any time (several Google Apps accounts, Docs/Drive, Calendars, etc) - and the Chromebook would not able able to handle that level of multitasking - it seems more than 8 tabs open, or even 1 or 2 if they are very 'heavy' pages - and it definitely becomes a little choppy and you lose responsiveness. But for light use, it is perfect for banging out some emails, modifying configs on my network, etc. It is truly instant-on, and if you utilize all of the Google sync features, you can easily bounce from one machine to another.<br/><br/>The screen is fantastic - a little glossy for my taste, but vibrant, bright, crisp, and great contrast. Ive been holding out on getting a new chromebook because I am spoiled with my main laptop's hi-res 10-bit calibrated display. But between the screen quality itself, as well as the fact that is is FHD resolution, means that it has lots of screen real estate for displaying windows side by side or working on some more involved spreadsheets, etc. NOTE: While I LOVE hi-res screens where everything is small but I can see a lot of info, some users with less-than-ideal eyesight might find the icons and such a little small. Sure, you can zoon in on the web pages, but menus, icons, etc do not change - perhaps a system setting should be introduced to do screen scaling, like you find on full desktop-class OS's, or something more responsive to the DPI, like on mobile. As long as it is a user-configurable setting, not something hard-baked in.<br/><br/>Speaker quality is acceptable, but plenty loud enough.<br/><br/>Batter life, with mixed use and moderate brightness, is around 6.5-7 hours.<br/><br/>Keyboard is decent to type on, though a bit 'squishy'. Touchpad is not the finest quality, but then again this is not a $2k machine.<br/><br/>Overall, for the price, I'm quite happy with the unit. It is a nice complement to my primary systems, very portable, no thinking about backup or maintenance/updates, etc.<br/><br/>I will definitely be recommending this to friends and relatives with basic computer needs and not-so-optimal computer skills. Great value.
This is my 6th Chromebook and I'm a little underwhelmed by it. Coming from an HP 14 the build quality is pretty low. There are gaps between the top and bottom part of the case, there are gaps between the screen and display housing which has caused some light bleeding in the bottom part of the screen. There is also a dead/red pixel on mine. I'm going to return this one and if the next one isn't up to snuff, i'll call it a day. Nice product, bad experience.<br/><br/>update: I returned my first Toshiba Chromebook 2. I used my Windows laptop for awhile, until that thing crapped out on me (Dell XPS 12, display port disconnected from the motherboard). So here I am looking for a cheap replacement laptop for classes next week: in comes the Toshiba Chromebook 2 again. I open it in the store to make sure the display is okay, it's totally fine. No gaps, no light bleed, nothing wrong with it (my first must have been a bad unit). I've been using it for about a week now, taking it to class for notes, shooting stuff to my Chromecast...It's unbelievable. I managed to get nearly 9 hours on a charge with the display at half brightness. NINE HOURS! The keyboard is great for notes, the track pad is nice, speakers are LOUD and have a decent range, the display is unbelievable (honestly, don't think I could find another one this good under $600). I'm just blown away by the performance too. Ive seen some reviews saying it's 'underpowered', but it managed 650 on the fishbowl test and can stream without stuttering to my Chromecast in 720p, my last Chromebook (HP 14) couldn't' even do that. I'm blown away by the fact that this thing was just $330, I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in Chromebooks, it's the Chromebook to beat for sure.
The HD display is gorgeous.  The stereo speakers give excellent, clear sound.  The Toshiba Chromebook is significantly faster and more responsive than my MacBook Pro and a lot simpler to use.  I find myself using the Toshiba Chromebook  in preference to both my MacBook Pro and to my iPad, most especially with the Chromebook comfortably sitting on a pillow perched on my lap as I surf the net in my easy chair.<br/><br/>  The Chromebook store has a free extension made by Amazon called the Kindle Cloud Reader.  I use this to read my Kindle eBooks.  It works great for that purpose, with lots of choices including two column or one column, margin width,  background color (white, sepia, or black), and font size.  I especially like being able to double tap on any word to bring up that word's definition.  I also like being able to place the cursor next to a line, so that if I shift my vision elsewhere I can know where I am on the page when I look back.<br/><br/>  I like the trackpad a lot.  It's very easy to use, especially with the default shortcuts of a one finger light double tap to simulate clicking the left mouse button, a light two finger tap to simulate clicking the right mouse button, and a light two finger up or down swipe to move the browser viewing area up or down.<br/><br/>  I am a big fan using the Google Cloud to keep files accessible on all my devices. For example, I keep PDF's in the Google Cloud of the financial newletters I subscribe to.  (I strongly advise using the Google 2-factor authentication option). Purchasing the Toshiba Chrombook 2 HD entitled me to upgrade for free to a whopping 1 Terabyte of Google cloud storage, good for two years.<br/><br/>  The more I use this Toshiba Chromebook 2 HD the more I like it.
Great screen, light and thin, fast boot-up - just the size I was looking for.  Not too small as to be unusable for day to day work, but not so big as to be to clunky to haul around.  I still have my Windows desktop computer for those few things that I need Windows for, but this Chromebook has really become my most-used computer because it is so easy to take to any room or place that I want.<br/>  I've had a couple other chromebooks (the 11" size screens) and would up returning both of them, because altho they worked well, I just didn't find them to be usable enough.  THIS computer however seems to hit my sweet spot with a gorgeous IPS screen PLUS a size that fits nicely into my lap or sits well on a table with a big enough screen that my (older with reading glasses) eyes can see well.
So happy to get rid of heavy and uncomfortable microsoft environment. This laptop beats my last ASUS win8 (core i5) laptop on every point:<br/><br/>- The full HD screen is fantastic<br/>- The sound is great thanks to skullcandy<br/>- Very fast for starting the computer, opening and switching web pages<br/>- Fanless, meaning no noise<br/>- Excellent keyboard and touchpad<br/>- Very light (2.95 lb)<br/>- 7/8 hours battery life (watching movies)<br/>- The third of the price of a windows laptop with equivalent performances (yet noisy , 4/5 hours battery life , heavy weight )<br/><br/>Yes , this is a chromebook , meaning web use only (plus google drive for word , excel and PowerPoint works) but that is 99 % of my PC usage.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this laptop.
This laptop is even better than i expected. i read up on reviews and the toshiba chromebook 2 was said to be the best one out there. i'm really impressed. it's super light and the simple keyboard looks just like a mac (which i really like). the display is GORGEOUS!! (also just like the macbook pro with retina display). good sound. the speakers aren't anything to rave about but they are nice and loud. that's what counts for me. :) i love that it is completely silent! my previous laptop was a hp dv5 and my goodness when the fan got going (which was almost always) i couldn't hardly hear anything even with the volume all the way up. any way, i love my chromebook! i recommend it to anyone that uses a laptop for just regular everyday internet and netflix and youtube. :)
This is what you need in a computer without slogging through what most people dont want on their computer.I have had alot of laptops,tablets etc..My last was a terrible HP with windows 8 and all those Microsoft boxes scattered on the screen like I dropped a deck of cards and most of them were useless.This has a YouTube icon,Gmail icon,Facebook icon,Chrome icon Pinterst icon all tucked away in the bottom corner nice and neatly and all the most common items used on most pcs.I started up,put in my email and wifi info and off it went updating quickly .I didnt get a mess of HP messages or requests to register for innocuous apps I dont want.My HP was more than twice the cost and much bigger screen size and only 18 months old yet this Chromebook feels so much better
I like it a lot. The HD version I bought has an incredible screen. The fit and finish is really good. I have two very minor dislikes.... 1. the laptop seems to be a bit difficult to open, the shape could have had a little indent or something to assist in opening. I seem to struggle a bit with that. 2. It has a mesh type of feel on the front cover and that keeps the fingerprints off but I would have preferred a smooth finish. All said though I would not hesitate to make this purchase again, it does exactly what I need and my two issues are more personal than anything else.<br/><br/>A little side note: Having owned larger and smaller models I find the size to be perfect, not too big and not too small. It seems to be the sweet spot for me.
Experienced the same display issues that many others did, within DAYS of purchase. No abuse, no mistreatment of the laptop. The inner LCD is fragile and breaks with normal use. The _inside_ LCD is cracked and broken, despite the fact that the _outside_ remains pristine. The outer shell of the computer is too flexible to protect the LCD, meaning that even the gentle pressure required to move the laptop screen open or closed may be enough to damage it. Read the other one-star reviews before making your decision to purchase it. Toshiba got the weight down (and it is tremendously light) by using materials that were insufficient to protect the machine from even very casual and careful use. Since it's been only days, I'm returning via Amazon.
After a month or so of use, I can't really fault it. The battery life has been strong, which is one of the main reasons I purchased it. The screen quality is great though I would normally prefer a matte finish to a glossy one. No issues with the Wifi, the weight is nice and light, the keyboard is nice to use. I was initially skeptical about the touchpad but I've since come to find it's quite usable. I occasionally have issues doing the 'double-finger tab forwards/backwards' on Chrome but that's not a big deal to me. The plastic body isn't entirely attractive but as before and I guess this is the other side of that coin; the weight is nice.<br/><br/>TL;DR, Weight, battery life and screen are awesome. Touchpad is less awesome.
First chromebook.  As many state, screen is lovely (and can even dial up to 2400 x 1350).  I've had no real issue with the (slower) CPU at all, this does what I need it to.  Still getting it setup for how I'll use it - haven't tried the usb-serial connector yet - but it makes it very easy/quick to pick up, do something, and put it down.  For me the downsides are completely manageable... chiclet keyboard, cheap trackpad, sharpish plastic edges on sides, curious plastic-ridged outside shell... that are are really nitpicky items, compared to getting what I feel is about the best chromebook currently available.  Minus 1 star for items mentioned, but really should only be 1/2 subtracted.
The device is beautiful! It has a beautiful screen, feels very light, and I'm impressed by the Intel Bay Trail processor!
So far the Toshiba Chromebook meets expectations.  Beautiful screen and attractive build.  I like the keyboard feel and its responsive enough for practical work.  Connecting to our home printer using Cloud Print was straightforward enough once I found directions.  Why not five stars?  The chassis has a lot of flex compared to the laptops and tablets I've had the most experience with, Apple and Lenovo.  That flex detracts slightly from my impressions.  That said, so far it is a great 'homework tool' for the kids, which is the principle mission for the Chromebook.  I especially like how its directed to doing work, and the integration with 2-factor authentication.
I got this chromebook because I am a student who will soon be heading into the professional world. I already have a high powered desktop and needed something I could use in a classroom, whether teaching or as a student. This is better than I ever could've hoped for, it has almost replaced my at home desktop and is slowly starting to replace my fiance's laptop as well as she now is looking to purchase one in the future. I highly recommend the chrombook platform to anyone, especially if they already have a windows machine. And if you are reading reviews to find which chromebook you may want, this really is the best one right now. Period.
The screen on this Chromebook blew me away. And the battery feels like it lasts forever. I am no longer hunting for an outlet when I have this device out. Keyboard feels roomy too.<br/><br/>Some minor cons:<br/>- The stickers on the inside are a major pain to remove.<br/>- Due the high resolution, the icons in the toolbar are quite small.<br/><br/>A con for advanced users:<br/>- I was not able to boot Linux off a USB stick. Had to fall back on the Crouton scripts, which worked like magic, and if you use Cinnamon as your window manager, only a very small amount of disk space will be consumed.
Wasn't quite sure what to expect. This is my first Chromebook.  USED Excellent, was the proper description. I can't tell it was used, but I saved 10% on the price.  The screen is very high def. I really like it. I think it is the Toshiba Chrome answer to the MAC retina display.<br/>I like the simplified operating system.  It boots fast and has long battery life  10 hrs.  I'm not accustomed to "apps" but I'll get over it.<br/>Using it is similar to my macbook pro. but not quite as capable. There are always compatability problems with some attachements, but as I learn I can get around those with available apps.  When it is running it just gets slightly warm, not almost hot like the macbook, and not a lap burner like the pc laptops.  I like the keyboard entry as my finger excretions are murder on "touch screens". (I detest touch screens)<br/><br/>My wife thinks the standard font size is too small, but I being nearsighted, love it. How better to make use of the great resolution?<br/><br/>I find the "skullcandy" logo offensive.  the name seems satanic to me.  I plan to obliterate this logo.
I have to say - I am a power user. I have been running my web design business now for 4 years. I use a great deal of powerful software and plenty of machines. I have to say - I am heading to less is best. I walked away from Microsoft Products and have been suing Google Apps for Business (work) since their day one. The only drawback for me - I need Photoshop/Illustrator for the graphic part of my business. But I say this. That is all the heavy lifting I do with my other computers.<br/><br/>I run by business exclusively with Google Apps. I picked the best computer to do so!
Web surfing fun! Fast boot up. Quick page access. This is my go to research tool. Good volume and sound. Fantastic HD screen ---WOW!!!!!!<br/>No anti virus software needed. No update downtime. Thin, lightweight and it can rest on your lap or bed or couch. No venting required, no fan.<br/>Screen zoom is so easy--hold CTRL and push + or -  , or 0 to return. You can also set the desired zoom ( I like 125%) by clicking the lower right icon, go to settings, then advanced settings, then web content, and set zoom to your preference.<br/>It can print, but I haven't gotten that far yet. I don't know about word processing or photos, or? I will update later. I have a laptop for the other things such as photo editing, etc. .<br/>I plug it in at night, otherwise it runs on the internal battery. It seems to have a long life on battery (see specs).<br/>You Tube videos are incredible. Also has HDMI output for your 100" big screen. Music videos look and sound very good. Also has audio jack to output to your receiver.<br/>Hope this helps. God Bless !
I spent alot of time reviewing chromebooks, and ended up purchasing this chromebook for a few reasons. It came down to the Acer C720 (with the i3) and this laptop. I was a little apprehensive about the potential performance deficiencies but after using it for a few days, it has only skipped a few times. It does seem to struggle with spotify a little bit. Overall, I'm very happy with this. The battery is as good as it claims to be, and the screen is amazing. Normally I'm not one to be concerned with the screen but this one is very impressive.
Picked one of these up a couple of weeks ago, replaced my IPad that Apple made unusable with ISO 8.x. Thought about getting a 13 inch Macbook Pro, it became an easy choice once I decided what I really wanted to do with a portable machine and factored in price. I got my Chromebook for $329 from Amazon and am very pleased with it. Great screen, really nice keyboard, it's not heavy and has a good looking case. Chrome appears to have very good memory management, I like it so much I've made it the default browser on my IMac.
I really liked this Chromebook. It is perfect for what I use a laptop for. I may have to downgrade this rating though depending just how well Toshiba stands behind their product. The other day I came home from work, opened up the Chromebook and when the video started the screen was all dark with red, pink and green lines running through it. It never did come on and the screen got very hot in the center at the bottom. I've only had this thing for 3 months and it's never been abused and is still in "like new" condition. Initial calls to Toshiba did not sound promising. After I explained the issue I was having the very first thing out of the representatives mouth was "Well, that probably won't be covered by your warranty!" They stopped short of dashing my hopes completely but I certainly do not have a warm, fuzzy feeling at this point. So right now I am torn between a great little Chromebook that could turn into a bad memory.
This is the second chromebook for me and it is definitely an improvement over the first one.  I don't know what others complain about the screen brightness and sharpness because I think it's great.  I guess some people are just super critical.  If you are not totally dependent on Microsoft to do your tasks then this is the book for you.  Love that the updates and virus protection are taken care of even before they can get to you.  Highly recommended.
I have a number of Apple products, including a 15-inch MacBook Pro Retina that cost me upwards of 3K. Thus, I was looking for something a little cheaper, more portable and basic for surfing the web at coffee shops and the like. This Chromebook is an excellent choice for surfing the web, streaming videos and catching up on email. I'm impressed and happy that I decided to try this ecosystem. I highly recommend this product.
I bought this to see what a Chromebook was all about and if it might have a use in the office as an inexpensive travel alternative. The screen is much better than my Macbook Air. It works flawlessly. I use outlook through web-access (although I had to google a workaround because the software blocks that sight). It is a great machine and a spectacular cheap alternative to a laptop for most uses.
I absolutely love my new Chromebook.  My laptop died on me out of nowhere a few days ago (RIP) and so I decided to replace it with this Chromebook 2 from Toshiba. I'm a huge fan of the screen, quality of build, and 1TB storage option.  Everything I do revolves around the internet and Google, so this is the perfect machine for me. #CANTWAIT for all Android apps to be available for Chrome OS.
I have owned a great many laptops: mostly Apples, the 1st gen. Chromebook, and so on. For the money, and even price aside, this thing is great:<br/><br/>1) The display is remarkably good: as sharp as the Apple Retina, brighter than the Retina, colors saturated but not Technicolor Schmirpy, and with such a remarkably full spectrum from black black to white white that it "pops" right off the screen.<br/><br/>2) The sound from the internal speakers is the best I've heard from a laptop since my 17" MacBook Pro. It won't rattle your windows or liquify asphalt, but it is rich, full, and detailed. I'm not kidding: it's surprisingly good.<br/><br/>3) Some have observed that the case is "plasticky" and that the micro-pebble texture is kinda weird. It is, to be honest, but why would you care about that sort of thing?<br/><br/>4) I love the keyboard. The short throw gives a crisp, precise feel. Good stuff.<br/><br/>5) I like the vaguely textured feel of the touchpad as well. None of that stick-and-slide thing that some pads have, and a nice distinct click when you click. (Apple touch pads are the WORST in this regard).<br/><br/>6) You can get like FOUR of these things for the cost of one Apple. I like Apple laptops a lot, but c'mon!<br/><br/>7) It's light as heck.<br/><br/>8) It's got the ports you need.<br/><br/>9) Chrome has its shortcomings: limited or quirky access to peripherals (Forget that optical drive, Buster.), limited utility for the software offline, a strangeness which never quite abates in the way things work generally. Still it works pretty well, it updates itself and improves all the time, and viruses et al are a total non-issue. Can you dig in way down to the appealingly strange looks-like-DOS level? Nope. Do you have to? Nope.<br/><br/>This thing is REALLY good,and I am very happy with it. A remarkable value.
Unimpressed overall.<br/><br/>In terms of specs and everything, great product. Nice keyboard and trackpad for a chromebook, the screen quality would normally be good, ignoring my issue for a moment which I will mention further below. Overall I would have been happy, but Toshiba seems to have some really bad quality control issues.<br/><br/>My first Chromebook arrived, with 3 stuck pixels, one of which shone red in dark scenes or backgrounds and was blatantly obvious and annoying. I requested a replacement, and the replacement arrived, with only one stuck pixel this time, and really hard to notice. However, the entire bottom seemed to be improperly constructed. It was visibly different from the first Chromebook, and it almost seemed like it was slightly "twisted", if that makes sense?<br/><br/>The trackpad was noticeably misaligned, to the point I could slide my fingernail INSIDE the laptop along the left side of the trackpad. And furthermore, the entire bottom of the laptop wobbled on a flat surface while typing (mainly on the left side again... at first I thought something was under the laptop!!!), and while lifting the laptop up with it closed, the entire bottom made a concerning loud clicking sound, as if something wasn't put together properly. None of these physical defects were present on the first one, with the problematic screen.<br/><br/>If I had a monitor in warranty and had owned it for a while, and a pixel got stuck, I would normally just ignore it. But I'm not willing to accept it on a brand new laptop.<br/><br/>Within minutes of receiving the second one, I phoned Amazon, and they were fantastic. They have already processed a refund, and I will be shipping back both the original one, and the replacement they sent.
I purchased my wife an Acer C720 Chromebook a year ago as she was constantly complaining about our Dell (Windows) laptop that was always out of battery, needed a reboot, or having some virus protection update issue. I gave her the Acer C720 Chromebook and she started using it immediately for web browsing, online shopping, email, facebook, etc. No learning curve needed and to this day she loves her Chromebook.<br/><br/>I have used many Dell (Windows) laptops at work and currently have an Apple MacBook Pro, but wanted a laptop of my own for home use. Most Windows laptop PCs are too big, and the Microsoft Surface and Apple MacBooks too expensive. So I decided to also go the Chromebook route. In April I purchased an Asus C800 13" Chromebook via an Amazon refurbished deal. I started to use it for the same uses as my wife, and in addition did some web design via WebFlow, FTP vis SFTP, and remoted into desktop PC's via Chrome Remote Desktop. It definitely was serving my needs.<br/><br/>The reviews on the Toshiba Chromebook 2 with IPS screen are great on multiple forums, but I thought >$300 was too much to pay. So when a $199 Groupon deal came up in late May, I had to get this Chromebook. My Asus was sold to a friend for what i paid for it, and the Toshiba Chromebook 2 is now in hand. I can say that the full HD display is fantastic and I am very pleased with it. Not only for normal use but its also great when remoting into desktop PC's set-up with large monitors, I can see and use them full screen.<br/><br/>Detractors will say 'Chromebooks need online access' which is not only incorrect (there are a lot of offline apps available) but also not important. Think about when you use your PC, how many times are you NOT connected to the internet?<br/><br/>The Toshiba Chromebook 2 with IPS display is most likely the best Chromebook on the market and can meet the needs of the majority of folks looking for a slim laptop computer with great battery life and a fantastic display.
One of the best purchases I made yet.  For me, since you are going to look at the thing the whole time, the screen should look great and is the foremost priority along with the processing speed.  Decently fast but not the fastest of the Chromebooks (take into account it's in the 300 range).  For most, I believe the speed will more than suffice for the average and the somewhat "heavy" users in terms of the processor and memory.  The trend in Chromebooks so far is that all things considered (processor speed, memory, battery life, screen appearance/resolution) there hasn't been much significant improvement in terms of bang for your buck.  This model, in terms of screens, is definitely a breakthrough.  They are going/are coming out with newer models, but I can say you won't regret this purchase.  Some online reviews still consider it the best Chromebook, when considering all Chromebook factors (price included) to this recent date (May 2015).<br/><br/>Some say that the HD 1080p resolution setting makes it hard to read while browsing being that the screen is 13.3", but the simple solution is to just make the resolution one step lower and it still looks amazing and crystal clear.  If you want an even larger font size but keep the resolution, use the CTRL and + buttons if you want to make fonts/pictures larger on specific websites (specifically ones that have unusually small font, I do this when I read the NY Times).  I only put it on the 1080p resolution when I hook it up to my TV via HDMI cable so I can see movies in that high setting.  And yes, it looks like just like my expensive laptop resolution when connected to the TV.  This made me wonder if this would make the 1080p option unnecessary in terms of non-video, normal use, but I can say even with the lower resolution the crystal clear screen noticeably outweighs the competition in this price range. Thus still definitely worth it in my opinion.
Great laptop amazing for the price but there are some things I was expecting of it that I don't think it quite achieves.<br/><br/>First of all, the screen is amazing, there is not denying that. But I feel that only translates into browsing and viewing pictures. I was hoping to see videos all day on this computer and while it does look good I don't feel it excels as much as with pictures. I feel the computer GPU cannot handle full HD video files which are the files that would really take the screen to the max. If you are planning on using it to watch videos and don't care much about picture quality and browsing quality, then the screen is not gonna be much better than other lower resolution screens.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of using laptop speakers I always try to have headphones with me, but these laptop speakers work amazingly. They are not crazy loud, you probably won't be able to use them in loud environments but they don't sound tinny like most other laptops I've had, to the point that I don't bother going out of my way to take headphones with me. If you are planning on listening to music perhaps headphones are worth bringing but, for browsing and checking some youtube videos they are perfectly capable.<br/><br/>Battery life is... Relative. As always the 9 hours battery life they claim it can get, I have not been able to get. I expect you can get 7 or maybe 8 with lowest screen brightness and doing low CPU stuff. I've manage to get 3 to maybe 4 hours of video playback with a good amount of brightness, Still good enough for me.<br/><br/>Keyboard is pretty good, A bit unusual if you've never used a chromebook but I've had no problems with it so far.<br/>Touchpad I'm not a fan of but, It gets the job done so I guess that's ok. It's a bit hard to do click and drag because the button is part of the touchpad itself but, it's a trade off to get more touchpad real state so that's just a design preference.<br/><br/>It gets hot if you are using it on your lap and watching videos or doing intensive activities maybe playing games. Fortunately only the bottom gets hot and near the screen so the touchpad is always cool and the keyboard only gets warm. You can use it on your lap if you are just browsing the web.<br/><br/>I had very high expectations of this laptop and for the most part it has manage to fulfill them, a few small problems and battery life didn't blow me away but it is a great laptop none the less.
I purchased the Toshiba Chromebook 2 from Amazon.com rather than .co.uk due to the scarcity of the machine here in the United Kingdom. It does periodically go on sale here but sells out within hours even at our vastly over inflated prices. I was already a fan of Chromebooks in general and was relatively happy with the 14" HP one I've had for a couple of years now but there was room for improvement in several areas and short of buying the Google Pixel for over $1000 this seemed on the face of it to be the best possible alternative and it hasn't disappointed. In fact this Toshiba model exceeded all my expectations and showed just how far the manufacturing of Chromebooks has come in a very short space of time. My 14" HP machine regularly overheated (due to my own heavy use) so its fan was constantly running and this was becoming a noisier annoyance as time went on. By comparison I push the Toshiba 2 just as hard and the silence from its non existent fan is a joy to my ears. I used a cooling pad for my HP machine and regularly had this running its 2 fans at the same time as its own one just to combat the heat. The Toshiba 2 has never reached a temperature where I've felt it could do with some cooling and sits only on the same pad now for comfort.<br/><br/>A couple of other obvious improvements of this over the HP 14" (and almost all other Chromebooks built over a year ago) is the fantastic truly HD screen and the clarity of audio c/o Skullcandy. It's never going to compete with a home cinema/sound system but for a notebook sized machine it is quite impressive especially when used in conjunction with a certain Chrome extension which functions as a graphic EQ. Where the audio really excels is with headphones plugged in though, it's far better than I had expected and gets used daily by me over and above my TV or HiFi system.<br/><br/>I get a slightly higher upload/download speed with the Toshiba 2 with its 802.11ac wireless card v HP's 802.11b/g/n one but again the real difference there is the HP would be revving up its fan like it was preparing for a Formula 1 race while the Toshiba 2 just silently gets on with the job - although uploading large files slows both machines down considerably, downloading not so much, but whether that is indicative of a 4GB CB limitation or my less than stellar ISP's traffic management (throttling) policies I'm unsure.<br/><br/>I have no complaints at all with the Toshiba 2 and consider it worth every penny (or rather, cent!) I spent on it. That said, I would rather it had an extra one or two USB ports and room for memory/CPU expansion. I already max out my home bandwith capabilities wirelessly but some may see the lack of an ethernet port as another feature it lacks although good quality USB > ethernet adapters are cheap (about £10-£15) and work well in my past experience. I don't use my 14" HP Chromebook at all now but I made good use of it while it was my only CB and I had almost filled my free 100GB Google Drive with all kinds of media and documents. I simply granted my new gmail account I use for the Toshiba 2 full access to that cloud space so can seamlessly use both drives from one Chromebook which is a real bonus and a tribute to Google and all developers involved in the Chromium project. By comparison I received 1TB of free Microsoft One space with a small Windows notebook I purchased and have barely used it. It doesn't allow streaming of recorded TV or movies within a home network so whatever gets uploaded to it must be downloaded again to watch or listen to defying the whole purpose and spirit of cloud file management. They may as well have given me a free 1TB external drive but I digress too much.....suffice to say I'm very happy with the Toshiba 2 and at the price (less than I paid for the HP 14" one 2 years ago) consider it the best buy I've made in many years of technological purchases. Just know what you're getting into (ie. this is ChromeOS not Windows and both have their own particular advantages over each other) and I guarantee this won't disappoint.  I have more powerful Windows laptops and desktops that lie idle most of the time because as time has progressed I find less and less tasks I need to use them for that the Chromebook can't do equally well if not better. I'm excited for the future of ChromeOS and would like to see manufacturers include room for internal hardware expansion that doesn't conflict with the OS's sandboxed environment but for now I'd recommend the Toshiba CB2 to anyone looking for an affordable but highly performing (and blissfully quiet) Chromebook.
I bought the Toshiba Chromebook to use in what I call "chromebook" mode meaning I use it for web surfing, email, youtube, netflix, pandora, and everything else a chromebook is supposed to do and it does it well...really well. The keyboard is a nice size "full" keyboard meaning the size is good even for my big fingers. The display...WOW...the resolution is awesome, HD movies and youtube is way better than I expected. The trackpad is a little different than what I am used to (right click, scrolling, etc) but that is a bonus with the scrolling and right click gestures on this Chromebook, very easy to use and get used to coming from a "windows" frame of mind. The speakers without headphones are "good"....but put some earbuds or earphones in and OMG the sound is fantastic! Skull candy hit it out of the park, listen to audio on it without headphone/earbuds...and your like....ahh its ok...but put the headphones/earbuds on and its AWESOME and a totally different experience.<br/><br/>Now to the geek portion of this review, average users need not read on.<br/>I bought the chromebook to use it "chromebook" mode and also use it in enterprise Citrix VDI Xendesktop/Xenapp mode. After installing Citrix Storefront I was easily able to use the Citrix receiver to use published apps in Xen App and desktops from XenDesktop. The Citrix Receiver will not work with the "Citrix Web Interface" you will need to upgrade the Citrix Web Interface to Citrix Storefront, or you can host both Citrix Web Interface and Citrix Storefront on the same webserver to both serve legacy Citrix ICA/Receiver clients along with the Citrix Receiver for Chrome/OS users on Chromebooks. Long story short, this Chromebook is suited for the average user AND in the enterprise.
Update: after using this for several months for work, academic research, and too many hours of Netflix, I'm in love. The combination of battery life, useful productivity, ease of use, and low cost (stolen? no tears shed) make this the best laptop I've ever owned. And I'm used to owning $2k+ business machines.<br/><br/>Bottom line: I used to be a power user, and I'm very fussy about display quality. I took a chance on this Chromebook and, after using it heavily for three weeks, am confident that I'll be selling my ultrabook and moving completely away from Windows-based portable computing.<br/><br/>I have installed the Elementary OS desktop using Crouton (a way of running Linux on top of Chrome OS for more flexibility) because there are still some things that Chrome OS just doesn't do. Like UNZIP files. Really, now, Google... can you please fix this bug? Show-stopper limitations are few and far between, and power users do have the option of switching into Linux. For regular users, Chrome OS is 99% ready for prime time, and I would readily recommend a Chromebook to my parents (and look forward to doing so, as it will reduce the number of technical support calls I receive)!<br/><br/>Pros: The display is outstanding for the price. I have no complaints. The processor is fast enough that under routine use I've experienced no slowdowns or other problems. Complex web applications (e.g. Chrome Experiments) work flawlessly and streaming media plays at full HD without stuttering, even with other tabs open and active. Battery life is excellent, on the order of 10-12 hours of document or presentation editing at 30% brightness or 5-6 hours of movie playback at moderate brightness.<br/><br/>Cons: The Chromebook I received from Amazon had a non-functional USB port and an extra screw that was rattling around, loose in the case. I was unable to exchange, and would have had to pay well above retail for a replacement thanks to the popularity of this model. Dealing with Toshiba was unpleasant enough that if this Chromebook ever fails, I'll let my credit card company's warranty program sort it out. In the end, I had a local repair company remove the screw and re-solder the USB port at my expense. This is, I suppose, what you get when you buy from the bargain bin.<br/><br/>In the end, this product is such an incredible value for the money that I'm still a Chromebook advocate. Consider a secondary warranty or purchase using a credit card with good consumer protection.
EDIT: Make sure your wireless router is using only the WPA AES protocol, not TKIP.  Your speedtest will not be up to par with TKIP.<br/><br/>Let's start with the problems, since Chromebooks tend to be more equal.  The microphone level is too high on this chromebook and that causes a static sound in the speakers of your web chat partner when doing a video call.  I found plugging something in the external jack and unplugging it would help clear it up.  You still need the other party on the call to tell you if they can't hear you.  Overall, not the experience I was hoping for when this is primarily a communication device.<br/>The second problem is the size of the display icons.  The high definition resolution is nice, looks great for pictures, but reading text is way too small along with icons.  I use a much lower resolution.  The icons only get slightly less sharp.  For some reason the Google Hangout app gets much more blurry.  The text at a lower resolution is very good then.<br/>Those are the only problems, but they are important to keep in mind.  The microphone problem might be on other devices too.  Google should have a way to adjust the level of the mic since it is possible inside Linux, just enable it.<br/><br/>The positives.  IPS display makes it way easier to see from any angle.  You'll never want to go back to old style TFT displays.  Colors are much better  The weight of this laptop is great, very easy to be mobile.  The size is right.  I wouldn't want to go any smaller than a 13.3 inch display and size keyboard.  Long battery life, fast charging.<br/><br/>I wouldn't let the negatives stop me from buying another one.  Hopefully they get fixed in future updates.  The IPS display is the reason you want to buy this Chromebook over the other models.
Day... I don't know.. ugh... 6? Last update to conclude my review.<br/><br/>I am not returning it. While the sluggishness is there, it is not a deal breaker. Nobody expects this to be as fast and high-performing as a $500+ laptop, but in most situations, it does the job just as well. I've had no problem typing up documents and creating spreadsheets using the Google apps (which also work offline). And the awesomeness of the screen simply outweighs all cons. I'm definitely keeping this (unless something amazing is announced this week at CES).<br/><br/>The only question that remains is whether or not it's worth the $100 (or $150) upgrade from a cheaper, smaller, but faster C720/p? Well, probably not. If you just need something to take notes in classes, or browse websites on-the-go, I would suggest you save your money and get the 11" C720. However, I do a lot of reading, some photo works and video streaming on my chromebook, and this Toshiba Chromebook 2 is perfect for that.<br/><br/>**********************<br/><br/>Day 3: After testing various video streaming websites, I've come to the conclusion that this CB can surely decode 1080p, but does have problems with certain web players. For some reason, the NBC Sports Live Extra website utilizes several players. Some run smoothly, while others (as reported before) are crap. Netflix, Hulu and others are perfectly fine though. The lag problem also extends to rendering and scrolling on websites with lots of images though. So definitely check this out in person if it sounds like something of a deal-breaker to you.<br/><br/>I just realized that I haven't said anything about the battery life. Well, it's great! At least as good as the C720, which is huge considering how much bigger/brighter/better the screen is. I can go through a day and a half of casual use at 50-60% brightness (or about 6-7 hours of actual usage).<br/><br/>Now the question still remains. Is the amazing screen enough for me to keep this CB?<br/><br/>***********************<br/><br/>Day 2: I really enjoy using this Chromebook, largely thanks to the beautiful screen. It's bright. It's vibrant. It's IPS! AND IT'S 1080p! This screen makes a huge difference when you do a lot of reading/web browsing. It is, however, glossy and quite reflective. Not a big deal if you won't be using it outdoors or near bright lights. But keep this in mind, as a lot of people hate glossy screen.<br/><br/>Now here comes the not-so-good news, it is definitely slower than my C720. As mentioned, slower but more efficient processor along with a higher resolution screen. For normal usage, it doesn't affect performance much. However, I tried streaming live TV on NBC Live Extra website today and it was horrible. I had nothing but one tab running, and video was skipping and lagging. Yikes! First real problem I've encountered that makes me question my decision to keep this Chromebook. I watch a lot of sports on my Chromebook. Maybe it's just NBC website? I'll test a few more to and get back to you on this.<br/><br/>I'm also still getting used to carrying this 13.3" laptop around. The C720 was 11" and it was tiny. I can easily hold it with one hand. This, while being roughly the same weight, is wider and more unwieldy. Of course, it was expected.<br/><br/>***********************<br/><br/>So I upgraded from an Acer C720 which has a pretty s***ty screen, as is the case with most Chromebooks. Just got the Toshiba today and boy oh boy, the 1080p IPS screen blows away the competition.<br/><br/>Early thoughts:<br/>- Nice, simple and clean design. A Macbook clone, but it works.<br/>- Screen is amazing, obviously.<br/>- Keyboard is nicely spaced and responsive, but then again it's a 13" laptop. Trackpad also nice.<br/>- Sound is decent. I didn't expect amazing hifi quality from speakers under the keyboard, wasn't disappointed.<br/>- I feel like it's noticeably (but only slightly) slower than the C720 (processor is slower, but more power efficient). Not a deal breaker, but it's there.<br/>- Full-sized HDMI! Always a plus.<br/><br/>Will update review after I've given it a few days.
Had mine for a month now and so far it works like a charm. I was on the fence for a long time before this purchase -- should I go Chrome or find something cheap that still had Windows 7? Then what brand Chromebook, then was it worth the extra $80 for this Toshiba over their 2GB standard res version. But now I can confidently say try a Chromebook, and at $329 this model in particular.<br/><br/>It's wonderfully simple. Less than five minutes out of the box and I was already online.(I already had gmail and dabbled with the Chrome browser on my Windows 7 desktop, which helps if you are considering a Chromebook). Connectivity seems fine, even out on my porch. Boots up and shuts down just about instantly, accesses websites faster than my desktop (which could not even get into one site for a Cyber Monday deal while the Toshiba bulled right through). Streams smoothly for live sports or YouTube (though I am only a three-tab-at-a-time kinda guy, nothing too heavy).<br/><br/>The high-res display is sharp and colorful, looks fine even in standard res. One warning: Websites, icons and menus will look awfully small in high res so you may want to go into settings to make everything bigger (or use standard res for tasks that are not highly visual). At first I was also adjusting the zoom a lot on individual websites, but the computer at least seems to remember the level you've set for each site. Overall, while my desktop has a nice 20-inch screen I don't feel cheated looking at this 13-incher. And it's wonderfully light and slim without feeling cheap or flimsy; hinges seem fine. Keyboard's OK, though those pretentious lower-case letters on the keys could be bigger and bolder. I hadn't used a trackpad in years but this one has been easy to pick up on. The device also is silent and barely gets warm at all.<br/><br/>The Skullcandy speakers have been much touted but to me they sound just a bit better than you'd expect from a machine this size. Clear and punchy enough in the high range but no bass, so not much of a musical experience. Deduct half a star for that -- but I do enjoy using it around the house as a handy interference-free radio to stream talk and news (as the AM interference really is horrible around here). Battery life seems fine (compared to one relative's Toshiba Satellite, which now goes into death throes after barely an hour).<br/><br/>There are many things a little Chromebook won't do, but if you just want to be online without the delays and frustrations of Windows this model might be just what you or a family member need, especially as a very portable second computer.
In a sentence: The best computer under $800, at less than $350.<br/>I'm honestly amazed by how great a laptop Google has made with this chromebook, This has replaced my Macbook Air as my day-to-day laptop. Good enough battery life is met with an amazing display, good keyboard, fantastic speakers and beautiful software.<br/>I used a CR48 back in the day, had a Series 5 at work, used a Samsung chromebook but this, bought with my own money, is an amazing deal.
It has almost entirely replaced my windows desktop PC. I rarely use my desktop pc, and when i do it's usually to play video games.<br/><br/>This Chromebook (4gb 1080p screen model) handles and extra monitor beautifully.<br/><br/>The only con about this Chromebook is printing. You need a wifi enabled printer to print or a printer plunged into a windows machine, and connected online. The set up was a bit confusing, but i eventually figured it out.
Best Chromebook on the market. I previously owned the Acer c720, but wanted to upgrade to a laptop with a better screen and larger form factor since I find 13 inch Laptops to be personal sweet spot for functionality and portability.<br/><br/>This is an awesome laptop. Chrome OS has it's limitations, but once you get a hang of it it's a worry free OS that is super reliable.<br/><br/>The screen on this laptop is awesome. Everything is crystal clear and I love that it does not have the matte finish that is so common on other "Full HD" Chromebooks. The screen is great, you could easily be fooled into thinking this screen belongs to a much more expensive Windows or Mac laptop.<br/><br/>Some have voiced concern about the processor, but unless you are a tab hog, I honestly don't see how you would notice any slowdown. the 4GB of RAM ensures this baby operates smoothly and Chrome OS is extremely lightweight, so it doesnt take the newest or fastest chip to ensure great performance.<br/><br/>Let's put it this way, I also own an HP Stream 13 since, let's face it, every now and then you need a machine that has Windows or OS X on it, but the HP Stream operates like a sloth in comparison to this Chromebook. That may change with Windows 10, since Microsoft has made a big deal about their programs working on any and all devices, but for the time being in a battle of low cost laptops this is the clear winner over anything Microsoft or HP can produce on the low cost Windows side.
I purchased this in October and I've absolutely loved it. The IPS 1080p display is fantastic and really pulls the whole thing together.<br/><br/>The only cons I've had with it are:<br/><br/>1) The screen, though amazing, is too glossy to use in a well lit environment and especially not outside. I've had to install a matte screen protector to compensate and installing such things on a laptop screen always leaves bubbles.<br/><br/>2) 1080p60 videos on youtube run as slideshows rather than videos. Even 720p60 is a struggle. Regular 1080p runs super well, but I'm disappointed with 60fps video performance.<br/><br/>3) Crouton works great with this, but dual booting is not really an option due to the Bay Trail Celeron.<br/><br/>To rectify these issues, I've been considering replacing it with the new acer chromebook 15 due to the matte 1080p screen, and actual Broadwell processor for significantly better performance. The battery life on the acer is also supposed to be a bit better. I'm hesitant though as sdcards don't sit flush with the casing like they do on the Toshiba (64gb Transcend card has worked great), and the acer has a fan while the Toshiba doesn't. Additionally, the Toshiba is incredibly compact and I've had several people mistake it for the macbook air, whereas the acer is about the same size as those 15 inch clunky windows laptops that many of us are trying to avoid.
After lots of research on the available options, I settled on this Toshiba Chromebook.  My wife previously had an ASUS Chromebook.  It worked great, but was getting a little long in the tooth, so it was time to upgrade.  I love Chromebooks in general.  I'm an IT guy, so I know how to maintain Windows laptops, but it's so nice to give somebody a Chromebook and know that you'll have zero maintenance.  NOT SO with this Chromebook.  It initially worked well, but after a few months, websites started to open REALLY slow or would just completely lock up.  My wife was getting really frustrated.  Other laptops worked fine on our WiFi.  I tried a different WiFi at work.  I tried resetting the Chromebook (via the powerwash feature).  Nothing worked and there's not much more you can do with a Chromebook.  That's the idea.<br/><br/>I finally called Toshiba support and they quickly told me to send it in.  I paid the $30 and sent it in.  I didn't hear a thing until I got the laptop back with a note that it was working.  I can only assume that somebody turned it on, tried a webpage and said it's working.  That's the problem when you have something that is acting up, but not completely black and white broken.<br/><br/>I complained to Toshiba and heard nothing.  At this point, I give up and accept that it's money wasted.  Toshiba, poor product, poor support.  You've lost a customer for life.
Was looking for something lightweight and nice looking for grad school, but I couldn't find any standard Windows laptops for under $700, and they all had issues. I already have an aging Dell E6430 laptop, so I figured I would give a Chromebook a shot. I ended up purchasing the Toshiba Chromebook 2 due to the beautiful screen (puts my Dell to shame), 4GB of RAM, and the design (dimpled lid and base, great build quality). This computer is a dream to use, literally boots in 2-3 seconds, and the screen is gorgeous. Oh, the battery life? I'm getting about 9-10 hours at ~30% brightness. The Chromebook is blazing fast, and with 4GB of memory, I don't expect any slowdowns. Now I don't run 4 instances of advanced IT software at once, but I do run SiriusXM and Google Music in the background, and I don't see any lag or performance issues. If you're in the market for a Chromebook, and I would highly recommend that you give them a look if you need a thin/light fast laptop without breaking the bank, I would recommend the Toshiba Chromebook 2 due to the screen and memory. Please avoid the plethora of $200 Windows 10 laptops. It may seem like a good idea, but trust me, it's not. Research how Chromebooks work (hint: almost everything is cloud based), and then proceed to your retailer of choice. Ignore the salesmen when he tries to sell you a Windows PC, and buy this Toshiba.
Bought this a couple of weeks ago and I'm happy with it.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- The screen is as beautiful as everybody says...it basically looks as good as any MacBook/iPad whatever you've seen.<br/>- Nice design, looks high-end, very hefty (some say too heavy but I like the feel).<br/>- Nice keyboard (this is a matter of taste I guess but I like it a lot).<br/>- ChromeOS is awesome...such a great experience being able to powerwash and wipe everything clean with one button.<br/>- Runs Crouton very well for those wanting you try out linux on their chromebook.<br/>- The 4GB RAM makes multitasking very good...I'm able to have tons of tabs and things open without a noticeable performance drop.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- The battery life is even worse than I had read. I was reading things like 8-9 hours but I'm getting more like 6-7 with web browsing. Still, it's enough for my purposes.<br/>- The processor is noticeably underpowered...it's enough for my purposes but you'll often feel like if it was just a tiny bit faster it would be a perfect machine...I would have been willing to dish out $50 more or something for a little more speed but there is no option of course. As mentioned above, multi-tasking is fine, it's just the individual load speeds that you'll notice on web pages or opening apps.
Best computer ever!!! it is so fast, turns on quickly, the resolution is better than my flat screen!  i use google for everything: lesson plans, email, reports, organizing my pics.  the interface is super user friendly.
Got this for my husband to try and teach him to use a computer.<br/>Fast, easy to use. I miss some of the features from my PC but for alot of reasons this is great.<br/>Fast, lightweight and seems very secure
Very satisfied.<br/><br/>My Macbook is 8 years old.  Wanted to upgrade to Macbook retina for long, but it is relatively expensive.  Then here comes a Toshiba Chromebook 2 with 1080P ips display, and much cheaper.  OK, give it a try Chrome OS.<br/><br/>Display<br/>It is all about the display.  It is the reason to click me in.  And it turns out not disappointed.  The 1080p IPS display is very nice, very bright and clear.  It is a glossy but can live with that.<br/><br/>Overall Built<br/>It is made with plastic, Built quality could be better.  Keyboard and Trackpad is quite good btw, and responsive.  Speaker is surprising good for a cheap 'notebook'.<br/><br/>Performance<br/>Performance is ok, sometimes lags and slow. Overall it is ok good.  Of course Chromebook turns on within seconds.  I can open up 7, 8 tab pages without problem.<br/><br/>Overall very happy with this chromebook.  Chrome OS is quite good and meet the expectation.  Hope future update can improve the videos playing (Now no sound when play MKV files).  The Chrome OS is not fully ready with the 1080p display yet, making all the things very small. Change the zoom or lower the resolution can help.<br/><br/>Amazon services is as good as always.
Been wanting to update my 2007 ultra portable laptop (under 3 lbs).  Looked at all options:  tablets, 2-in-1, pc, mac, chromebook.  Need mostly for surfing but also able to handle business when traveling.<br/>Mac - way too expensive for my needs.  Have not used Apple for many years, but not a problem to learn.<br/>PC - hate Win8.  Too many updates and usually takes place during inopportune times.  2-in-1's and ultra portable still expensive.<br/>Tablets - don't want to download an app to do everything.<br/><br/>Chromebook - until recently, CB's were not quick or serious enough for my needs, but HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED FOR THE BETTER!<br/><br/>Chrome Remote Desktop allows me to still manage business on my PC remotely when traveling.  All my "heavy lifting" software is on a Win7 PC.  Boots up quickly.  Allows multi-user so the whole family (and guest) can use it.  Lightweight.  Long battery life (can last a full day of average use).  Handles 95% of my needs (the remaining 5% needs to be done on my PC with a big monitor).  Super quiet.  Great screen resolution.  Google constantly improving Chrome OS with minimal upgrade hassle.
I have had every recent chromebook with the exception of the Samsung Chromebook 2(Acer C720, Asus 13 inch, HP 14, and Toshiba Chromebook). The Toshiba Chromebook 2 with IPS display is without a doubt the very best Chromebook to date. A great screen, a great keyboard, a great touch pad and a great form factor. I absolutely love it so far.<br/><br/>Update: After using this for a while now, I returned it. Performance is a bit too sluggish, 1080 on a 13 inch screen is not good for my older eyes and I did not get close to the advertised battery life. I replaced it with an Acer CB3 and I'm happier with it. The screens and sound are no comparison, but it is much cheaper, lighter, better battery life and generally performs better. At least for me.  And yes I have wiped my machine many times.
I just received this computer today and I've got to say, from my first couple hours of use with it, they nailed it. Screen, as everyone says, is perfect. I'd consider myself a power user and I'm not noticing any lags of any significance. I'm coming from an Acer 720 and I can't say I've noticed much of a difference in performance. Important to do the Chrome update. I'm mainly using Google Apps and other online services including photos and accounting. Speakers are very good though not much bass. No youtube stuttering. Writing this now with 8 tabs open including Google Play Music running. Battery life looks like it won't nearly match the Acer. But keyboard huge step up in addition to everything else. Overall build seems very solid. No creaks. I like the aesthetics. Track pad totally fine. Biggest initial issue is that the Chrome browser tabs are tiny. I thought there was a Chrome flag to fix that but haven't found it. Also gets a bit on the warm side on my lap whereas Acer doesn't (Acer has a fan). I'll see how it fares over the coming days but looks like this has everything I need.<br/>Update January 2015:<br/>I returned it. While it's a beautiful machine with a great screen and speakers, ultimately you're just setting yourself up for buying the perfect chromebook when it comes out in a year (or sooner). I did start to notice irritating lags that I didn't have on the 720 but the dealbreaker was the battery life. I decided to wait but with Google's offer of 2 years of 1TB free Drive space, I picked up the Acer Chromebook 13 Tegra and it's got the battery life the Toshiba doesn't. Screen doesn't compare but it's still 1080 and is snappier. I needed that extra 1TB on top of the 1TB I pay $10/mo for and it's effectively a free computer so I went for it.
The best thing about this Toshiba Chromebook is the display. It rivals displays I have used on much more expensive laptops. The performance is also quite good. You can juggle quite a few tabs without things feeling laggy. The touchpad works fine but feels a little fragile... like it could cave into the laptop body if you pressed it too hard. The Touchpad is really the only reminder that this is an inexpensive device. On the other hand the keyboard is quite nice. I have no issues whatsoever with the keyboard. Overall this is an excellent laptop with long battery life. Highly recommended as long as a Chromebook does everything you need. If you are not familiar with the limitations of running ChromeOS vs Windows or Mac OS-X, read up on that before you purchase a Chromebook.I will say one more thing about the build quality: This laptop slid off a counter and landed on one of its corners. I expected the display to be cracked and something else to be broken, but everything was just fine.The plastic body looks aluminum from a distance, but it doesn't attract fingerprints like aluminum.
I am very satisfied with this product. But , don't think you are buying something that it is not. This laptop runs a bare bones OS that uses the internet to do anything. It wont run iTunes, it wont install Microsoft office, it wont do photo shop and it wont install games. If you want these things, move on. However, what this laptop does, it does well. It is blazing fast on the internet, I have no problem with Netflix connectivity and streams beautifully in 1080p on this gorgeous screen. Its a good choice for a student if they have a Gmail (which you will have to make if you dont have one) because of Googles excellent Drive suite. It is an excellent set of online based programming that simulates office well and is far better for collaboration among students. It also runs most online homework programs like MyMathLab and Connect. If you need a computer that can run heavy programs like those for engineering students, most campuses have labs students can use to do them. Also, this computer is good for a mobile system. I personally have a beast of a desktop but need this for class to take notes, etc. as far as build quality, its solid. most computers I hold feel very fragile but I beleive this thing can take a hit. It has an all around matte finish which is nice for hiding finger oils which gross me out and leaves me constantly cleaning my computers. I have had people, who sit behind me, ask if I bought a Macbook because it borrows so heavily from their look. Track pad is responsive and keys have a nice click and I dont have be gentle with them, Im a big guy with big hands and they move around the keys well. Overall, very happy with this purchase, but DO NOT buy this thing at full price as it regularly goes on sale online and a retailers( I got mine at best buy for 300 tax included at local retailer "GOOD PURCHASE" ( you can guess the name)
A good performant chromebook - with a well-done human interface - at a reasonable price. Good screen, keyboard and touchpad.<br/><br/>Oh - and sooo easy to setup and start using.
This device is great, it can do everything a basic user needs. I surf, chat, video and then some; and on this date of 11/26/14 it only costs 329.00 @ Best Buy.<br/>This device is so perfect for the non gamers, like my mother. I can carry this thing around and not worry about damaging it.<br/>Plug ins are limited; but this can be a good thing for people that love to click on unknown attachments or web links.<br/>I have had this device for a week now and I have not had an issue with going to common websites.<br/>I've watched network and cable TV/Netflix/Hulu and Amazon Prime.<br/><br/>Pro:<br/>Fast/speedy<br/>Works like chrome on the pc<br/>bright<br/>1080p is awesome<br/>1tb google drive for 2 years (offer ends)<br/>I have excellent battery life so far<br/>Chromecast is exceptional<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>There is some light bleed, but I only notice it on full black screens in 4 sections (it's like lights on a billboard, but not that bright)<br/>It's limited to google software<br/>Keyboard doesn't light up :(
I will not get into what a Chromebook is.  What it will do or can't do.  I will only say that this Toshiba B3340 has become my primary machine and daily driver over all the other so called "real" computers.  This does EVERYTHING I need it to do.  It has the BEST screen on any device that my family has.<br/>I am convinced that the nay-sayers are against these devices because after spending over a thousand dollars on their "real" computers...they find that this machine does the same stuff, just as fast and has a better screen to boot.  Only much, MUCH less expensive.<br/>We have a HP, Mac Pro and a new Surface 3...Not one comes close to the feel and response of this Toshiba.  No virus or Malware to worry about and it boots in seconds. The 13 inch screen is a perfect compromise of having a bigger screen while being easy to carry to class or work.<br/>If you are thinking about ANY laptop I urge you to consider this Toshiba with the 1080P screen.  It is THAT good...maybe better than good.
I've had my Toshiba Chromebook 2 for a fortnight now and am thrilled I decided to purchase this particular model. The screen is the clincher ... no picture or You Tube review can do it justice. On lighting it up for the first time I was gobsmacked ! The colours, sharpness and clarity really do have to be seen to be believed. Buy it for the screen alone and you are way ahead of the game. I had read in a few posts that there were a few concerns re. build quality. Mine seems to be very well put together ... screws on the bottom nice and tight, hinges firm, and the general appearance for all the world that of a unit one would expect to pay far more for. The Skullcandy speakers are neither here nor there. I suspect a bit of hype here but they are perfectly serviceable and I'm not aware of too many people who buy any computer for its superior sound quality. Performance is more than enough for my needs. A really good buy. One caveat: Toshiba should bite the bullet and sack The Sticker Guy !
We bought TWO of these Chromebooks and BOTH have the same problem- the screws on the bottom become loose and sometimes fall out.  We called Toshiba Support (1800-618-4444) and were told that the one year warrenty covers defects in the hardware, but screws falling out somehow do not qualify as defects.  They believe it could be external circumstances causing the screws to fall out.  Well this could make sense, if it wasn't happening to TWO different computers, used by TWO different people.  I complained and was given a case number.and told I could opt to take the computers in and pay for the repair myself.  Toshiba should honor their warrenty- rather than pretending that the problem does not exist.  Looking at the reviews on Amazon, I can see this is a common problem with Toshiba Chromebooks.  A simple Google search brings up many more people with the same problem.<br/><br/>So, a good computer- if it doesn't fall apart on us.  Might opt for a different brand next time.
Screen is great, keyboard is a little squishy but for the money it's hand down  the best option out there if you're into the Google ecosystem.
AWESOME, own a Mac Book Pro, this inexpensive Chromebook has a better screen and great keyboard. Wondering why I spend all that money on Apple
This is my second Chromebook and my old Samsung pales in comparison.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-incredible screen.  Really, really nice.<br/>-better sound than most laptops<br/>-nice trackpad<br/>-good keyboard<br/>-fast wireless<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-I dislike the rough texture of the case.  YMMV.<br/>-no thumb indent on the case.  It can actually be hard to open this laptop.<br/>-I would have liked the option to pay a little more for a better processor.  The Celeron isn't bad but it could be better.<br/>-no backlit keyboard.  While this isn't a deal breaker, I'd have gladly ponied up a few more bucks to have this option.<br/><br/>It'll be interesting to see if Toshiba continues to up the ante with this line.  I'd be very happy to see a slightly more expensive Chromebook from them with even more bells and whistles.
Not the cheapest, but definitely the BEST chromebook on the market right now, totally worth the little bit extra!!! Absolutely love it!!
I wasnt sure how I was going to feel about ChromeOS, being web based and not having traditional applications.. but after using it for a bit, now I am completely satisfied with the purchase.  I am a pro photographer, so I was unsure if this would meet my needs, but it is able to handle 98% of what I need a laptop to do (obviously my editing will always be desktop based).  Super light, perfect size, beautiful screen, great style.. perfect for client meetings or dumping cards while on a shoot (sd reader and usb3 help in that regard). It boots in seconds, literally takes more time to type my password than start up.  Awesome little machine, and for $300, its a no brainer, esp if you are already utilizing google products. Honestly, I like it quite a bit more than my previous macbook pro for my laptop needs.
This is my first ever review. I really love this computer. Seriously. The first one that I ordered didn't work correctly (very very molasses slow), so I sent it back to try again. The second computer did the same really annoying thing at start-up (spending forever trying to configure device), so I just restarted it and it's been great ever since. I work on Apples at work, and I wanted one, but didn't want to splurge, so this fit the bill with simplicity, security, beauty, functionality, and speed. It meets all of my needs with Docs and Sheets and the terabyte of cloud storage. I wouldn't buy another PC since I heard that Windows 7 and 8 are not intuitive, and since they stopped supporting XP so my 2 perfectly good computers were suddenly obsolete.<br/><br/>Oh and the screen absolutely rocks!
This is probably the best Chromebook out right now. It's got a nice grippy matte plastic body, beautiful IPS screen, good keyboard and trackpad, and some surprisingly decent speakers.<br/><br/>It wont win any speed contests but it doesn't get too warm, and the battery seems to last around 8 hours. Though it's not as good of a battery as some Chromebooks, the screens on those other machines are genuinely terrible. This is a better tradeoff.<br/><br/>1080p is really great if you got eagle eyes, or genuinely ok with zooming on pages you want to read. Some people will turn off 1080p permanently but still get a crisp IPS experience at 1536 x 864. This resolution isn't as much of a selling point as the IPS panel itself. This is a pretty great screen.
CONS:  Text is very small unless zoomed considerably.  PROS:  Rich FHD screen  Silent running<br/>  Slower than I anticipated.  Great audio output  No overheating<br/>  Trackpad is fussy  Comfortable high accuracy keyboard  Feels great to use<br/>  Delete key absence is annoying  Easy setup VPN  Unbelievable battery life<br/>  Some video files won't play (obviously)  Multiple windows can be used at once  Light as a feather<br/><br/>You may want to hold onto your Mac or PC until the Chrome OS hits Glide. Once you start cloud computing you won't go back though.<br/>Don't compare it to other systems. It is a Chromebook. It is the future of computing and you sure can't beat the price.<br/><br/>  Endless storage<br/>  Incredible battery life
I love this computer.  Hours of life, a good screen, no power limitations (so far) and no windows lag.  Just love it!
Great Laptop, fast, simple to use. Great replacement for Windows laptop. Lack of HDD space is not a problem.
Beautiful 1080p HD screen. Really lightweight. Good battery life. Great track pad with multi-gesture commands. Start up time is super fast. Only complaint is it does get a little laggy when you have more than 5 or so tabs open, but that doesn't happen too much so not a big complaint. I was a little hesitant to make the jump from a Windows based laptop to Chrome, but so far I haven't had any problems. I was already heavily invested in Google since I have an Android phone, and I use Gmail and Google Drive, so the switch just made sense. The "apps" for Spotify and Netflix have made the switch even easier. Very happy with my purchase.
I've had this laptop for a few months now and I can say the following:<br/><br/>I now use it as my go to laptop, it replaced my Windows laptop.<br/>It's extremely light-weight<br/>The screen is phenomenal for the price.<br/>Boot up time is excellent, within 5 seconds it's up and running.<br/>Added bonus -- 100GB upgrade for google drive.<br/>I purchased this shortly after it was released and got it a great price- I have seen this going for more than 350.00 now.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a Chromebook.  It definitely has one of the, if not THE best screens available on Chromebooks.
I purchased this as a laptop alternative for traveling, and use it for grad school work. The screen is gorgeous, and the sound is good, and it's a great size. The only thing I really don't like is the tiny tiny text on the Chrome tabs, bookmarks bar, and the URL address box. Enlarging text on a web page is no big deal, just hit Ctrl+, but the only way to enlarge that microscopic text in the tabs and other controls in the web browser is to change the display resolution. I did that and the screen now looks crappy, which totally defeats the purpose of the gorgeous screen. Wish I could find a work around for that.
Purchased this to serve as an interim laptop until the next round of Macbook releases. Has become the go to machine for couch surfing, web and email. Quality construction and really the best Chromebook display out there for hi-res duty. Works well with Chromecast and seldom shudders on the most hi-res streaming video content. Speakers are loud enough to stream with the Sirius Chrome app and use as a mobile listening platform around the house. Install a Chrome RDP app and use it to access another pc. Only drawback is no support for some of the third party VPN services out there.
Worked perfect right out of the box. I plugged it in, opened the lid and about 4 seconds it was up and running. Put in my wifi password and I had access to all my Google chrome setting I have been using for quite awhile. It plays videos with no annoying buffering, the speakers sound great and the touchpad is much smoother than my old laptop. I will never go back to a windows base machine again, all my documents will cross back and forth from office files to Google docs with no problem. It is completely quite with no fan noise or heat cooking your legs.
This Chromebook performs just as described.  The IPS display is very impressive.  Some videos clip a little bit at full screen mode which is disappointing.  Otherwise the only major design flaw is the display opening limitation.  If you have a taller seated height, you may find it difficult to open the screen far enough to see the display at the proper angle.  The current design seems to open to a very arbitrary stopping point.  Ideally, this unit would have been designed to open nearly flat.  This would have allowed for comfortable reclined use.
I was reluctant to buy from Toshiba since I was burned on their AT300 ($400 Android tablet sold with an outdated version of Android with no upgrades). Honestly I am still pretty mad about that. However, I bought this Toshiba Chromebook because there is no problem with upgrades and I was convinced by the other reviews. Most of what I do is cloud based, Outlook, Office, Salesforce, onedrive, google apps, et cetera. This chromebook is fast and reliable and the screen is awesome! I like it so much I bought one for my wife. She love it too.
My H-P Chrome laptop battery died, a replacement battery was rather expensive $99 and installation would have been problematic - likely resulting in damage to connections and/or components. This replacement computer was slightly more expensive than simply replacing the original H-P, but rated a full 'star' higher by Amazon buyers. It was easy to set up and get going, and given the Cloud-based nature of storage associated with Chrome, my passwords and favorite sites were immediately recalled. Display and audio are excellent.
Gorgeous Screen, seems well built. I was worried the Baytrail processor would be too slow but I have 30 tabs open and other applications and it runs fine. No page up/down keys and no delete key is really really annoying. I don't know if I would buy one again until Google stops copying apple with this. This laptop doesn't support wiping chrome and running Linux yet, but crouton runs fine. If you are looking to just run linux then this one isn't for you. Battery life is pretty good, I reckon at least 8 hours browsing.
Perfect for everyday use. Somewhat lacking for developers.<br/><br/>In comparison to a mac air<br/>- The screen is sharp. Sharp as Retina.<br/>- Keyboard is more textured<br/>- Trackpad is lacking<br/>- Battery life is about 8 hours on regular browsing<br/><br/>ChromeOS takes some getting used to. Developing has to be in the cloud (Cloud9 or nitrous.io) unless you boot up ubuntu with crouton, which I haven't yet tried. But if you're not a developer then this chromebook is an excellent, excellent deal.
Beautiful screen.  I love the 1080p.  And I like the simplicity of the Chromebook.
I bought this to cruise the web in my living room and to do simple tasks like check email.  It's a nice machine with a great display.  The colors pop and aren't washed out like they are with cheaper Chromebooks.  It's not a speed demon, but it's not a slouch either.  It can take a few seconds to connect to the internet when you open up the lid.  Other than that, I love this thing.  The simplicity of a tablet but with the form factor of a laptop.  It also has one of the best keyboards I've ever typed on.
Exceeded my expectations. Excellent build quality. Intel processor and Full HD display separates it from its competitors. Outstanding performance while on battery. Chromebook provides superior integration with all Google web services. I'm taking full advantage of the 100 GB Google Drive provided with this purchase. Using my Toshiba Chromebook 2 as my daily driver for most of my work and entertainment. My fat laptop has been collecting a lot dust lately.  Would recommend purchase to friends and family.
This is an excellent chromebook with a great screen. Chances are, if you are in the market for a chromebook you aren't as concerned with processor speed as with other computer options. This laptop does not offer great processing speed, but it does the job for Web browsing, video streaming and other common Web functions. The screen is beautiful, and the laptop is gorgeous. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a computer that fits basic needs , and for someone who wants long battery life.
PRO : Boot very fast. Big and vivid screen. Light weight. So impressed with the loud speaker, it's loud and go from the keyboard. Sometime I put the rubber feet at the bottom back make the sound more direct to me.<br/>  Look alike MacBook Air but so much cheaper. Great for browse internet, listen to music and watch movie.<br/><br/>CON : Chrome OS still not doing well on FULL HD screen. The menu icon and font on desktop so small.<br/>  Movie Player app can't choose audio track and subtitle.
I run a business and do most of my work in browsers so I thought I'd try a chromebook. I also run a podcast. I've had it for about 5 days and I have to say I love it. I've recorded a couple podcast episodes already and it went well. It's super fast. I always have many tabs open to do online marketing so I didn't want it to get slowed down. The battery lasts all day. The keyboard feels good too. The screen quality is awesome and there is a noticable difference with the speakers. I love it!
Absolutely LOVE my Chromebook! I got it a few months ago and my only drawback is that the Google Docs (Chromebook's version of Microsoft) doesn't compare to the actual Microsoft Office. Of course, if you're not a frequent user of Microsoft, this may not me a considerable issue when making your decision to purchase this machine. With that being said, let's get back to the love... I love the keys, the screen, the thinness, the battery life and the overall look of the laptop.
I have used this Chromebook for about 1.5 months.  Overall I like it except I wish the battery lasted longer.  The screen is very clear although some text in chrome os appears very small (eg tabs and url address).  One glaring problem is the screw fasteners on the bottom.  One of mine fell out and 2 others checked out loose!  I have never run into a fastener problem with a laptop computer before.  Locktite should be applied to these screws but appears not to be the case.
I originally gave it 4 stars. But after a couple more months of real-world use by my 4th-grader, I changed my mind.<br/><br/>The laptop is slowly falling apart. The screws at the bottom of the laptop are already coming loose; in fact, one of them fell out completely, and I had to screw it back. While I was at it, I checked the other screws, and every single one of them was loose. WTF?<br/><br/>In addition, the plastic at the bottom of the laptop feels flimsy. If you gently press the  plastic by the edge of the laptop, you can see the seams liberally flex. Maybe I was expecting too much for the price?<br/><br/>I wouldn't buy this again nor would I recommend it to a friend.
As a long-term Toshiba owner, I had high expectations of this chromebook. I have purchased 5 Toshiba laptops in the past 8 years, all with flawless service and performance. My son needed a new chromebook for school and ordered this model, expecting the same performance. I was aware of the reviews about the screen problems and hoped that the problem had been corrected by Toshiba. Unfortunately, it has not. After ten days of use, the upper left corner of the screen became black and many vertical lines appeared on the screen. Fortunately, the defect appeared within the 30-day Amazon return period and it is going back. Other than the major screen issue, this model did perform well. However, I can not recommend a Toshiba chromebook due to this major issue. One star for product quality, five stars for Amazon's return policy and efficiency in issuing a refund. Toshiba should take note of all the complaints concerning this screen and make some serious quality improvements on the screen.
The screen is amazing (IPS HD version). Great contrast, deep color, and very pleasing to view in general.<br/><br/>The keyboard and trackpad are decent. They get the job done. The trackpad is nice and large. The keyboard has shortcuts along the top that are very useful.<br/><br/>Speakers are very much above average for a laptop form factor.<br/><br/>This chromebook does everything I want and need to do - and quite well - for only $320.
Screen is awesome. Only thing is, the edges are little sharp and you can feel it specially when you are lying on the bed and try to browse. But as long as you keep the Laptop on a Table, it's very comfortable in all aspects. Display is much better as it's 1080p when compared to other chromebooks (I have one from Samsung and the display is not appealing at all).<br/><br/>I suggest this to my friends.
Brilliant Chromebook with a magnificent screen - better than any other Chromebook I've seen. I got it four weeks ago, and so far, I am impressed with it, especially taking the price/performance ratio into account. Sure, a Macbook Air is better, but is it 3 times better? Switching to Chrome OS from MacOS has been painless, although a little learning on my side has been necessary - just like I expected
For surfing, checking email, throwing a quick spreadsheet or doc, playing some tunes or watching a flick, no better laptop for the money. But then again, since I ordered my Toshiba Chromebook, received it, wrote this review, I'm sure that there's probably a new Chromebook out. My advice; surf a bit, if you can't find something better then this Chromebook, know you'll completely enjoy this one.
I absolutely love this Chromebook.<br/>You will too if you like to keep your gaming and web browsing SEPARATE like me, or just want smooth browsing on the go.<br/>Light as a feather.<br/>Solid beautiful build quality.<br/>No visible fans or speakers.<br/>Its simply amazing.<br/>Simply buy a 64GB Sony SD card for 18 bucks and you got yourself tons of storage.<br/>Amazing value.
I love this chromebook. It's my first chromebook. I bought this when it was still $299. It came on time, the screen and sound quality is so perfect. I never have a problem using this laptop. I can open too many tabs without any problem. Google chromebook developer should make Skype available on this kind of software. Because not all my friends and family use G+ Hangouts.
I love it! Although I see that I need sometimes office and with the online pack is not always a good thing. But linux can help you with that.<br/>Overall Its fast, eays, light and very practical if you do a lot of research on the internet, this thing can help you. Also for blogging, social networks or streaming it is amazing. Battery life is ok.<br/>Happy to have it!
This has been great for web surfing, emails, and photos. It is so fast, lightweight, and has a super display. And unlike my regular pc's. I don't have to spend time running anti virus software and downloading updates constantly. This is a great product and I only wish I had gotten one sooner. Toshiba really put a nice package together and the screen size is perfect.
Excellent. Screen is very nice. The computer is more than fast enough for a moderately patient human being.<br/><br/>I ran Ubuntu via Crouton on this but personally didn't need it that badly so I deleted it. I find Chrome OS does the job for me.<br/><br/>It might be worth more like 300 but it's a great computer overall and so far I haven't had any problems.
Excellent device, it's a pleasure to work on it, really.<br/>Special awards for the screen quality and the sound quality.<br/>For European potential buyers: I've received the device after few days from US in Italy, the only thing you have to do is to buy an European cable instead of the US one supplied with the device.
What  more  can  I say,  just  get  this  one....
Delivered on time and is a fantastic machine!
I love this thing. I've used Mac computers for the last few years, but this does everything I need for a fraction of the cost. The speakers are great for watching a movie on Netflix. My only complaint is that I can't plug my iPhone into it to dump pictures. Totally worth the money!
It surpassed my expectations. If you are accustomed to Android you will get used to it in no time and. In my case i am able to do everything that i used to on my older Microsoft laptop. There are improvements to be made but it is definitely worth while and good value for money.
I purchased this for my son as his Toshiba satellite laptop is almost gone - had it over 5 years, so it lasted in my eyes. I was concerned about buying a Chromebook for him because he's just not into Google and does nothing in the cloud, but he assured me that he wanted it and understood that it is different than Windows 7. The decision wasn't that complicated considering that Windows 7 laptops are hard to find at a decent price, Windows 8 is not good and Windows 10 is already having many issues from what I have read.<br/><br/>I set it up for him with a Google account and registered with Toshiba and then checked it out for myself. I love it, but then I use many Google apps and do plenty in the cloud. He hasn't touched it yet - been close to a week - and seems apprehensive about the whole Chromebook thing. I love it so much that he's running out of time to claim it. Not sure what he's worried about, but if he doesn't claim it in the next few days, it's mine, and if he does pick it up, I'm going to purchase one for myself. To be specific, I'd purchase this Toshiba. It's like the best of low-end laptops and the price can't be beat for what you get.<br/><br/>UPDATE on August 21, 2015:<br/><br/>So my son claimed it and loves it, except for one issue. A main purpose of this Chromebook for him is to watch WWE videos, like Summer Slam etc... with his WWE subscription. At first the fullscreen button only made the video move to the left corner and the rest of the screen was black. I updated the Chrome OS easily, restarted, and then it showed a real fullscreen. This only lasted a minute though, and then it became almost fullscreen, with toolbar on top and apps on the bottom of the screen. This is much better than the small screen on the left before the update, but I need to make it real fullscreen. I did contact WWE via the website on the issue, but haven't heard back yet. I figure it could be WWE in Chrome that's the issue. Still hunting for information and a fix and will update if I manage to fix the issue.
This is my first Chromebook.  After reading about them for some years, I finally decided to take the plunge and buy one.  I wanted one with 4 GB so I'd have enough memory for my many tabs I keep open at once (10-20 tabs).  I must say, after 72 hours, I'm totally impressed with the overall package that Toshiba and Google put together:<br/><br/>+ The screen is simply gorgeous - no two ways about it. I had to adjust the screen resolution for my aging eyes, but it's still very sharp and clear.<br/>+ The Toshiba Chromebook 2 uses premium Skullcandy speakers.  This is the second time I've used Skullcandy, and I'm always impressed by the depth of bass.<br/>+ The case is looks like aluminum, but it actually plastic...although no one could tell from a distance.<br/>+ The benefits of plastic case means no finger print smudges, or accidental scratches<br/>+ You get an extra 100 GB added to your Google Drive account -- for 2 years.  (Worth about $48, at time of publishing this.)<br/>+ Keyboard is excellent<br/>+ Intel Celeron chip in the Toshiba is snappy, and keeps up with my everyday surfing. (Although it's clearly not meant for heavy duty processing.)<br/><br/>- Keyboard is not lit<br/>- Setting up a printer on the Chromebook is a drag, and requires you to either have a newer printer that supports Google's cloud print, or you need another Windows PC or Mac,  logged onto Chrome at all times, so your Chromebook can print through them.  (Not ideal, but workable.)<br/>- No media controls built into the keyboard (i.e., play, pause, skip, etc...)<br/>- Weak parental controls.  You can create a "supervised" account, but you can't block inappropriate web sites, without going to the Chrome apps store for add ons.<br/><br/>By now, you must know that Chromebooks don't run MS Office natively, but you can always run Office 365 in the browser.  Office 365 gets you web versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, etc....  Here's the technical rub: Office 365 online doesn't allow you to point to Google Drive online --  or vice-versa, so the two cloud file systems end up separate.  On the other hand, Google Drive natively supports working with MS Office files that were uploaded to Google Drive (from another PC).  Also, Google Drive let's you export to MS office or PDF format, but you need to have confidence in Google lo keep your files safe in the native Google Docs format.  Plus Google offers you an excellent way to archive all your Google data, if you prefer to have a backup  copy of your own data. ( https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3024190?hl=en )<br/><br/>And that gets to my final reason, why I gave the Chromebook 5 stars.  Google does such a good job anticipating the user's experience, that the device is wonderfully intuitive -- more so that Mac, Windows, Linux, Android, or iOS.  (I know, I own all of these operating systems.)  But first you have to wean yourself off your desktop apps.<br/><br/>=======Review Update:========<br/>6 months later and you might think I could point out some flaws.  Guess what?  After 6 months, I still rate this as a 5 star product that works great.  Of all my computers in the house (and I have every major flavor), this Toshiba Chromebook is the most pleasant to use because it's so trouble free.  Battery life is so good I never think to charge it, except at night, after a day of on-and-off use.  If you've bought into the idea of having your data and apps in the cloud, this is the device for you.
I have had the 4GB IPS HD version of this laptop for about 9 months, and it is my go-to machine when I am at the house, and it makes an excellent travel machine.<br/><br/>Here is how I use it:<br/>- About 70% of what I do can be done in a browser, and since I use Chrome on my Windows and Linux machines, this Chromebook works perfectly for all of that.  It boots up in seconds, keeps itself updated, runs for 8 hours between charges, and just flat out works.<br/>- I have a Windows laptop for work.  It is about twice the weight of this Toshiba Chromebook, so I often leave that laptop running at home, and use Chrome Remote Desktop (CRD) to remote into it from the road so I can access it through the Chromebook.  CRD works really well if you have fast internet connections on both ends, and it is perfectly usable remotely with little to no delay.<br/>- Watching Netflix and movies is an absolute joy with this Toshiba Chromebook.  The screen is the best feature of the unit and it really excels for watching media.  The speakers fire up through the keyboard, and they sound OK as far as laptop speakers are concerned.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>- Screen on the HD IPS Model - among the best screens I've ever seen on a laptop at any price<br/>- Nice looking and lightweight laptop that is an excellent value<br/>- Fast boot-up<br/>- 8 hours of battery life, charges fairly fast<br/><br/>Cons<br/>- Is "plasticky"<br/>- Not the fastest most capable Chromebook, but works just fine for most of what I need<br/>- Using Bluetooth for audio results in some audio drops - I think this has to do with the limited power of the processor used in the Toshiba<br/><br/>All-in-all, this is a great laptop.  If you can do with a smaller screen, the new Asus Chromebook Flip is probably better for less cost, but for a 13 inch Chromebook, the Toshiba is an excellent value.  The screen alone makes this attractive for most uses.
To begin this review, I want to say that I am an avid Windows user.  I am also a gamer who does development in my spare time.  I wanted to change my computer habits up, why use a computer with a massive power draw to browse the web.<br/><br/>The perks for this:<br/>- The price - its price is low, and I can't complain.  I was initially looking at standard low end Windows laptops for $500, so this was a nice bonus.<br/>- The specs - ok, so this is where I was freaking out a bit.  I am coming from a laptop with a Gen 5 i7 with 24gb of memory and a SSD.  When I saw that this had a celeron processor on it, I was ready to skip it up, but a friend told me I should try it first and return it if I can't handle it.  This chromebook boots up faster than my gaming rig, it loads webpages faster, and it can handle so much being thrown at it.  I have yet to have ANY problems with the processing.  I had a movie streaming while I was browsing facebook, with about 12 tabs mind you, and no slow down.<br/>- The battery life - I think the articles I read said it lasts 8 hours.  Well, that is 8 hours of straight movies as far as I can tell because I have had it going for a day and a half without any problems.  With my gaming rig, I have to keep it plugged in all of the time, and the battery lasts about 3 hours with movies (not games).  To put this in perspective, this hasn't been plugged in all day and it says 47% 4:23 left.  And that is hours not minutes haha.<br/>- The screen - The screen on this laptop is crystal clear, it good on the eyes (I don't have to strain) and view angles are not a problem.  This screen rocks for watching movies.  There are buttons on the laptop which change the brightness, which are NOT function keys.<br/>- The touch pad gesture controls - This was a surprise to me.  I didn't realize this was even a thing, but I figured I would need to connect a mouse for browsing, as I hate the touchpad scroll bars.  However, with this laptop, if you take two fingers, and drag them down side by side, it scrolls the page up or down.  If you go left to right, it goes forward or backwards.  I find that I am using this way more than I thought I would.<br/>- Battery Life again - I turned down the screen brightness when I mentioned it earlier, now the battery life says 46% 5:45 left.  Just wanted to point out the sheer amount of time difference we are talking here.<br/>- Speakers - The speakers are hidden under the keyboard, so you will have trouble finding them, but turn this thing up to max and put it in a large room, and you won't have any trouble hearing it from the other side.  I have used it to let a large room of people listen to a song before with no problems.  A 12x12 room like a bedroom will not even push it.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- It isn't Windows - I have to get this out of the way, because most of the problem I had coming to this was because I am used to windows.  I will explain the differences real quick:<br/>1. There are missing keys on the keyboard.  The CAP locks key is gone, replaced by the search button (which essentially replaces the windows key as the start menu key).  The delete key is missing, in this case replaced with a power button.  There is no function keys, to access them, you have to hit the search key and a number.<br/>2.  There is only one mouse button, but there is a right and left click.  The button when pressed alone, is pressing the left mouse button.  To press the right mouse button, you have to use two fingers and tap the mouse pad.  This is mitigated because of how the mouse gestures work, it works real nicely with it.<br/>3.  There is NO start menu, instead you press the search key (or click the search icon) and something like OK Google shows up, with the tiles and everything.  It just has a list of the most commonly used icons under it and one to the right which says all apps.  You can click that to access your apps.<br/>4.  Local Storage isn't really a big thing.  This was something I really worried about because I needed local storage for some things.  The 16GB of storage this thing has actually is plenty for most everything I do.  For the most part, I am finding the Google Drive usage to be very nice.  For the things I need locally, I created a folder under my downloads folder and just drag it all in there.  That and it does let you use an external or thumb drive for anything seriously large.<br/>5.  NO GAMING.  Ok, so this is a slight exaggeration, it does have gaming, but not nearly as much as windows.  For instance, I was running a Nintendo emulator on here the other day with no problems.<br/>6.  Brightness.  From the few times I have used this laptop outside, the sun made it difficult to see.  It wasn't impossible, but I wouldn't make it a habit without some shade.  (On my porch was fine, but out in the yard was not)<br/>7.  Everything is a web app.  This is only a problem if you do not like the interwebs.  You can set apps to load as windows programs (like the calculator), but for the most part everything just opens as a tab in the browser.<br/><br/>I hope this helps, I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't hardcore game, and even then, I would recommend it on top of a gaming rig to save money.
I'll start off by saying that I did not purchase this Chromebook from Amazon but a major "big box" store. It makes little difference, so hopefully that won't detract from my review.<br/><br/>If you know what Chromebooks are all about, this is THE Chromebook to have. Currently it is the ONLY model on the market with a full 1080p AND IPS display (with the exception of the Pixel which costs $1000). It's just icing on the cake that it has 4GB instead of 2GB of RAM.<br/><br/>Why do you want an IPS and/or HD display? Many reasons, the main two of which being clarity and efficiency. On a small screen text is already hard enough to read; what makes it worse is a low pixel density/low-res screen. There's nothing worse than having eye fatigue after only 30 minutes. Oh, and let's not forget about IPS technology; it's truly something you have to experience to appreciate. The biggest benefit of an IPS display is the seemingly endless viewing angle. Have you ever noticed how washed out and crummy a laptop screen looks unless it's at the perfect angle? IPS fixes this issue and then some.<br/><br/>Yes, being 1080p, everything on this Chromebook will look smaller. However, zoom fixes this minor issue; and when it is zoomed in, the quality is retained.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about efficiency. Not only do you have the benefit of a much clearer/easier to use screen, it also lends itself to much longer battery life. The screen on this Chromebook allows it to run for hours on end because it's so much more efficient than the garbage screens on other models. This also means less heat being generated from the screen which equates to better overall usability.<br/><br/>Some years ago I purchased an Acer Chromebook and promptly returned it because it felt so cheap and I could do everything I wanted to, for the same price, with a Nexus 7 tablet. Fast forward a few years and I decide it's time for a legitimate mobile computer solution. I initially purchased a slightly larger HP model and promptly returned it after only using it a few hours. The difference the screen makes...it's just unreal.<br/><br/>Lastly, a tip for those who are complaining/concerned about the touch/track pad. Yes, it does have an odd, almost "studded", texture. It takes some getting used to but there is a solution for those willing to do some light modding. On my particular Chromebook I decided to cover the touch pad with a universal screen protector designed for a smartphone; the kind you have to cut yourself. Using a marker and an xacto knife I was able to cut the shape out and adhere the screen protector to the pad. You would not believe the difference this makes, and for next to no cost at that!<br/><br/>This Chromebook is one of the best purchases I've ever made.
My daughter loves having a computer! It was her favorite birthday present. Second favorite was 5th edition Monster Manual.<br/><br/>My daughter (age 7) loves it with the pink case cover. We do a little programming like Logo, Python, and Scratch which are all available inside the web browser. She has other websites like disney monster inc monster creator and gonoodle, etc. We can sit on the couch next to each other and "do computer stuff" before bed. I wanted to teach her programming early on (I started programming maybe around 8 or 9?) and so that rules out tablets (she has an Nambi and iphone 4 already.) She could already build simple snap circuits on her own before turning 5. There is so much great stuff out there now...<br/><br/>The screen is pretty awesome! In fact, it is better than my pre-retina Macbook I am typing this on (except mine has a matte display!)<br/><br/>I am using the managed account feature. It works ok -- but it is obvious that this is a secondary concern for Google. You can't install Chrome apps, and has other annoying limitations.<br/><br/>I gave it 4 stars because the left shift key sticks sometimes. Do I really want to go through the hassle?<br/><br/>And the build quality is a step down from Apple products (obviously the price is too!) It doesn't interoperate fully in the Apple world (Apple TV airplay, iphone, ...) It is a bit heafty for what limited computing platform. Yes, yes, it is at a low price point... but it is hard to love anything like this for 5 stars when it is next to the new 12" MacBook (which is 6.6x as expensive, everything considered YIKES!).<br/><br/>In the end it is a good (albeit somewhat pricey) solution for a youngster. An Apple solution would be at least twice as much and outside my budget.<br/><br/>We use these at work a lot because they are one of the most secure laptops on the market right now. So if you don't want to get infected with malware you might want to give a Chromebook a try as well.
As of April 2015, this Chromebook is the one to get. I upgraded from a HP Chromebook 11 so some of my review will compare/contrast the HP 11 and Toshiba CB2.<br/><br/>I'll start with the cons because there are so few:<br/>1) The processor is slow. There's no denying it, the processor is "good enough" but still slow. I experienced a lot of stutter and lag. It's not unbearable though.... this Celeron is much better than the original 1st gen HP Chromebook 11's Exynos processor.<br/>2) Texture of the lid - this is very preferential but I would have preferred a higher end looking laptop case. It's not bad though, it's such a minor gripe.<br/><br/>Now for the pros:<br/>1) 1080p IPS Display - This is the main attraction, and the star of the show. The colors are amazing and the extra pixels means lots of screen real estate. Love it.<br/>2) Battery Life is great. Maybe my standards are very low because the HP Chromebook 11 seemed to run out of juice really quickly.<br/>3) Keyboard is excellent.<br/>4) Touchpad is also excellent.<br/><br/>When you look at chromebooks, every single one makes a pretty major compromise... the Asus Chromebook 13 is almost perfect but the screen is horrible. HP Chromebook 11 was almost perfect, but the processor was the worst and battery life was terrible. Acer models have great internals but the aesthetics are lacking and the screen is bad. The only chromebook with no compromises is the Pixel but that's $1k.<br/><br/>If you're on the fence, buy this right now. This is the way to go.... just don't expect the processor to be as fast as your high end gaming desktop.... the processor is designed to sip on battery power and generate as little heat as possible. The fanless design is so amazing. Buy this now.
Let me start by saying you need to do your research when buying a chromebook so you know what it is. I did a lot before getting this and this review will be of this chromebook, not what a chromebook can and cannot do.<br/><br/>First off, it shipped and arrived on time wit no issues in the packaging.<br/><br/>This is my first chromebook and it replaced an old MacBook Pro that was getting way too slow and old for me to use. (I'll try not to compare the 2 too much). I am a college student and this is my stand alone computer. So far, after about 4 days of use, I love this thing. The build seems strongs and is virtually weightless. The keyboard is well laid out and is easy to type on. So far I enjoy the function buttons across the top and I find the search key is a nice replacement to a caps lock key (No caps lock key). The trackpad is nice but when looking straight down at it, it looks like there is more space between the left side of it than the right in regards to the palm rests. Not sure if it's only on my machine or on every one. However this does not affect the function and unless staring at it isn't noticeable.<br/><br/>The screen on this is very good. The colors are crisp and viewing angles are good, not the greatest, but better than most low cost computers. The sound by Skullcandy is quite impressive. It's very loud with some bass, but how much bass do you want in your computer speakers. The chromebook starts up very quickly and runs websites flawlessly. I browse facebook, amazon, and have a youtube video playing and theres no lag.<br/>I uploaded all my iTunes to google play and have a Toshiba 500GB hard drive that works nicely with this so I can store documents, and watch movies and other media offline. I love that there is a full HDMI plug for this, rather than the mini.<br/><br/>Overall I am very satisfied with this chromebook.
The Toshiba Chromebook 2 (full HD) has made significant improvements over the original chromebook.  The trackpad is responsive and feels more solid, while the older one was hollow sounding.  The keyboard is pretty good as well; though it’s not backlit, there is good contrast between the white lettering and the black keys.  Since the letters reflect the light from the screen, it has made it practical to make out the keyboard in the dark without much issue.  The screen is great overall (you’re going to have to tinker with the display settings to get the display to a normal size) with vivid colors, but dark scenes in videos are a bit darker than I’d like, though I think this is a relatively common issue with IPS displays.  I can make out details better on my 720p TV than my chromebook in those kind of scenes, though it’s not terrible on the chromebook.  Performance is good with generally smooth web browsing, scrolling, and video playback, though you do get a bit of lag at times.  I got a google Octane score of 8350. I’ve been impressed with how well screen casting works with the chromecast.  I haven’t used it too much, but videos have played smoothly so far, whereas my core i3 laptop would produce a choppy video and sound like it was going to have a heart attack.  Battery life is decent but not quite as good as advertised.  I haven’t done a scientific measurement on it but it seems to be getting about 6-7 hours with mixed browsing and video watching with brightness somewhere around 65%.  The device does get a bit warm on my lap but not unbearably so. I would have liked it if the edges were rounded which would have made it somewhat more ergonomic, but that’s a minor issue.  Overall, I really like the device but it’s not quite perfect.  I think when Intel Cherry Trail chips hit the market and improve performance a tad and produce a bit more of a cooler running device with longer battery life, the updated version will hit nearly every mark.
Just received this today, but I'll give my first impressions. Assuming you're sold on Chrome OS, it's a decent Chromebook. The screen looks great . . . others have noted that the 1080p resolution on a 13.3" display means small type and I would concur with that. I was able to change the defaults for web viewing to larger type so other than the type within Chrome itself, it's fine. The processor appears to be zippy enough to handle the basic Chrome OS tasks. The build quality is cheap, but not unreasonably so. It's plastic, but it looks decent and feel OK. It's not a MacBook Air certainly, but it's also not $1000+. The trackpad is decently responsive and big enough. I find the clicking action on it slightly clumsy, but it works.<br/><br/>As a basis of comparison, this computer replaces an HP Stream 13 that I bought a couple of weeks ago for about the same price, but immediately returned. I was hoping to get a Chromebook type of experience with the added benefit of being able to load MS Office onto the machine. But I ran into all kinds of problems just trying to set the thing up, so back it went. I would also rate that build quality on that a few notches below this -- the keyboard was super cheap, and the trackpad was barely functional. So if you're looking at that as an alternative, assuming you can get along without Windows OS, I'd definitely get this.<br/><br/>I've also had a Chromebox as my home desktop for the past three years or so, and I don't think that there's any question that Chrome OS is a superior operating system as compared to Windows, assuming again that you don't need to install any native Windows apps. For myself, I have remote access to my Windows computer at work, so there's nothing that I need installed native except a browser. My Chromebox has been lightning fast since day one, has never had any malware, virus, or other issues even with zero time, effort or money spent protecting it, and it works better now three years later than it did when I bought it. So I'm sold on Chrome OS, and the Toshiba looks like a decent laptop version of what I've been using at home.
As a seasoned IT veteran I have to say, there appear to be quality control issues with these otherwise amazing Chrombooks.<br/><br/>I ordered one a few days ago, paid a whole six bucks for overnight shipping, and it got here in just over 12 hours.  Amazing.  The device is an unparalleled value for the price - the perfect Chromebook for anyone who doesn't need a specific application that's only available in one OS market.<br/><br/>This is the best screen, weight, size, price, and the fastest x86 linux/crouton-capable fan-less processor currently available.  No vents or obstructions on the top, back, front or bottom.  Build quality is far superior to the Samsung Chromebook 1.  It's all soldered on and solid state and LED backlit, so it should last a lifetime.  I would take this over a $1000 macbook air any day of the week.<br/><br/>My only issue is a repetitive quality control issue with the trackpad.  The one that came quickly had a bubble in the bottom.  The replacement that came almost as quickly had a similar trackpad issue where it wasn't adhered all the way, and took way too much effort to click, and you could see underneath it from an angle, when it's normally supposed to be recessed.<br/><br/>Amazon customer service, who I've only had to call twice in 10 years and 100 orders, has been amazing as always.  Toshiba customer service has been disappointing.  I sent them pictures and an apologetic email saying I'm sorry for the returns but I hope to use this device for my everyday work for the next 3-5 years but just want one that's assembled correctly.<br/><br/>I will update this as things progress, but if you can get your hands on one and see that it's assembled correctly, GET IT.
This is my third chromebook and I have to admit that is the best one I've ever had. The first one was the samsung 11.6 inches x303 bought a couple of years ago. I liked it was very portable but the screen was really poor. Last year in november I bought a Hp 11 arm based 1 generation with an Ips screen. Well when I turned it on first time I was absolutely impressed by the screen, the desigh and the quality of sound, and the real reactive keyboard. Unfortunately performance and trackpad were a little bit miserable, but anyway a good device.<br/>Now since a couple of days I've got this Toshiba from Amazon paid only 269 dollars thanks to black friday and I have to say that is really great. The screen is amazing same quality of the IPS screen on HP chromebook 11 but in a way much better thanks to its 13.3." screen, The sound is fantastic, really amazing in a such cheap notebook. Keyboard and trackpad are absolutely fully responsive and writing is a real pleasure. For what can I see battery with a 75% brightness is able to constantly get almost 8 hours and for me is fully enough.<br/>About the performance I must say that I'm very satisfied too, I read many critics about this cpu but for me is ok, I have maximum 8 tabs open with youtube and spotify and general performance is really good. I don't need to have 20 tabs open and I really don't understand why is so necessary for someone to have so many tabs open in a computer.<br/>Right now I have 36% battery left and still almost 4 hours power. What can I say more, well only buy this notebook because is really special and setting is a real piece of cake. Last but not least thing is the 1TB free space on Google drive that I immediately redeemed.
For me the best chromebook on the market.
Does what it was made for, performs within its intended usage which is a general purpose internet browsing machine capable of multimedia capabilities as well.<br/><br/>Good build quality, excellent display and keyboard makes this laptop a pleasure to use.
Love the chrome book!! The delivery was on time. I chose 1 day shipping. The packaging was fine no issues. For the people who are on the fence. Remember no matter what you buy, do your research. I did research for 6 months, just so I could understand what I was buying. The chrome store has a lot to offer. And yes there are a lot of free apps. Understand your needs and what you expect for the price you are willing to pay for a device. Electronics these days are like investments. I am a google fan and understand chrome. I have a nexus 7 and an android phone. Not a windows fan at all.  Windows you buy the anti-virus on a continuous basis. Apple eeh!! Don't get me wrong if you are an artist, creative, do photography, on a level that you need what it has to offer,that's cool. However, I do not see the justification of buying apple products for that price if all I am doing is surfing the net,checking e-mails. ( once you buy the mac, then you buy the iphone and or the ipad $$$ ..ijs) Check out omg chrome. That site breaks the chrome books down. Once you decide on that certain model research it. The ones complaining seem to be ones who do not understand chrome or not open to trying something different, or just genuine issues. Check your pros and cons for each system windows,chrome,apple and see what works for you. Don't forget do your own research. Any problems I will update.<br/><br/>Pros -packaging,display, on time, no virus protection is needed, set up a breeze.battery time good<br/>Con - the font size was small. So I adjusted my resolution in my settings. Problem solved.
This laptop is definitely something interesting. I do love the overall design and look of the product, and it's relatively light. This definitely reminds me the minimalist design of a macbook. The display is wonderful and the resolution cannot be beaten at this price range. However, if you are looking for performance, I would suggest looking into the 2015 models. To be blunt, the performance is quite poor. Typing in the search bar generates lag for the text. You can see text trail behind even in word documents especially if you are a fast typist. Other reviews have stated you can watch Youtube vidoes in 1080p, yet I am having trouble watching in 720p.<br/><br/>Web pages have a stutter when you load them. When exiting from full screen Youtube videos, there's a bit of lag before you can fully exit out. Ultimately, I cannot even recommend this for a college student because there is some performance issues that are difficult to overlook. Many people stated that the performance is fine, but I find it to be problematic. I cannot imagine being too productive on this laptop considering how slow sometimes the web pages load.  If you are going to purchase this, do not expect much out of the performance. There are newer models that would most likely offer better performance.<br/><br/>Overall however, the price is essentially what you paid for so I cannot be too critical. Also the laptop clearly emphasizes other areas other than performance. The only thing fast about this laptop is the boot up time, and opening up Google Chrome. Once you start using Chrome however, is a different story.
This is the best laptop I have bought so far (I haven't owned a Macbook yet). I have a Mac mini for my productivity work and the Chromebook 2 for web surfing and light use on the go. For under $300 you get:<br/>-a blazing fast laptop that switches on and off in under 7 seconds.<br/>-an ideal device for web browsing<br/>-a FHD screen<br/>-Amazing speakers<br/>-10 hour usage from 1 charge<br/><br/>Now I'm pretty sure most people have covered the pro's, con's and features, I'm going to narrow down my review into the suggested improvements (Chromebook 3) for what I consider to be the best laptop in the market after the Macbook:<br/>1. Make it a little sturdier, I know for the price you can't complain, and perhaps sturdy means more weight for this size, but the screen does feel a little flimsy when I try to open it, it bends, that's not a good sign.<br/>2. There should be a little area on the lower bottom part where the screen can be lifted when it's closed (like the Macbook), it's inconvenient to try to lift your laptop's screen with your fingernail.<br/>3. Performance is good, nevertheless I do notice some choppiness while scrolling, perhaps an intel processor that has a better integrated GPU like the i3's models that end with the number 7 would work.<br/><br/>I would gladly pay up to $400 for the next Toshiba chromebook 3 if in fact they improve the above. I don't think I can go back to Window's laptops after using the chromebook and got used to it's sheer speed.
Have been using this Chromebook for about one month now and took it with me on travels.<br/>The Good:<br/>- Boots in seconds. You turn it on, and it's ready to rock! Connects to Wifi and you get to surf the net with ease<br/>- Nice screen. No complaint there. Good resolution.<br/>- Good sound, especially with headphones.<br/>- Good battery life. I have not tracked but it is good enough that I never worry about it.<br/>- The price: for just over $200 you get a lot. Really hard to beat !<br/>- Weight: It is light very light. I carry it everywhere.<br/><br/>The Good to know<br/>- This is really just for internet and other Google apps use. If you are big into Google Drive (Docs, etc) you will enjoy it. It is not meant to be used as an offline computer. Without Wifi you have pretty much nothing. I personally get confused when I download something and try to find it later..<br/>- Brightness and other settings need to be changed at every boot (It defaults to medium while I like it full)<br/><br/>The bad (really bad)<br/>- The mouse trackpad is pretty much useless. It is sluggish, slow, non responsive, and I have used countless laptops in my life. This computer should never be used without an external mouse. Once you plug a mouse it works like a charm. I changed the mouse track speed and that changed nothing. They really cut corner on that one. I would give this product almost 5 stars if it was not for this issue which challenges the idea of being portable.
I have long been skeptical of Chromebooks, but I finally took time to research them and the Chrome OS. After reviewing and testing a few, I have to say that this Toshiba Chromebook 2 was by far FOR THE PRICE was the best one. So I decided to order one which was priced at $299 which came with a mouse, 16GB thumb drive and carrying case. When I opened it up and turned on, it was more than what I was expecting. The most notable features: IPS HD 13" Screen and SkullCandy Sound. Its quick and easy to connect due to the Chrome OS. All of my bluetooth devices (LG Bluetooth Headset, Bose SoundLink II, Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard) connected without any issues.<br/><br/>This is a perfect secondary device, and could even be a adequate primary system, if you are not reliant upon premium applications (Adobe Products, Microsoft Visio or Project, etc.). If you use these types of premium products, but only perform basic functions - there are free applications on Googles Store that are comparable. However, I still use my MacBook Pro for my primary processing power. Beyond that, Chrome OS contains your standard Microsoft compatible office productivity applications (Google Docs, Sheets and Slides, etc.). In essence this is a "better" tablet, light and essentially a full functioning laptop.<br/><br/>If you are on the fence with a Chromebook, you won't be wasting money on this gem. Small investment and significant return!
My old Windows computer crashed probably for the last time,so I got this for me and my wife to use.It boots instantly,crystal clear display adequate sound,etc.It's not a bells-and-whistles model but it suits our needs.
Honestly, this laptop is amazing. For $300, this is one of the most affordable Full-HD IPS display on the market. Acer makes cheaper ones, but they're hideously white. I can't say enough how gorgeous the screen quality is.<br/><br/>-The text is crisp and readable, even tiny text is easy to read. The 1080p resolution is nice, though some of the menu text is small like people say. I actually bumped the resolution down to 1536x864 to make text and menus larger and the screen still looks great at the lower resolution and I can't tell the difference between it and the 1080. The viewing angles are great as well.<br/>-The speakers can get pretty loud.<br/>-The keyboard is quiet and responsive.<br/>-The trackpad is sensitive and feels good to the touch.<br/>-The only thing I could say is that I wish it was aluminum but then the price point would certainly be higher, though the metallic plastic shell still looks and feels nice. I hope Toshiba builds a high-end model after this one with aluminum shell and maybe 8GB RAM for more money because I'd definitely buy it.<br/>-The battery life is also phenomenal.<br/>-The laptop is also super light.<br/>-The fanless design is a nice addition because I hate hearing the whir of a noisy fan. The bottom towards the screen gets slightly warm with intense usage but not hot in any way.<br/><br/>Definitely a satisfied customer here.
Good performance and sharp screen
This does everything I need.<br/><br/>I needed a lightweight machine that starts fast and works fast. It has excellent battery life and the display is GORGEOUS. Easily the best display of any laptop I've ever owned. Using a Chromebook after having a traditional laptop does take a little adjustment, but now I don't think I'll go back unless I start feeling the need to run heavy-duty programs like Photoshop etc-- which I don't really anticipate. I haven't asked this little guy to multitask in a way it hasn't been capable of yet, and all my files were pretty much already on my google drive so the transition was as easy as signing in. If you're mostly just using a computer for internet browsing, music, youtube vids, etc, this is perfect.<br/>The keyboard is very comfortable to type on. Touchpad has been responsive, and you have the ability to adjust speed if you prefer it to be a little more or less squirrley than the default setting. Charges quickly. Has bluetooth, WiFi access is quick and strong. The sound output is pretty solid from something that apparently comes from behind the keyboard! I'm not an audio snob, but I am a musician and I'm happy with what I'm hearing. Also, it is super lightweight.<br/><br/>No Skype, and I wish I could adjust the brightness so it's not quite so bright when I use it at nighttime but those are pretty minor complaints.
Solid product.  I'll list my own pros and cons.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Incredible battery life (8 hours if streaming video, and I've gotten 11 hours web browsing and working in google docs with the screen turned low.<br/>Very light weight.  I would compare weight directly to an older mac air.<br/>Durability.  I'm impressed by the hardware.  I have dropped this from around knee height and no issues.<br/>Keyboard feedback and feel:  I really like the way this types, the layout of the keyboard (does not feel narrow like many 13" 'books) and quick keys.<br/>Screen.  Graphics are plenty good and the colors pop.<br/>Memory:  onboard 16gb and 128gb can be added with a cheap SD card addition.  Drive also gives you another 100GB free storage.<br/>Processor:  I have been able to overwhelm it with HD video from netflix, but only when trying to chromecast quickly.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The screen is highly reflective - if there is a light at any angle it reflects.  The larger Chromebooks have antiglare screens.<br/>The charger cable and interface.  The plug in does not feel secure - it doesn't snap in and has a bit of wiggle to it.<br/>Keyboard is not backlit.<br/><br/>Just weird:  The Toshiba and Chome logos are backwards - every person I know who I've handed my chromebook to, try to open in the wrong way because of their orientation.
Update<br/>The Laptop came back from Toshiba repair with a note claiming the screen was replaced with a new one - and it had a vertical<br/>line of dead pixels when I took it out of the box. After about 45 minutes on the phone, Toshiba support told me to once again<br/>use their website to order an shipping box, to send it for a 2nd round of repairs. I did - and it took Toshiba exactly 1 week to just<br/>START shipping me the box (FedEx says they just received notice a package WILL be shipped). Given Toshiba turn-around time, I will have the Laptop repaired - MAYBE, if Toshiba manages to fix it this time - by the end of the month.<br/><br/>So in summary<br/>1. LAptop fails after 5 months<br/>2. It takes Toshiba about 1 Months to fix it under Warranty, and I have to pay $30 and be at home on a weekday  to sign for an empty<br/>  shipping box (Toshiba does not even allow me to ask FedEx to hold it at their office for pickup)<br/>3. The laptop comes back from repair already broken - and in the same way the trouble started to begin with<br/>4. It takes another month for this 2nd round of repairs. I am spared the $30, but still ahve to be present to sign for the<br/>  empty box.<br/>5. Toshiba is not willing to extend the warranty of the machine to compensate me for the 2 months it was in the Toshiba<br/>  Repair cycles.<br/><br/>If this sounds like fun to you - go ahead, buy one of these.<br/><br/>The laptop itself is nice, but BE WARNED - the screen is VERY VERY flimsy, and even if you never drop the unit, the screen can be damaged internally by just normal handling. (Google for "Toshiba screen problems" etc. and you'll see how many results you get). When this happens - and it will - even if the Laptop is under warranty, Toshiba expects you to pay to ship it to their repair depot - and they tell you your cheapest, recommended option is to pay Toshiba $29 to get a prepaid shipping box.  So, expect to pay about 10% of the total cost to have an Under-warranty  laptop repaired, where damage is a  direct result of Toshiba's design choice to not give the screen any protection.<br/>Definitely my last Toshiba
My initial impression of this computer was fantastic. The only laptop I've had previous to this was bought three years ago (Lenovo B560 Series; not sold anymore) and just gave out. Wouldn't load anything. So when I got this nifty little Chromebook, I was very pleased with the quick loading times and immediate boot-up.<br/>However, in the days after first receiving it I noticed the major differences between buying an actual laptop and buying a Chromebook. What I (and a lot of other people) didn't realize is that, with a laptop that is solely web-based in its operation, you cannot download actual programs to this computer like you would a normal laptop. Everything you accomplish on this computer is through web-based applications and extensions provided by chrome and any affiliated partners who choose to provide their services through the Chrome store. Examples of this are Microsoft, which has a web-based app you can download and still create and share documents, spreadsheets, powerpoints and actually OneNote as well. However, you can't download iTunes (you need to switch any music you have in iTunes over to the Google Music Play which is tedious), and any other program cannot be saved to your "desktop" because, technically, your desktop is the equivalent to your Google account information. Anything saved on your computer is actually just saved to your Google Drive account.<br/>Everything functional about this computer is great. The keyboard is really comfortable, the sound (without headphones) is pretty decent thanks to Toshiba's and Chrome's sponsorship with Skullcandy. Speed is obviously much better than any memory-bogged laptop. Display is crystal clear, only downside is that the text is actually quite small on this computer but if you can get over that / adjust to it, there really isn't a problem with it.<br/>Overall it's a great little computer, just don't expect any programmers to be ecstatic about using it. You won't be able to download any "real" program on this computer. If that's an essential part to your computer-usage, this isn't the laptop for you. If you only really need it for internet based activities and note-taking like I do (about to become a sophomore in college) then go for it! For the price, and what I plan on using it for, it's a very reasonably priced and functional machine.
Build is acceptable. Processor could be a tad faster. Battery life is great. Screen is fantastic.<br/><br/>As long as you know what you are getting into with Chrome OS, you won't be disappointed with this.
It's my first Chromebook so I can't compare it with another Chromebook but compared to my Windows laptop (and every other sort of portable computing device I've ever used) it is awesome! Display, speed, keyboard...everything I expected! Very pleased with my purchase!
The Toshiba CB35-B3340 is an excellent Chromebook. Unfortunately for me one of its strongest attributes also points out a (at present anyway) weakness in Chrome OS. That weakness is that for a person with impaired eyesight at the native resolution of the screen the system fonts and the cursor are too small to see easily. To get around this limitation one must DECREASE the resolution and choose the large cursor. There are only two sizes for the cursor: Small and Large. At decreased resolution the cursor become HUGE. It is also irritating to have to decrease the resolution since the high resolution is an important selling point for this device. Nevertheless, in all other respects the Toshiba CB35-B3340 is spectacular and I do use it a lot. I can handle about 80% of the tasks that I would normally do with a PC. The remaining 20% are tasks like financial management (I use Quicken and QuickBooks) and database management (I use MS Access).  Otherwise, particularly with the availability now of Outlook.com for email, the unit performs very well and has become my "Go To Machine" for routine tasks on the web and email.<br/><br/>The other problem I mentioned above (the system fonts and the cursor) I am certain will eventually be fixed by Google. Until then that is just an irritating side show.<br/><br/>Bob Harris
So this is my first day of using this Chomebook. Here are a few things Id like to say about it.<br/><br/>THE GOOD:<br/>Screen resolution is sharp/crisp. Watching HD on this Chromebook is nice.<br/>Overall, it has lightweight/simplistic design. Easy to cart around.<br/>RAM + processor is keeping up with my multiple tabs, apps and docs.<br/>Skullcandy gives out clear and loud sound. I wasnt expecting the sound to be this nice.<br/><br/>THE BAD:<br/>Spacing on the keyboard is something I'll need to get used to.<br/>Keyboard is NOT backlit. Meaning a light needs to be on in dim or night time setting to see the keyboard.<br/>Trackpad is a single click design, meaning you must press ALT+click to right click, correct text and open new tabs.<br/>I am a little wary of the power cord, its very slim and a bit fragile feeling. I have to wonder if it wear down in time.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE:<br/>I enjoy the performance, portability and visual/audio features of this Chromebook. I am annoyed by the trackpad and the keyboard not being backlit but for the price, I'll live. The trackpad and keyboard are the only reasons this slim entertainment focused Chromebook doesn't get the full 5 stars. I don't regret this purchase.<br/><br/>Things you should know about Chromebook BEFORE purchase:<br/>Chromebooks currently cannot screen share w/ most devices without purchasing Chromecast or using Chrome Beta w/ dev channels.<br/>USB devices are limited to keyboard and mouse ONLY. USB audio devices, art tablet and the like will not work.<br/>Apps are limited. Play around in the Chromebook market before making the choice. You may find what you need by a different App Developer or you may not find it at all.
My first chromebook. I played with various chromebooks at BB. This absolutely had the best "form factor" (looks) out of the bunch. That, combined with the HD screen, and the 13 inch size (my fav) made this unit a no brainer. I ditched my old PC (after uploading my files to google drive), hooked this to my existing peripherals; then, set up double screens with my old monitor to make this my "desktop". Just unplug a few things to go mobile. I was already using google's ecosystem, so the transition was pretty easy from PC. Bought a cannon cloud/google drive ready printer, and was in business. I'm going run this setup for a while to see if I miss or need windows/mac os, before I decide if I want to go "full chrome" and insert a chromebox into my makeshift desktop; so I don't have to unplug things everyday when I disconnect my chromebook. It's so refreshing to not have to worry about viruses and drivers and other windows "stuff". I see where some others have had issues transitioning to chrome, but I found it seamless. Gamers and folks that run high powered, installed, software won't be happy with this, but for most of us, it's a great alternative to clunky windows. Getting back to the toshiba itself, the only negative I can think of is that it is slightly slow. It's on par with my old desktop, but nowhere near as fast as a modern desktop/ultrabook. Don't get me wrong, it's not like you're waiting on pages to load like you're on 1995 aol dialup lol, but it is slower than a macbook or ultrabook imo. I'm interested to see where manufacturers go with this platform, with core cpu's and whatnot. Overall I would buy it again today if something happened to it.
As I type this review I am staring into a BEAUTIFUL Full HD 1080p screen and clicking away on a springy and well laid out keyboard.  Track pad is spot-on and very easy to use straight out of the box.  If you are unfamiliar with the Chrome OS, look into it and see if you can handle a largely browser-based computing system.  Battery life is very good.  Not as good as a few other Chromebooks, but for the full HD display, and a beautiful bright screen, it's very impressive.  I won't go into tips and tricks and all the amazing things you can do with a Chromebook, but if you are looking for a cheap laptop for College (why I purchased this), you will be very satisfied with your purchase.  As long as you have an internet connection, there is little you can't do.  A lot is happening in the world of Cloud based computing, and soon there will be a vast market for cloud-run apps (photoshop, illustrator, flash, ect.), and when that market explodes, the need for a loud rocket ship sized laptop that has 750 TB of ram and enough memory to hold every picture ever taken will be dramatically increased.  Browser based computing with an emphasis on HTML 5 is where mobile computing is headed and with a Toshiba Chromebook 2 in full 1080p HD, you will be well equipped for whatever it is you need to do.
In my opinion this is the best Chromebook on the market right now. I've been using the Toshiba just over a month. It's my second Chromebook. I really enjoy my first, the Acer C720, but this fabulous Toshiba display and larger screen size makes it my go to laptop. While the Acer may be a tad faster the display is really lacking in comparison. I use a company Windows laptop for work since I have to, but the Chromebooks have been the best for leisure as they are lightweight, have no need for anti-virus protection and the boot-up time is literally seconds. They also can be used as productivity tools and now have the ability to save Google docs as Microsoft docs. There are even apps that allow you to download texts in PDF format, which I find very handy.<br/><br/>Pros of the Toshiba for me are:<br/>Gorgeous display.<br/>Fanless and silent.<br/>Nice-sounding, high volume speakers.<br/>Speedy enough - I have no need to open ten tabs or more on this simultaneously.<br/>Nice looking - I find the textured cover attractive.<br/>Good touchpad - the slight texture feels good to me and helps with grip.<br/>Movies and all sorts of videos look stunning with vivid colors.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>None with the Toshiba.<br/>Would like to see Google extend it's 1 terabyte drive storage offer to those who own multiple Chromebooks and also extend the free storage expiration date for each new Chromebook purchase. I could not redeem the new offer since I already had a Chromebook and the offers are only redeemable per Google account, not per number of devices. Google, be more accommodating to your small, dedicated group of Chromebook users!!!
Love it.  Everything I expected and more.  No waiting for start up, great screen clarity and sound.  Keyboard is comfortable and responsive. Recommend it to anyone who is considering a Chromebook.
i bought this back in February so needless to say i have had my share of use of it. first let me start with the pros. the design is wonderful, light weight and sturdy.  the screen is wonderful, sometimes i wish it was touchscreen but the gestures on the mouse pad work great.  battery life is wonderful, standby time is insane. i but this thing away form about 3 months because i moved. but when i turned it on it still have 78% battery left.<br/>the special offers that google throws your way can be wonderful too. just got 200 GB of storage for drive. started putting my movie collection on it. one of the really cool things is that the most recent update now allows the Chromebook to have the SD slot used at internal storage. for music or files.  this this has definitely become my primary laptop for day to day use.<br/>about the only con i can think of is that it is still relatively new. so if your not supper techy the options for programs and other apps is kinda limited to mobile app style.  but i feel that every few times i turn it on there are new things to look at so there is hope indeed.<br/>all in all with chrome support and and google docs, sheets, slides and drive you have a really nice computer.
This is my third Chromebook.  I previously owned a silver Samsung and black Samsung, going back a couple of generations.  All have worked fine, especially considering the price.  This one has the best screen and is the fastest, by far. The screen quality and speed easily justify the slightly higher price.<br/><br/>What has me most concerned about the Chromebook family of computers is Google's performance lately.  In recent months I've noticed Google Maps slowing to the point of being unusable.  Same with Google Search on occasion.  I have problems connecting with Google Mail and Google Drive lags and hangs up all the time.  What's going on?  I thought the problem might be with my router and internet speed but everything else, from Amazon to eBay, work perfectly fine.  Consequently, I've moved to Bing search and Mapquest and the performance is much better.  It's not the computer, or my connection.<br/><br/>I'm a huge Chromebook fan.  I'm disillusioned with Apple and I'd revert to using the Yellow Pages before I ever buy another Windows machine, but this recent trend has me worried.  Hopefully this is a temporary blip.<br/><br/>The computer gets five stars, I deducted one for the Google issue.
Really, all you need is Google! Screen color reproduction and viewing angles are amazing. No other Chromebook but the Google Pixel has a screen this good. And its a fraction of the price.
This was on sale for $269 when I bought it.  It was/is worth every penny (and then some)!  Fantastic display (really, really fantastic), very comfortable keyboard (something no 11.6 chromebook can boast; I tried a few of them before I got this one, and they all felt cramped and icky to a touch-typist like me), great battery life, 4GB of RAM so it doesn't get laggy with a bunch of windows open, fanless (despite which, it still runs plenty cool to sit on your lap, unlike my Macbook which will burn your legs), etc.  The only things I wish it had that it doesn't, are all things that would have added so much to the price that I probably would have not bought it -- such as an all aluminum case, a backlit keyboard, and a truly Mac-class trac-pad (this one works absolutely fine, but feels a little thick and clunky, for lack of a better term, when compared to my Macbook Pro).<br/><br/>Straight up, this is my new go-to laptop, so much so that I'm going to sell the $3k MacBook and just roll with this.  I can do everything in ChromeOS I would ever reasonably want to do (email, web, documents, ssh, etc), and if I ever come up with something I can't, I'll set this up to dual-boot to Linux.  Done.  Love it!
Works amazingly well if you know what you are getting into.  These work either as a web browser or as a Linux laptop with Crouton.  If you are expecting Windows or MacOS, look elsewhere.
Works very well, beautiful screen. However the case feels cheepish and due to the high resolution, some of the UI is difficult to see as too small. Some further tweaks to the OS needed.
Great laptop.  Good battery life, fast, easy to use, easy set up.  You have to get used to how chrome works, and some key strokes are different.  This is everything I expected and more!
For someone like me who needs a laptop that can work on simple web and word processing applications, this purchase was definitely a good one.  I won't go into the product specific details as I am not much of a spec expert when it comes to these things; but I read up on several reviews and the general gist I got was that even if the processor is not that powerful as in earlier models, the IPS screen and good battery life make it a good compromise.<br/><br/>I've had this chromebook for almost 2 months now and so far it has been a wonderful experience.  It may lag if you go to process-intensive applications, but for general web-browsing and typing it is great!  The screen quality is superb and I can stream Netflix and other providers with no drops in quality.<br/><br/>As I am primarily using this chromebook as my work/study portable laptop it fits perfectly in both my briefcase (with the cable and mouse) and with its fast boot and fanless design make it ideal for on-the-go types.  The keyboard is also sturdy and listening to music is surprisingly good.<br/><br/>As a first-time Chrome OS user I am taken and will definitely consider getting another chromebook in the future.
Great laptop ,everything i expected...fast ,high resolution , plenty of apps and love the extensions , with no worry of viruses and constant updates as in window pc,s. Great value !
Awesome mini labtop (i call it that). This chromebook works flawlessly and has an absolutely amazing screen. It is very crisp and clear. Super fast boot up (like 3 seconds) almost unreal and has worked without a hiccup. The style and apperance are of high quality and the raised dottted texture on the cover and back make more of a grippy surface instead of smooth and glossy. A very nice touch. Looks like an expenisive model but just under 4 bills (for the hd screen) which i definetly recommend is very affordable and i will never need anything that this little super computer can't do. The keyoard responds quickly and as far as the touch pad (mouse pad) is spot on and i think way better than the everyday computer or labtop. The way you can swipe between web pages or tabs is absolutely amazing and super fast. Way faster and easier for me to use than a regular mouse and keypad. This chromebook is user friendly and being google based syncs with my android phone perfectly and easily. Not sure what else i can say about this chromebook except that i love it and you will not be dissapointed in this purchase.
its reasonably well built, it is light, it has a decent keyboard, speakers are loud, webcam is functional. The main advantage of this particular chromebook is the full hd 1080 screen---unlike some other models this is an ips panel so the colors, viewing angles and display is razor sharp.<br/><br/>The major downside? The cpu?  Even with the 4 gig of memory model, this is JUST slow enough opening more than a few tabs to be really annoying. The trade off for this unit is better battery life..but compared to performance of a celeron acer version or i3 version,  its just slow to me.  Perhaps I was opening too many tabs, but 5 chrome tabs should not cause an obvious delay ....<br/><br/>I think future models of chromebooks are addressing this issue-but like many of the past, either you get a great display and slow cpu or a better CPU and a so-so display. This chromebook sadly repeats past mistakes, If they had just used a haswell celeron chip it would have been a total slam dunk.  But they went for a lower model broadwell chip and......it shows.
This Chromebook is incredible. I have had it now for 8 months, and I still love it. I considered spending the money for a Macbook, but I thought that since I am mainly using it for college, this should suffice, and worst case I can just buy a Macbook later. I will not be buying a Macbook because this provides an awesome experience for school at a fraction of the price.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-BEAUTIFUL Display<br/>-Fast startup and usage<br/>-Great and usable keyboard<br/>-Effective trackpad (you can swipe three fingers to switch tabs, and two fingers to go forward and back, which is extra useful)<br/>-Beautiful fullscreen Google Chrome experience<br/>-Great battery life (6 to 7 hours is a long time of use, and sometimes I get much longer times)<br/>-Quick to charge<br/>-Lightweight and nice looking asctetics<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Some programs don't work (as to be expected with Chromebooks), like a watered down Microsoft Word, etc...<br/><br/>BUY IT! For a little over $300, this ingenious machinery is truly worth it.
I love this little thing! Goes with me everywhere. It's the best value-purchase I made in some time.<br/><br/>Screen is beautiful. I have touchpad at full-sensitivity, but it's still not fast enough for me. Keyboard is more than awesome.<br/><br/>I do a lot of gmail, Asana, Shopify, Zendesk, Salesforce for work and I have all those tabs open without any problems. It "feels" like (honestly subjective) it uses the RAM much better than when I have the same tabs open in Chrome on my new work Dell laptop on Windows 7.<br/><br/>Build quality is not bad. When I went to BestBuy to try it out, I looked at the screws and they were loose. I thought it was because of overuse. Well, 2 screws started coming loose on the bottom after one week. Luckily, I noticed it immediately and tightened them all down.<br/><br/>For reference, I also have IPhone 6+, iPad mini2, and MacBook Pro 13" retina. And I'm VERY satisfied with this Chromebook. I'm looking forward to bit more video power and better touchpad on the next iteration.
I really love having a Chromebook, it's very light and it starts up quickly.  I wasn't sure if I could handle using a Chromebook, but found it easy to use.
I don't normally write reviews, but had to chime in and say that this is worth every penny. If you're looking for a Chromebook, this is the one to get.
Better then using any windows 8 devices by a mile, more fun then using a tablet.  Simple, fast, with a beautiful display. What more can you ask for?
It is very good!!!! I use it everyday for homework check it even has a place so you could plug in your flash drive and finish or start your report.
I'm lovin' this Chromebook.  The screen resolution is amazing and it is light and reasonably sturdy.  Easy to set up and reasonably quick to load.
After owning this for two months and using it almost every day, here's what you need to know from a picky web surfer:<br/><br/>- This thing lives in my living room and bedroom, and I baby it. Comments about the flimsy display bezel are correct; if you have to throw this thing around I can't imagine it lasting more than two years.<br/>- 1080p 60fps video on youtube does not play smoothly. 720p 60fps does most of the time. 1080p 30fps is fine.<br/>- Use the trackpad's tap-to-click and two finger scrolling. Don't try to use the button. Bonus: three finger tap-to-middle-click is default behavior.<br/>- Get the chrome extension called "Smart Zoom" -- allows Mac-like two-finger-tap-to-zoom behavior in a right click menu while chrome adds the feature by default (there's an open bug report / feature request on it).<br/>- You can do weird UI independent stuff with it by doing ctrl+shift++ and ctrl+shift+-
This laptop rocks!  By way of background, I use a relatively new Macbook Pro Retina Display, 13”, with Mavericks.  I bought this to loan to a friend.  I gotta tell you:  the resolution on this screen is nearly as good as Retina Display!  Wow!  Gorgeous!  And the keyboard is better than my expensive Macbook’s.<br/><br/>All in all, a magnificent machine.  Toshiba did an outstanding job.  Lightweight.  Elegant.  Nothing cheesy about it.<br/><br/>I had not used a Chromebook before.  I was pleasantly surprised.  If you can manage to do all your computer tasks without downloading software, this is the laptop for you.  There are zillions of apps you can add to this, and they’re all free of charge.  Compare that to buying a Windows or Apple laptop and then laying out $$$ for programs & apps.<br/><br/>Chromebook is fast.  Faster than my lightning-fast Macbook.<br/><br/>Perhaps best of all:  Toshiba has figured out how to make a superb touchpad.  Only Apple managed to do this, till now.  I repeat:  This has an excellent touchpad.  You don’t need a mouse.<br/><br/>And the price:  Ahhh!
Great display and it's no fuss and no muss. I mostly use it for Facebook and YouTube and it works perfectly. Battery life is great too.
I love this little machine. My only complaint so far is that I don't love the clicking part of the mousepad, but that is solved by tapping to click instead. Otherwise, it's outperformed my expectations.<br/><br/>One caveat is that I've never had a Chromebook before (just bulkier laptops that were made in 2012 or earlier), so there are some things about it that are appealing to me that aren't unique to it, such as its light weight, quick boot-up, and long battery life. That being said, I love the keyboard, screen, and sound quality, which from my research it looks like tend to be weaker in other Chromebooks or smaller laptops. I got this primarily for taking notes in class (and assumed I'd continue to use my older laptop as my primary computer), but I expect I'll be using it for lots of everyday tasks as well (it's so easy to carry around the house and it boots up so quickly)!
My personal computer is a Macbook but I needed something specifically for work. Our office uses Google products for everything (i.e. Drive, Gmail, Docs, etc.), and after doing a fair amount of research, this Chromebook seemed like it would meet my needs/standards at a decent price. Even though I bought this to be strictly a work computer, I find myself using it more and more as my default computer while my Macbook gathers dust. The more I use it and enjoy the speediness, the ability to multi-task, the sound quality and the screen quality--all in a lightweight package--the less I can understand why people are still paying $2000+ for a computer that needs to be replaced every couple of years. This is by far a better purchase for the money, and unlike a Macbook, if something should happen to this computer before the end of it's natural lifespan, it won't be devastating.
The best Chromebook yet, incredible value, screen, performance, keyboard sound, look and feel are all just right, highly recommended
Purchased this after owning a Samsung Series 3, as well as a Dell 11 chromebook. The Dell 11 was given to my son for college (he loves it). The Samsung was given to friends (it was pretty old).....so it was time to pick up another chromebook. I should note that I also use a 13" Macbook Pro at work, and a 15" Macbook Pro at home (mostly for gaming).<br/><br/>In a nutshell:<br/><br/>1. The screen is stunning. Great viewing angles. High Resolution. Great clarity and color reproduction. It is THE chromebook screen to beat.<br/><br/>2. The Baytrail processor is slow compared to the Haswell in my Dell 11. Why the industry would take a step backwards in speed just to get a fanless design is beyond me. I rarely heard the fans spin up my Dell 11....and battery life was better on that model.<br/><br/>3. Battery life was just OK. Not as good as the Dell which would get my through a whole work day on a single charge.<br/><br/>4. It wasn't really any thinner or lighter than my 13" Macbook.<br/><br/>5. In the end I sent it back. Too many issues with the latest version of chrome on OWA (scrolling issues, inability to add attachments, other attachment issues), mediocre battery life, VPN issues, and slow processor performance just couldn't justify the amazing screen and 4 gig of ram.<br/><br/>I've decided to pass on this generation of Baytrail processors. I'll try again once the next generation of processors is available, and Google has had a chance to work out the new rash of OWA bugs they introduced by eliminating the ShowModalDialogue API in version 37 of Chrome.
I purchased a Toshiba Chromebook 2 in November 2014 and it has been a nightmare ever since. The machine itself is power-packed but it almost immediately with absolutely not a nick of external force developed a screen issue where it displayed purple while showing a black background - this made it impossible to watch movies on the Chromebook. It cost $30 in shipping costs that Toshiba does not reimburse for me to send them this Chromebook, at which point they didn't fix it due to their internal miscommunication about the serial code. On a 2nd try of shipping this to them, they stated that the notebook was "Fixed" but performed no work meaning the same issue persists. I've spent hours on the line with Customer Service and they have refused any refund. I think their actions are downright fraudulent and on the same level as the accounting scandal that has been unfolding over the last year. I've accepted the fact that I've made a poor buying decision and will not be purchasing Toshiba products going forward.
Ever since I got this it has been nothing but bare bones. When I had a regular windows 7 dell laptop I would go on it constantly wasting my time and not using it for "productive" activities. Since I got this I only go on it to check emails and maybe a little youtube or to read articles. I don't get distracted with downloading things and only go on the internet and use google services for school. It is my first chromebook and I made an amazing choice. It never lags and when it does it is only due to my internet connection being extremely slow. There is nothing wrong hardware wise and it is a beauty compared to other chromebooks out there. The screen is wonderful even at the lowest brightness. And it is extremely comfortable and light for mobility. I love it. And I have had it for a month. I'll update it as time goes on.
I like ti a lot.... And my rating would be 4.5 if I could do so.<br/><br/>The screen is great and easy to see from most angles.  And its bright!<br/><br/>The keyboard is decent.  It could be better as i do a lot of text typing.<br/><br/>The built in camera for ?Hangouts and Skype is also decent but could be better.<br/><br/>Battery life matches the spec at 7-8 hours.. and that is better than I got with the 13.3 inch Acer chromebook.  Acer raated its book at 11 hours but i got only 6-7 hours.  So I think the Toshiba is a better choice since the screen is much better and the battery life was comparable for me.<br/><br/>The CB35 is also a little smaller and lighter.... only 13 inches on the screen but about inch less on the outside diagonal.  Its also about a half pound lighter and that matters a lot over a long day.
Best chromebook ( except $1000.00 + Pixel ) available, in my opinion.<br/>The screen size, 13.3", is ideal for me. My eyesight isn't the best so the 13.3" screen is very important to me.The majority of chromebooks have an 11.6" screen.<br/>The build quality of this Toshiba is outstanding too. The speakers, made by Skullcandy, sound terrific!<br/>But my favorite feature is the IPS screen. It is sharp and crisp! I've read other reviews where people said that the Toshiba's IPS<br/>screen rivals that of their Macbook.<br/>They state that the Toshiba Chromebook screen looks as good as their Mac's screen. I agree.<br/>The Toshiba's screen is a Full HD, 1080p screen.<br/>In summary, if you're looking for a quality chromebook, make sure to check out this Toshiba before you purchase anything else.<br/>Michael K.
Purchased this bc I did not want to deal with windows...broken windows. I am an Apple fan, own an iPhone 6 previously had 5 and recently sold a Mac Mini(purchased on Amazon) sold for a good price, I wanted a Macbook but common sense told me not to spend the $1400 for it. Having almost completely given up the notion to buy a computer and keep using my phone to search the web-I saw something about Google Chrome and felt compelled to research it. Turned out, it was rated highly(top 10) so, I decided to buy...and I love it!!! No, it does not have all the bells and whistles of the MB-BUT FOR THE PRICE, IT'S WAY BETTER THAN ANYTHING WITH WINDOWS OS!!!! There are plenty of links on Google to make it your own and it does not break your budget! Give it a try if you are open to something different, I don't think you will regret it!
Just simply Awesome, Just received it today and so far it is amazing. The screen on this has blown me away, crisp, colors are extremely vibrant. The bay trail processor gets a lot of crap from people who simply just go by numbers. If you are simple user and only using this for documents, YouTube etc. this is efficient enough. I am also in the process of installing Linux on it as many others have had good results with it and this allows you to run applications such as Skype which aren't available on the Chrome OS. In my honest opinion I think this Chromebook is a great buy. Build quality is amazing on par with some $900 netbooks, battery life is as advertised at 9-10 hours as long as you keep screen brightness below 75%. If you are on the fence about it, take my advice and hit that add to cart button !
I love it! Beautiful HD screen that makes reading the smallest type easy. I do a lot of typing and use the included Google word processing program.<br/>Almost instant startup. Everything is saved to the cloud as being typed so no chance of loosing something. Instant corrections also saved instantly. Will not run Windows programs but some like Word can be accessed in the cloud. Will not run Publisher which I miss. Printing is through the cloud and is a little slow but not objectionable. Printer must be cloud ready so you will have to buy a printer, but they less than $100. The keyboard is excellent! Battery off power lasts a long time, have not timed it. Even has great "Skullcandy" sound but not very loud. I did not buy a Chromebook version that is touch screen and sometimes wish I had.
when you need something more than your tablet, this is perfect.  access to all your google documents, spreadsheets, etc.
I'll update this review once I have a chance to put this machine through its paces, but I wanted to comment on the size for other first time Chromebook buyers. I was on the fence between an 11.6 inch and 13.3 inch model. I've only owned 14.1 inch screens and this is remarkably smaller than my old laptop (then again, that was purchased in 2009). I ended up choosing the full HD screen over ultraportability, but I was impressed by how small Toshiba managed to make this device. It's also a very sleek design, but tastes will vary there. My only complaint is the obnoxious Skullcandy branding.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm trying to say is my fears that this wouldn't be the small, easily portable laptop I had craved were allayed the second I took it out of the box. The size is perfect.
Beautiful screeen. SOlid design long batterie and fast delivery amazon 4/4 stars love it ! and of course great price!
I spent a few months struggling over which Chromebook to buy.  All the reviews say get this one, but quite a few people have had issues with the screen failing after only a few months and Toshiba blaming it on mishandling.  While I've not had any problems, I've also handled it with "kit gloves".  No issues yet and works as advertised.  I ended up getting a no-fault extended warrentee with the purchase.  The screen top is too flexible, so don't go giving this to someone that has problems taking care of electronics or travels a lot.  Since my traveling is limited and the risk is low given it's cost compared to standard Windows based laptops, I don't regret the purchase.  And don't forget, you can save a few bucks NOT getting virus protection for the unit.
Just what I needed to replace my laptop.  Great speed; easy to use; lightweight.  I would recommend this to anyone.
Great little gadget, until the Wifi radio stopped working for no reason.  Turned it on on day three of ownership and basically said Wifi is disabled and there was nothing I could do to bring it back.  It had been working perfectly up until that point.  It recognized no wireless networks at all.  It's as if a physical WiFi switch was turned off.  Did a power wash and did not help at all.  I got stuck on the welcome screen because there were "no networks available".  My windows laptop, iphone and ipad all recognized my network just fine.  I chatted with customer support and they wanted me to do a system restore.  This is a brand new Chromebook and up until that point all I had done was surf the internet. If the OS is that delicate that it needs a system restore that quickly then I want nothing to do with it. It feels like a hard ware issue.  I did a search and there are tons of people with the same issue but there is no real response to solve the problem.  Thankfully I can return it back to Amazon.  I've sworn off Chromebooks and will stick to Windows and Mac.
I've been a mac user for roughly 9 years now, and I bought this computer because I didn't want to spend $1000 on another computer. I typically only use my computers for video consumption (netflix & youtube), so there's no need for me to spend a lot of money on a really fancy computer. For the basic computer consumer, this computer is perfect. The screen is stunning (I think it's on par with my mac), the volume is way better than a mac computer (so much louder!), and it's way lighter than my macbook pro. It also fits in my purse, which makes it ideal for easy travel.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this computer enough! If you only need a computer for the internet, and google docs, then this is your computer! I would definitely repurchase again.<br/><br/>Edited on 8/26/15:<br/><br/>I have noticed that almost daily the entire computer will shut down for no reason, reboot right back up, and act as if nothing had happened. Except I have to reopen all of my tabs and deal with my computer suddenly rebooting. This is incredibly frsutrating, as it happens without warning or reason.<br/><br/>I have also noticed that sometimes the first minute or so of a video (youtube, netflix, etc.) will sound like a transformer, and I just have to wait it out until the sound fixes itself. This is incredibly annoying, as the speakers are supposed to be a huge selling point on this thing.<br/><br/>I have passed the point of warranty, but I would advise that anyone else who has these problems within the first month of purchase return their computer immediately and get a new one.<br/><br/>I'm honestly really bummed out, as this is exceptionally annoying and really dumb. I wish that I could return it and get a new one. Buyers beware!
Pros: Quick device that charges quickly. Good screen and front camera. Plus all of the usual nice things of Chromebook (fast boot, easy software, etc)<br/><br/>Cons: Hard sharp edges on the device. The build quality felt flimsy and the texture was prone to picking up grime. I understand that its an inexpensive device but the plastic on the palm rest would flex when typing and the entire device flexed when picked up. The keyboard was very flexy and the touch pad had some kind of sensitivity issues. One minute it would be fine the next I had to press hard or just keep swiping to get it to respond.<br/><br/>It was not a bad device, but I got a Samsung instead I am much happier. Better construction, better build quality, and just as quick.
We bought this Chromebook 2 for my 91-year-old mother-in-law.  It is simple and works well.  The screen is bright and very readable (we bought the HD version).  Set up with WiFi is very easy.  Biggest negative: does not accept a wired connection.  Be warned, though, that electronics stores sell adapters that apparently work for other Chromebooks, just not this one.  We wasted a lot of time trying adapters until my wife finally called Toshiba Support.  The other minor negative is that the icons are small.  I thought this would bother my mother-in-law more than it does so it is not a big deal. Biggest positives: great screen, exceedingly simple to use, easy to troubleshoot by phone. Overall, the Toshiba Chromebook 2 is a fine choice.
For most people, this is the only laptop you need.<br/><br/>This Chromebook is THE Chromebook to own right now. Fast, pretty display, excellent 1080p output, awesome battery life. Came with a free 1TB of Google Drive space (until the beginning of January 2014). Audio sounds pretty good, tested using over-ear and in-ear headphones, sounds great. Turns on in about three seconds, wakes up in one. Connects to wireless very fast, including the PEAP/WPA2; compared to a Macbook, this is remarkably fast connection as far as time to connect.<br/><br/>Physically, this Chromebook is both pretty and sturdy. While it's about the same size as the 13'' Macbook Air, this machine does not feel fragile. It's well built. I would recommend, 10/10.
Super fast boot and shutdown. Under 3 seconds each. If you are new to Chromebooks, research the limitations. These are NOT laptops. I use mine for using the web, playing Pandora, watching streaming movies etc. This Chromebook is so fast and inexpensive, I bought a second to keep in my garage to use while I am working out there. I attached a set of PC amplified speakers to it in the garage and use it to play Pandora. It's also nice to have access to email and other technical info when I need it. I like the fact that this model CB35-B3340 does not have a cooling fan and no moving parts (solid state hard drive). When in the garage, I don't have to worry about it sucking in dust. I keep it in a sleeve when not in use.
The Toshiba CB35-B3340 is the only chromebook available with 4gb of ram, a 1080p display, and a 2.14ghz celeron for under $300. Despite the sensible price, this chromebook is no slouch. The keyboard is accurate and reliable, and the touchpad is responsive. Battery life is excellent as can be expected from a chromebook, though slightly less than either of the lower-spec variants. It does everything I need and more, and has completely replaced my windows tablet for daily tasks. Though you forfeit the ability to use Windows desktop applications with a chromebook, you in turn get exceptional battery life, smooth and reliable operation, and timely updates all for the same price as a much less capable windows device.
First chromebook and i couldnt be happier. Since most of what i do is online anyway, this device is perfect.
Will never buy another toshiba laptop.<br/><br/>Works fine when it works.  Mine only worked for about 6 weeks. Since then I have had issues with the display. Laptop will boot up and can get some display when plugged into a monitor via the HDMI, but nothing on the screen and not usable through the monitor because half the screen is missing. Has been to the repair depot, for 6 weeks in December, then worked for a week. Back to the repair depot for another month, then worked for 3 days. Back to the repair depot for a month, and this time only worked for 3 hours.  Each time I send it in for repairs, they charge me $40, so I have already spent $120 to have it sitting in the toshiba repair queue for the last 8 months. That does not even count the fact that each time i have to call tech support, its 2-3 hours down the drain hole.
Great little machine. The mouse pad is a bit tricky to learn and it skips a bit but otherwise super duper.
My wife absolutely loves this Chromebook, I can't comment on it because she just won't give it to me !!!
Wow,,, totally amazing. Nice and thin notebook and boots right up. Very good quality and classy looking.
My child's school expects laptops from home. This chrome book does the job nicely for my freshman in high school. It's fairly lightweight and meets the requirements of being able to get to Google Docs, do research, and write papers and reports well at school.  So far, so good!<br/><br/>Update:<br/><br/>Purchased mid-August.  Stopped powering on yesterday, Oct 20th.  Won't charge.  No lights.  Tested with a second working AC adapter with no results. After talking to support, we will send in for repair at our expense for outgoing shipping.  From what I've read from other reviews, we are looking at several weeks before we know if it can be fixed.  Until then, my teen has no laptop for school.  Sigh.
The screen is sharper and clearer than my Macbook Air 2014, and looks comparable to the Macbook Retina.
Runs smooth. Love the screen. The speakers are loud and clear. The keyboard and mouse are easy to use.
<br/><br/>
This Chromebook gives the most bang for the buck. It has the right size screen at a good resolution.
Finally a nice Chromebook! I bought this online from Best Buy, because the prices on Amazon are jacked up due to it being sold out everywhere. I was honestly expecting to be disappointed (like I have been with all other Chromebooks), but I was blown away by the build quality and the 1080p screen... my God, the screen! The IPS panel on this thing is amazing and puts some $1,000+ laptops to shame.<br/><br/>For those of you wondering about running Crouton, go for it. I'm running it with xfce and haven't had any problems. The thing is fast... no stuttering or lagging, but I'm not exactly doing anything crazy. A few tabs or a 1080p video is probably the limit of what this $300 machine can do.<br/><br/>Short version: If you can find this thing, buy it. You won't be disappointed.
I know a lot of PC users like to talk about specks, and so did I at a point, but the fact is that most of us just want something: cheap, good looking, and portable.<br/><br/>I have a two-thousand dollar Gaming-PC and I can  a sure you that in the two weeks I have used this computer I never felt like I need to turn the PC on. Sure, I do miss the extra performance, but I just go to a point in which I felt like a fool- must of us don't need 8 cores or a 800 dollar graphics cards, must of us just want to watch Netflix and browse Twitter.<br/><br/>This is the cheapest computer I have ever bought by far, and I am willing to say that it is also the best.
As far as getting what you paid for - this laptop delivers. It's light, easy to use, fast, and handles smoothly and cleanly with very few errors. If you aren't a Chromebook user it will take some time getting used to and be prepared to do without some familiar programs you may have gotten used to in the past. My advice if you're considering whether to purchase this or a Microsoft/Mac would be to decide which features/programs are most useful to do and then research if they are available for Chromebook.<br/><br/>Other than that, I have been using this laptop for 4 months and am very happy with the battery life and overall performance.
What a great deal. Great price, and it was so light I thought they had shipped me an empty box!
Best chromebook.. Great 1080p. Good laptop for price.. Not perfect.. Could be a little faster.
Bought this as a cheap replacement for a dead windows laptop.  I do a limited number of things with my computers:  email, shop, social media, amazon instant video/netflix, and photo editing.  It does four of the five really, really well.  It's ok with photo editing.  As far as I can tell there's really only one good chromeOS photo editor (Polarr).  I realize that's more a criticism of ChromeOS than the laptop, but it's kinda one and the same being a chrome book.<br/><br/>Pros:  light weight, bright sharp screen, long battery life<br/>Cons:  Feels a little 'under-powered' when doing things like photo editing (big files)
Similar observations as other reviews:<br/><br/>- Nice screen; has a lot of real estate, but text is pretty small.<br/>- Battery life is really good -- 8+ hours as advertised.<br/>- I set up the Linux environment (crouton, xfce).  It was rock solid (switching back and forth between the xfce the Chromebook desktops), but lately it's gotten a little flakey.  Could be user error, though.<br/>- Good for taking on-line classes (that's why I installed Linux)<br/>- Quiet (no moving parts)<br/>- Doesn't get hot (that I've noticed, yet)<br/>- Light weight; good for travel<br/>- Power adapter is maybe half the size of one for a Dell or ThinkPad laptop.  It measures about 3.25 x 1.25 x 1 inches; lighter weight, too
The Toshiba Chromebook 2 is hands-down one of the best purchases I've made in a while. I own a desktop and wanted a laptop device that I could "beat up", and this product fits my needs perfectly. It's (relatively) cheap, lightweight, has excellent battery life, boasts an amazing screen, and can perform most (but not all) the functions I require from a laptop.<br/><br/>Note that I don't download large files (looking at you, torrent sites), and I utilize cloud services for most storage (Evernote & Google Drive/Photos). Because of this, I sold my Macbook Air in favor of utilizing my Chromebook on the go.
Battery life is great for work. Restaurant manager personally, so quick access to personal projects is a lifesaver. Lightweight, would strongly recommend using sleeve at all times, but portability is effortless. Resolution is impressive for casual youtube/ Netflix lovers, audio is stunning for such a little guy.<br/><br/>Offline capabilities lacking - apps have potential to increase utilization but memory is limited; find a few must-haves and remove clutter regularly.<br/><br/>*word to the working  man - verse yourself in translation (ie - GoogleSheets-to-OfficeExcel) to maximize efficiency.
I have had this Chromebook for a few months with no problems.  It does take some getting used to, but there is plenty of online help.  Unlike some other reviewers, this hasn't been the laptop I use most nor has it become my "go to" laptop.  I can say that it is the one I take with me on my travels ... size and weight being the primary reasons. I am still in the process of weaning myself from Microsoft - lol - but this will never completely happen due to compatibility with work network interfaces and applications.  I'm glad I purchased it but haven't used it as much as I thought I would.
Awesome deal for my parents. Their PC went out and they wanted something easy and portable which I was sure about since they are of late age. And had always had a key board and mouse. Wow, I was so pleasantly surprised with the ChromeBook !  Easy to set up , keyboard since they type differently than me had no issue and I am learning from them...!  Perfect and easy , I am even considering one for me. Make life simple with all you need !<br/>The price ! Incredible ! I did pay 30 $ more but noticed it came down within 7 days and Amazon refunded me the difference ! Thanks for the great Chomebook !
I've had an older chromebook that has been dropped at least 4 times.  There are things rattling inside but it still works.  The mouse-pad is a bit touchy and really only works well with a mouse now.  This is why I bought a new one.  I converted from Mac about 2 years ago and have never looked back.  This new chromebook is very light, has absolutely everything I need, speakers are fantastic, it's very light and easy to slip into my enormous purse.  Plus, the screen is off the hook.  The newest updates with design and such are great.  I'd be surprised if I ever go back to a traditional laptop.
The screen is great on this Chromebook, and performance overall is excellent. The keyboard is solid, not spongy like with some low cost laptops. It's not 5 stars because of the build quality: I had to have a replacement unit sent out because the display panel was crooked and off center inside the frame. I even had a bottom plate screw just fall out. Sadly, the replacement screen was even more crooked. Amazon's customer service was great as usual. They were even willing to send me a third but even they wondered if it would be any better. Overall a great laptop, but you might get a lemon.
Let me say that I normally don't write reviews, But I love this device, the screen is stunning, battery like GREAT, keyboard great, BUT it isn't backlit which I really like in my Dell Inspiron laptop, The trackpad is great, I have seen YouTube videos criticizing it but I love it, it is very responsive, don't get me wrong it's not like a Macbook but it works great for the pricepoint as the cost of this Chromebook is 1/5 the price of a Macbook.<br/><br/>It is fast, responsive and a great deal, I would not hesitate to buy a second one if I needed it.<br/>All in all its a great product.
doesnt work with skype at the moment but hangouts replaces it very well, i prefer it now. boots up so fast i leave it off when not in use. watched netflix for about 6-7 hours before the battery died. no matter how many things are open it doesn't slow down, screen is glossy finish, but the colors are bright enough to come through, would have prefered matt. does have one display resolution higher than 1920x1080 but everything is too small. the speakers in the laptop are awesome, first laptop i've had that the volume doesn't have to be maxxed out to hear things. I use this laptop primarily for video chat entertainment, and email, it does all of these superbly
Easily the best looking screen on a Chromebook:  Sharp, bright, rich colors.  Actually prefer this to the screen on my Macbook Air.<br/><br/>Fast enough to run web pages, watch movies, etc. -- all without hiccups. And, it's fanless.  Absolutely quiet.  This is a HUGE advantage over our Macbook Air that has a noisy fan anytime you do something the least bit strenuous (a la watch a movie).  If we're going to watch a movie on a laptop device, this is our "go to" laptop.<br/><br/>Traveled extensively with this since it is decently light and cheap.  Held up well.
Perfect for surfing the net, and holds a charge all day. Works best with a mouse, as the scroll pad has issues if you attempt to use it to copy/past anything. I manage my website with it, and it's the fastest I've ever been able to use the dashboard to manage the site. I had hoped to use it to also manage what's stored on my Samsung tablet, but I can't get it to even acknowledge that is tethered to it. It also won't download and manage my Picasa account to manage my photo's, which is pretty silly. It practically has no weight, and charges super fast.
I love my Toshiba Chromebook ! Quiet keyboard that feels solid when typing ! I got used to the differences between windows and chrome fairly fast and actually like that there are some things I can't do on Chrome like save to desktop ! I save other stuff on a flash drive and like that as well as it is not junking up my laptop !  I also stream to my tv and that was really easy to set up and works well !<br/>If you want a good computer for just simple surfing , Facebook  or what ever , this is a good one to buy .
All the technical stuff about this chromebook has been said a thousand times over so I won't go there. I want to let people know that there are covers you can place on this chromebook that look amazing. There are also nice bags for this chromebook to protect your investment. I purchased both & it really makes this unit look even better as well as adding extra protection. I just want to add that everyone is talking about it's beautiful screen so hey, we may as well dress up the body too - just a thought !
It looks sleek and feels awesome.  Battery life is excellent.  Performance is amazing.  I love my first Chromebook and look forward to watching these genius products evolve.  The price was incredibly fair for what it offers.  I use it mainly for writing and research for academic writing, and the Chrome Store has countless amazing Apps and Extensions that I've only scratched the surface of.  I'll try to remember to update this review after I've had it for 6 months or a year (instead of just a few weeks).
I love this notebook so far. It was my first chromebook and it met every single one of my expectations.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>Incredibly bright display<br/>Crisp, clean text<br/>As far as I can tell, a pretty good WIFI card<br/>Really light (2 and a half pounds!)<br/>Incredible keyboard<br/>Great Speakers<br/>Others that I'm not thinking of<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Some screen flex if you push against it<br/>Some stuttering, however I have only had this happen to me when I have 15+ tabs open.<br/>Battery life is closer to 5 hours with the brightness really high
I am by no means a computer expert.  I have had the 3340 Chromebook for about a week.  It is just an outstanding unit.  The screen resolution is just magnificent and the sound from the speakers is unlike any I have ever heard, outside of some very expensive setups.  Although the keys are not back lit, it is very easy to use in low light because of the black keys contrasting with the silver case.  I am a retired 70-something and this Chromebook fits my needs to a T.  Could not be more pleased!
The Toshiba Chromebook does its job extremely well.  The screen is very bright with great resolution.  This is a fantastic bargain for those who essentially live with internet.  There is virtually no memory (external works fine) and no tools like Word, and I knew that going in.  The only problem is with the touchpad, which is, well, "touchy".  I'm going to use a mouse in order to have more control, but, given its cost and the general excellence of the computer, that's not a big deal.
Silver color is better than dark black. Chrome is not only a browser but also a platform. I tried to find some offline app for video player but failed. I have tried dev os in this chromebook and get the app I want, but this dev os is based on chrome os so it is not fast as I expect. As I know Google service is not eaisly available in China mainland, so maybe I will still use dev os which is just like Ubuntu. I hope one day this notebook can boot from outside driver such as win8 to go.
I liked it so much I eventually bought three more for friends as gifts.
Screen flickered, turned pink and failed within 2 hours of use.  I am surprised they keep shipping with the same known defect after several months.  I like the Google's Chromebook concept though.<br/><br/>The outer shipping container was fine but the Toshiba product box was wet and even moldy.  I don't think the screen defect was related since the moisture didn't appear to have penetrated the unit itself.<br/><br/>It's going back this weekend. I am glad it happened on the first day so I expect a simple return process.
Its awsome
Great HD display, this what's makes this chromebook and the 4gb ram.
simple best quality dislpay and sound and so light and im very happy
I personally purchased this Chromebook through best buy I've had it for a few days and love it. I use to have a Microsoft pc and I hated it, it got to complicated. I love the simplicity of the Chromebook and as an Android user it work PERFECTLY with my devices!! I'm so happy with my purchase the screen is beautiful and so user friendly!!!!! I also love how light and portable it is. I just need to order a sleeve for it to throw it in my purse at any time!
Okay, here's my one-star review, to add to all the rest; my Chromebook's display stopped working after about 2 months. It just suddenly would not come on one day, even though the power light would come on. A pity; this was a really nice computer before it failed. Of course, the time involved to rectify this issue is as aggravating as the problem itself.<br/>Now let's see what Toshiba has to say... will they refuse to help me as they have refused to help so many other of the their FORMER customers?
All-in-all, this laptop is a joy to use, and a breath of fresh air from my past laptop experiences. I have spent $700 on a laptop, and that didn't hold a candle compared to this $330 beauty ($299 at the time of this writing). Between its lightweight body, beautiful screen, great speakers, and Chrome OS, I'm not sure I'll be able to find something in the same price area to compete with this.<br/>Read more of my thoughts here: http://wp.me/p4niR7-jp
Such a great/fast computer for the price. I was skeptical about buying my first Chromebook but I have to say that I am very satisfied. I'm able to download pretty much any app to handle programs that windows offers. For instance, since this is a Chromebook you cannot install Microsoft Office. However, you can download the free apps for each of the programs. You also have access to Googles versions of these programs for free as well. Love it!
Great Chromebook. Bought the first one about 8 months ago for my wife. She uses it everyday and is very pleased with it. I noticed how fast it was compared to my Windows laptop. I started borrowing hers and liked it so much I bought one for myself. I use mine several hours everyday. The only time I use my windows laptop is when I need to use QuickBooks. My brother also ordered one and he likes it much better than his windows laptop too.
The 13.3-Inch Toshiba Chromebook 2 truly distinguishes itself with its absolutely vibrant and beautiful full-HD IPS display, along with its understated and elegant design, and its very capable Intel Celeron N2840 processor, which delivers long battery life and all-day run time. This outstanding Toshiba Chromebook 2 continues to be one of the best Chromebook computers available, and I enthusiastically give it my highest recommendation.
It has taken me a while to get used to a Chromebook after using Windows and Apple for so long. I do miss having iTunes and other software on the computer but as I primarily use my laptop for the internet it works great.<br/><br/>I bought 3 of these computers and in 2 of them the sound frequently becomes distorted and the computer has to be restarted. It is an easy fix but is an inconvenience if multiple tabs and projects are open.
I love this chromebook. I took a lot of time to pick the right one and this one is definitely it. It looks and feels nice. Runs quickly and last the whole day I don't even bring a charger with me and I work on my chromebook literally all day. The screen has a beautiful image but it does have a glare which usually isn't an issue unless you are outside and the sun is behind you. But I work inside and you can see a glare inside at all.
Great value! I bought this after having a MacBook Air.<br/><br/>Keyboard is soft and well-spread. HD display is worth the money! I've found it to be better than that of the Air (non-retina). Speakers are a little wonky and turn some Youtube videos into House music tracks by repeating the same one-second bit over and over and over again. Strange problem, but worth the pain considering it's just a fraction of the cost of a MacBook
I love my chromebook 2  it's amazing! Awesome but absolutely! !
Pretty sweet little notebook. Super fast with a great screen. Takes a bit of getting used to in terms of what it can do without an internet connection ie: PDF viewers offline, but is only a minor inconvenience. I imagine it will get better with increased popularity. Well worth the price.<br/><br/>Had a small screen defect with the first one I got, but Amazon promptly sent me a replacement and made the return super easy.
I am just your average computer user that does FB and shops on Amazon so this computer is perfect for me.  I love it so much I may never go back to a "regular" windows computer again.  I have an office job if I need to print something so I don't even have to deal with figuring out how to print at home. (as some people mentioned was a little bit of a hassle)  I highly recommend.  Fast, easy to use and light weight.
Quite simply, the most useful piece of computer technology I have so far owned.<br/>Was expecting it to be an online-only tool, except for email and documents etc but pleasantly surprised by the number and power of apps that can also be used offline e.g.wevideo for video editing.<br/>If I had the budget, I would buy the Google Pixel version for the physical build in metal- but the Tosh CB35 HD version is all I need.
About a month in at this point, and my wife couldn't be happier with the Chromebook.  The old fear that other software couldn't interact with MS Office is long gone -- the google aps work great.  Machine is blazingly fast and the google storage is fast and accessible even at DSL speeds. If you're doing major video or photo editing this might not be for you, but for just about anything else it works great.
I love this Chromebook. Just be sure you understand the capabilities and limitation of a Chromebook before you get one. I did and I am very satisfied with what I got for the price I paid.<br/><br/>The screen is amazing and the computer is quick with very little slow down even with many tabs open.<br/><br/>The only thing I don't like too much is the track pad as the mouse sometimes clicks on its own.
It starts quick, has good battery life and is able to edit Word documents (with the correct app).  The screen resolution is excellent, and it is easy to use.  Drawbacks are that the cloud printing (the only way to print with this device) is really inconsistent.  It took one document 24 hours to finally find my HP Office Jet.  The support for the device is pretty much limited to forum questions.
Beautiful screen. Run smooth and fast even with tons of tabs. I use Google Drive and OneDrive at the same time, and they both run great. My only complain is that it gets hot on the bottom far end near the screen, but Macbook Air has the same problem too, so I get it is a minor issue. Buy this if you cannot afford a Macbook Air and are tired of Windows high maintenance and slow-ish-ness.
I absolutely love my Toshiba Chromebook 2 IPS 1080P computer. Fast, light, and the battery lasts forever. The speakers are absolutely perfect for Netflix, and they get LOUD! The screen is akin to a Macbook Pro and looks crystal clear with deep colors. Highly recommended to anyone who needs a computer for notes, emails, netflix, etc. and doesn't want the hassle of Microsoft or Apple.
It works well, and is speedy and seems well-constructed.
If you want something fast ,just to enjoy the internet - get this model. I already bought 2. Strictly for emails- playing games- watching vids or movies-surfing-listening to music and you'll get no hassles.  The Chromebook is a fun book- a way to enjoy being online.  I personally would not bother using it for work/productivity applications but the apps are there if you wish to.
One of the best tools I've gotten in a long long time.
The Toshiba Chromebook 2 is a fantastic chromebook.  The display quality is the best I have seen on any Chromebook (there is more to display quality than resolution; the color depth is impeccable).  The only negative I saw before ordering was the choice of processor, but after using it I can barely notice any sluggishness at all.  I highly recommend this unit.
Wow!! What an improvement over the first generation of this Chromebook!  The screen is outstanding while the speed is very satisfactory.  I'm not going to get into the gritty details of this Chromebook.  I will leave that to others but I do like this above all others.  I highly recommend this Chromebook for just surfing the web!  Well done this time around!!
I bought this five months ago and the display went out. I sent pictures to Customer service. They said it isn't covered under the 1 yr mfr warranty and that I should be more careful in opening and closing the computer. I will never buy a Toshiba product again. They make them too flimsy for normal use.  I have been buying laptops for many years but this is the first and last Toshiba.
Had a dead pixel in the middle of the screen. It was too noticeable for me to disregard so I really had to just return it. The seller shipped fast, wasn't exactly as described but the product itself was great. Haven't had a laptop screen look this good before, and I had a Macbook Air 2013. I'd buy this Chromebook, if I didn't have a Macbook already though.
This is an outstanding laptop.  Getting used to the Google world but so far love it.  Need Internet to access storage but where do we use it without Internet access these days?  For the price and how we use it for homework and general searches I can buy 3 for what I spent on a Macbook.  Super fast.  Boots right up.  Light weight.  I highly recommend this.
As advertised.  Did lots of research and not disappointed.  Got a "refurbished' Amazon Warehouse for a significant discount and it was flawless.  Small learning curve from Windows, but if you Youtube hints and pointers, it's easier than and laptop I've ever own.  Don't think I will ever purchase a Windows machine again.  The Cloud is da Bomb!
This is the chromebook to get.  It has none of the highest-end specs you might expect.  It's unabashedly plastic, and mold is hardly the highest quality I've seen.  and it tries very hard to imitate metal, which is of limited appeal, honestly.  Still, it's a beautiful machine,  with a great screen and it's fast enough, especially for the price.
Thank you! Everything is OK, quality is very good!
Loving this chromebook!  So easy to use, fast to wake up, light to carry, and the price can't be beat.  It gets a little hot on my lap, but that's about it.  Doesn't have a CAPS lock so if you're one of those people that type in all caps, you'll be disappointed.  Or maybe you'll just learn that you're not supposed to type in all caps anyway.
I'm persnickety guy so not much gets my approval. I'm also a technology snob as my wife calls me. With that being said this is a solid and we'll built machine. I was immediately impressed with the build quality when I opened the box. This computer has excellent battery life, intuitively designed and just is fantastic. Well done Toshiba.
I have had this computer for a few months now. You will love this computer if you clearly understand Chromebooks, so do your research....I used Youtube !! This computer is way different than Apple and Windows.  I have a windows 10 computer but I still use my Chromebook more than my windows pc.....once you get one you will know why !!!!
I like it.  Screen and keyboard are great.  Already use Google products extensively and knew this device's limitations (there aren't many).  I don't like general web-surfing on iPads, so this resolves that and has become our primary computer, despite a nice PC being upstairs (the hike up the stairs to it rarely makes sense anymore).
outstanding!  Fast, easy to use and doesn't let you down<br/>Ridiculously long cable for charging is a great touch.<br/>Seconds to boot, if in doubt over others, don't go anywhere else.  This is a marvelous machine.  Just what I wanted for a portable go anywhere machine.<br/>Make sure it is your second computer obviously.
An amazingly powerful device that is simply amazing to look at. So convenient when I'm out and about.<br/><br/>Once you learn the ChromeOS ecosystem its all plain sailing. Hasn't yet missed a beat and every day I learn more efficiency tweaks. Superb value as well. A big thumbs up to Toshiba and Google, I am now a convert.
Amazing machine. I've been using it for quite a while now, and it's hands down one of the best laptops I've ever used. It has a fantastic screen, most certainly the best one you can get for the price. It handles many tabs like a champ, hardly ever slowing down or lagging. I highly recommend this chromebook.
I use Toshiba CB2 within few days, it is completely enough to me, also I found out normal web / movie using  are close to 4gb ram, so for my suggestion don’t buy 2gb ram Chromebook. Of cause you can’t expect CB2 final quality can compare with Mac Air, base on the C/P value CB2 real a awesome Chromebook
Love it! Beautiful screen,easy to use,fast.
Got this as a Christmas gift for my wife. She loves the HD screen and it's easy to carry around the house it weighs only 3 lbs. She's been using it for a month now and no complaints yet. This is a perfect laptop for browsing and checking emails. You get a fast connection using the 802.11 AC WIFI.
I was hesitant on getting a chromebook.  I had recently returned the Samsung Chromebook 2 due to the screen appearing slightly blue in tint.  This laptop is incredible.  It is fast, streams very well, the screen is beautiful, and it lasts me about 8 hours.  I have had it for about 2 months.  No regrets.
I have had this Toshiba for seven months now.  I don't have one complaint about it.  I use it all day every day because it is such a pleasure to use.<br/>My Acer and Apple are collecting dust.  What a great screen and sound it has.  I am on the verge of getting another one of them.
Excellent bang for your buck. Fantastic battery life, image quality, and simplicity. Only minor flaw I notice is the trackpad, whose scrolling ability is not as smooth as my macbook pro. Otherwise, no regrets about selling my old macbook pro in favor of this fine piece of equipment.
We got the Chromebook as a replacement for my wife's Windows laptop which was getting slow and troublesome.  She says she sees no difference (except for being faster and less troublesome) so this means, for what she does - email, facebook, surf the web, she does not need Windows.
This Chromebook is excellent. Simple yet comprehensive for a standard set of computing needs.<br/><br/>I originally purchased the lower quality screen- DO NOT waste any time or money on it. The difference in screen quality between it & this model is night and day, and more.
Unbelievably fragile screen! It cracked like an eggshell when I gently opened it in the normal way. A horrible shortcut marring an otherwise great system.  Don't think of buying this without the warranty and better yet buy something more durable so you don't waste your time.
A very fine Chrome Book, and I'm extremely satisfied with it.  The large -- 13 1/2 inch -- screen is clear and well-lit, keyboard easy to use, and it definitely has answered all my needs and wishes for all that a Chrome Book has to offer.  I would highly recommend it.
Great for what it is.  Display is very high quality.  Over all it feels like it should be a much more expensive machine then it is.  First time with a chromebook and I really am enjoying the ease of the operating system.  So far I have nothing to say but good things.
Excellent computer for my purposes at this time. I no longer need to use VPN from a Microsoft OS to work from home and I'm finding that the Google apps are enough. I did install Ubuntu Linux and a few more powerful apps in case I need more. I love the instant on.
Great form, screen. Struggles a bit with rendering more complex websites, but it's probably one of the better chromebooks for doing that. The build quality is acceptable and the keyboard is useful. If you're looking to get into the ChromeOS world, start here!
I have to give this five stars. The screen is great. I like the spongy keyboard. I set up a standard printer in google print and it works like a champ.<br/>I use an AC router and this thing is plenty fast. I haven't used my Windows laptop since I got this.
First chromebook so nothing to compare against but excellent so far.<br/><br/> Trackpad is a little awkward but slotting a wireless mouse in makes all the difference.<br/><br/>Battery life could be a little better but for the money I'm a happy chappy.
First hour using it and it feels great! As fast as expected, boots faster than any other laptop I've ever had, speakers are quite good and the HD display looks beautiful. Touchpad feels a bit fragile but I can let that pass. Feels very solid as a whole.
Gift for my mother and she loves it.
Very Good, awesome battery life. We only charge it once a day, and we constantly use it. Good for everything except playing online games, which doesn't work because of the absence of a proper GPU. But we're not using it for that so we're happy with it.
Light, responsive, battery lasts forever, speakers are pretty kick-ass. If all you're doing is web surfing and email, it's a sweet little unit. I use it mostly at home where I am never without a network connection. For what it is, it's a fine machine.
Got this laptop for my BF when his Macbook finally died on him. Literally died. It doesn't turn on or charge anymore. My BF is not at all technologically savvy. He spends most days reading sports articles online, writing emails, checking his social media, and watching shows online, so buying another Mac couldn't be justified. He wouldn't be utilizing all or any of it's features. He didn't with the first one. Actually, he didn't even know about most of its features until I showed him. At that point, he'd had the computer for years. Hahaha.<br/><br/>I began researching laptops that would be perfect for my BF's needs and saw Chromebooks. They're quick, easy to use, not prone to viruses, and integrate seamlessly with Google Drive (something we already use on a regular basis). This looked like a great choice and it had great reviews, so I took the plunge and we both love it! We've had the computer since July and the first couple weeks, my BF kept remarking how much he LOVED his new laptop, how fast it was, and how beautiful and vibrant his screen was. He didn't miss the Macbook at all. The only hiccup we came across was not being able to have iTunes on the Chromebook. We knew it was incompatible and decided to just work around it. I have my own laptop, but I do use his quite often. My charger is upstairs so when my laptop starts to die, I switch to his. Lol. I'm lazy. It's great because I already use the chrome browser for work and personal stuff. It's easy to sign in and have all my bookmarks and data on his device as well as mine. If I didn't do graphic/web design & need certain programs like Photoshop, I'd definitely get a Chromebook as my main device. In fact, my mom just told me she needed a new laptop, so I'm going to get her a Chromebook for Christmas!
First off, the 1920x1080 IPS display is absolutely stunning. For $330, there is no better screen on the market. If you normally use Google products, then I highly recommend this laptop. After opening the package, it booted up in seconds with just my Gmail ID. I'll breakdown some of the features of this Chromebook:<br/><br/>STORAGE: Many people may be putoff by the 16GB storage, but it isn't an issue at all. Google wants you to use the cloud for your computing needs and gives you 100GB of Google Drive storage. There is also an SD card slot for extra storage. In addition, you can use Microsoft OneDrive on this for more storage. I have a few USB sticks that I use more than the actual Chromebook storage anyway. For photos, I highly recommend Google Photos. Google Photos gives you UNLIMITED storage as long as you are uploading photos in standard format.<br/><br/>PROGRAMS: If you aren't familiar with Chromebooks, everything is done through the Chrome browser. Instead of downloading .exe programs onto your computer, you download apps and extensions through the browser. I use Youtube, Twitter, Facebook, Netflix, Xfinity TV to Go, Spotify as I normally would on any computer. You can also download a program called Arc Welder which allows you to run Android Apps on the Chromebook. For me, this was a gamechanger since it allowed me to run Skype and the VLC Media Player (for playing .wmv videos which aren't functional on Chromebooks). There are many Youtube videos and forums on how to run Android Apps on the Chrome OS.<br/><br/>PRODUCTIVITY: Google gives you its office suite (which is its alternative to Microsoft Office) for free. You can edit a document on Google Docs, but save it as a Microsoft Word doc. The Chromebook is mostly for online use, but you can download extensions and change settings in Google Drive so you can edit and  work on files offline. Some folks have complained about "not being able to work offline," but I can't think of the last time I used a computer without being online. Printing  is done via Google Cloud Printing. Essentially, most wireless printers work. I use the Brother MFC-J47ODW which works perfectly. I'm guessing wired printers work, but I've never tried it.<br/><br/>DISPLAY: Like I mentioned earlier, this 1080p IPS display is stunning. The print is on the small side, but this is expected with sharp displays like this. I just use control and the  "+"  sign to make words larger if needed.<br/><br/>BATTERY: The battery life is superb.<br/><br/>OVERALL: To get a display this nice, you'd have to shell out about $1200 for a Mac or $600 or more for a Windows machine. For $330, I got one heck of a machine that I hope to enjoy for a while.
Reviewing something like a Chromebook is hard because what do you review, the hardware (Toshiba) or the software (Google)? I think you try to find a good balance between the two, first, after some time of using this machine, I want to mention the things that have are not great first:<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Support for movie files is spotty at best. For example, I've downloaded AVI files (supposedly supported) and the video doesn't show but the sound does and others where its the opposite. This might not sound like a big deal...but just wait till you want to use the Chromebook on a non-internet moment, like say, in the car for your kids to watch a movie or a plane. That part is really frustrating.<br/>- No support AT ALL for external dvd players - dont even try it, I bought one for a plane ride, discovered it didnt work mid-flight.<br/>- Screen resolution is a computer setting, not a user/profile setting<br/><br/>Conclusion on Cons: If you want to use a Chromebook as a media device, think "internet", think netflix/hulu/amz prime etc. Dont expect to have a movie on a usb drive and have that work, it'll only frustrate you.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Size (this machine is used by everyone in my house, so the size is a big plus, easy to carry even for a 8 years old boy)<br/>- Multiple profiles (We all have our own profiles so our content is separate, whats best, you can have a setting to leave certain profiles "loaded" so that if someone decides to use your computer, your browsing history is not lost)<br/>- Battery (this thing lasts a long time unless you do a lot of streaming videos)<br/>- Hardware (good keyboard and good sound, also, all my  Bluetooth devices work with it, namely headphones and mouses)<br/><br/>SUPER PRO: With Remote Desktop from the Chrome Store I can log-in to a windows machine I have on the basement and use it. This is a BIG plus because everytime I need to use, say, Office, I just remote connect to that box and use it, it runs full screen on the chromebook so it feels like Im using a normal PC. This was a unexpected surprise and it works perfectly. Whats more, the box on the basement is only connected, it doesnt need a monitor or anything, it just needs to be turned on and have the plugin running (all free, really easy to setup). Also, those connections are based on your google account which makes it even better.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Its a great little laptop and I would recommend to everyone if you know what you are getting.
I use this machine for online math classwork and as a basic note taking machine for college stuff. For the most part, I love this little thing.<br/><br/>+Light as all get-out. Super nice to carry compared to my heavy, higher specced laptop.<br/><br/>+Screen is just gorgeous. A full 1080 IPS panel is worth it just in itself. It absolutely destroys 1366x786 TN Chromebooks (..and Macbook Airs).<br/><br/>+Processor is surprisingly good for what it's built for. It performs well with any web task I throw at it. Hell, it even emulates F-Zero X at 60 fps (on Ubuntu).<br/><br/>+Battery is excellent. 9+ hrs light use, 5+hrs heavy use.<br/><br/>+Fan-less design is nice. It does get a little toasty, but nothing too bad.<br/><br/>+Very easy to install Ubuntu using Crouton.<br/><br/>+Port variety is perfect for this computer. Storage can be expanded with a regular sized SD card that will fit flush with the case.<br/><br/>------------<br/><br/>~Chrome OS is totally fine for what it is. It's just a web browsing OS. Nothing more, Nothing less.<br/><br/>~Screen resolution and viewing angles are excellent, but there is a little bit of washout on the blacks.<br/><br/>------------<br/><br/>-1080p video content on Youtube runs fine at 30fps, but this little computer rides the struggle bus on 1080p 60fps. Twitch streams at ~900p seem to be okay at 60fps.<br/><br/>-Other than the screen, this computer does feel a little cheap. It's not the worst, but it certainly is plastic-y<br/><br/>-Keyboard is pretty shallow. Didn't expect much on this front anyways. It's passable.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a great little computer for light school work. If anything, it's just nice to have that awesome battery life and a fairly nice screen to consume content on. 8/10 bretty good.
A lot of the negative reviews surrounding chromebooks, in my opinion, are due to misunderstanding of what the idea behind the chromebook is. The Chromebook is a nice cheap little laptop powered by google that puts convenience before all else It doesn't really do anything fancy, nor does it compete with the power of a more expensive computer. The chromebook is good for those who don't need a $800 computer, and are just looking for something easy to use.<br/>Before buying a chromebook, you need to ask yourself a few questions. The first question is, "Do I use google chrome (or firefox, internet explorer, etc.) 99% of the time I am on the computer?" If the answer to this question is yes, then you have come to the right place. Chromebooks are browser based computers and what I mean by this is almost all of the applications for this computer are located in the google chrome browser. This means that if you need to use out of browser programs, or Windows/Macintosh specific programs you will not be able to use them on the chromebook. Examples of these programs include, Word, Excel, Outlook, iWork, Final cut, etc. The next question you should ask yourself at this point is, "Why do I need to use these specific programs?" If you need specific programs in your daily life, this computer is not for you! However, google offers alternative to these programs like Google Docs, Google Slides, Gmail, pretty much anything you can think of just slap a google before it and it will be there somewhere. The thing you need to be prepared with before buying a chromebook is the fact that unless you are a heavy google product user, you will need to become one in order to use the chromebook. Google offers many alternative to the programs you use outside of your browser, so for all of those programs you might need, look to see if there is a google alternative out there and try using it before you make a purchase. Finally, you should ask "Will this be my only computer?" Another computer could include a work computer, or any computer that you may have access to. This is an important question to ask, because I would not recommend anyone outside of highschool to have this as their only computer. This is because there is the possibility you will need a program for school, work or personal activities and there is no Google alternative. This is where you would want to have a second computer where you can do your main work. I have a windows desktop, and I think of my chromebook as just a big phone. It does everything I would need it to do when I'm out and about and that's all I expect from it. You don't get a smartphone and use it like a personal computer, you get a smartphone to have something mobile and convenient when you are away from your computer and this is how I think of the chromebook.<br/>Overall, the chromebook is not a revolutionary computer or device. However, it is cheap, easy to learn how to use and a very convenient laptop that I would recommend you look into. Maybe before buying, go a week or two by ONLY using google products and programs and see what you think for yourself. If you can, and you like the google alternatives - The chromebook is for you!<br/>Now, for the Toshiba is particular. I am not the best person when it comes to what specs for a computer are good or not, but as far as I saw the Toshiba Chromebook 2 had some of the best. This was actually not my first choice however, I first ordered a HP chromebook but due to a shipping error had my order was canceled. To me, the hardware of the computer wasn't that important. I knew that I wouldn't be doing anything crazy on this computer, and that I was more concerned about the appearance of the case. The HP case looks really nice, and that is why I chose it. However, since receiving the Toshiba, I am really happy I chose this one instead. It is hard to see from the picture, but the Toshiba has a nice silver case and along it are (it is hard to describe) these little bumps that provide a very nice texture to it. The keyboard is what I expected - a little tight but solid. Two things I like the most about it is the touchpad and the weight. It is very light, easy to hold and the touchpad is by far the best touchpad I have ever used. I never really liked them and haven't really used them in the past, but this one is so nice. Two biggest complaints are the screen and material the case is made out of. When I say screen, I don't mean the glass portion I am talking about the rim of the screen. It is very thin and feels like if I were to bend it too hard (when opening or closing), I could damage it. While I really like the look of the case, the material feels a little cheap. I think it would dent easily (already found a small chip on the bottom) and feels like it doesn't provide that much support. Overall I would recommend it to someone looking for a chromebook, especially because the Toshiba has one of the best screens in the chromebook market.<br/>Good Luck!
The biggest selling point for this laptop is the FHD display, which is bright and renders colors faithfully. Viewing angles are sufficient for two (maybe three) people watching videos together.<br/><br/>I've also found the processing speed to be more than sufficient for multitasking (which on a chromebook basically means having a lot of Chrome tabs open). Right now, I have more than 20 tabs open (it's a problem I'm working on...) without any slowdown. There is also no fan, which means zero noise.<br/><br/>Even when streaming video, battery life has not been an issue. I basically just charge this chromebook when I feel like it and have never had to look around for an outlet.<br/><br/>On paper, the travel distance on the keys seems less than ideal. For some reason, though, it's not noticeable to me. I enjoy typing on this keyboard (or else I wouldn't subject myself to typing up this review) although I admit that I'm not sure how Toshiba achieved this. The intangibles of design, I suppose.<br/><br/>There are weaknesses to consider. Toshiba has done a great job making this look and feel like a premium laptop, but I've found that the trackpad is just clicky enough and the hand-rest warms up just enough to remind me that I spent around $300 on this laptop. The part of the laptop with the screen bends, which was initially disconcerting but ultimately has not affected my experience. Obviously, you should also consider the limitations of Chrome OS. The operating system does exactly what I need it to do, which is web browsing and occasional word processing. (Aside: download the Google Docs app for your smartphone and experience the bliss of productivity on-the-go.)<br/><br/>Overall, the Toshiba Chromebook 2 is a great little laptop. You should consider whether this sleek, quiet and speedy little beast meets your needs before shelling out for a "premium" laptop that you may not enjoy as much.
First off let me say that it’s a perfectly decent laptop. I bought it for to take notes and do homework for college, and it works great. It boots in the promised 7 seconds (holy cow that’s so fast!), and it’s better at staying connected to weak wifi networks than my 2010 MacBook.<br/>That being said, i have some problems with it.<br/>First off, while it boasts a 1080p display, when you set the display to 1080p everything becomes very small. I know this is not necessarily Toshiba’s fault, but it’s an annoyance. Also, I know it’s really easy to change the screen resolution, but I purchased a 1080p computer to look at a 1080p display, not a 720p one :(<br/>Second, for some reason a blue/purple line has appeared in the middle of my screen. It’s only about an inch long, and most of the time I can’t see it, but whenever I scroll past something dark or black, or watch TV or movies, it’s very visible.<br/>Third, the keyboard feels a little bit cheap. I know I’m coming from working on a MacBook for years and years, but the keyboard just simply doesn’t have the same satisfying feel as my MacBook did. But it’s a good keyboard, and does everything a keyboard is supposed and expected to do.<br/>Fourth, it doesn’t have support for HBOGO. I know this is mostly HBO’s fault, but still it’s very very annoying.<br/>Fifth, it doesn’t perform very well on websites like squarespace that require a lot of computing power, which is kind of a bummer because I have to use squarespace a lot and it’s very difficult when everything is glitchy and slow.<br/>I feel like I started writing this with a lot more complaints than I’ve written so far. Oh well.<br/><br/>Anyways, I really like the laptop, and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a laptop on a budget. I know I just said a few negative things about it, but other than what I said above I really like it. It’s incredibly fast, the screen is bright, the speakers are really good, it charges very quickly, and it holds a charge for SO LONG!!! Like seriously, sometimes I won’t have to charge it for a few days, as long as I don’t stream video.
I did fairly extensive research on various Chromebooks before I ended up purchasing this Toshiba Chromebook 2; and let me tell you I couldn't be happier.<br/><br/>The display is beautiful (better than any other Chromebook I looked at by far). The build size is just right, not too big but still big enough. Also I love ChromeOS -- it doesn't work for everyone but if you're one of the people that it fits what you need and do, stop hesitating and get one! It's just the little things that google has put into it, that make it so nice (simple things like 3 finger swipe to change tabs, or 2 finger swipe to go back or forward). Also coming from a former windows guy, all those annoying F1-12 keys that I never used are switched out for ones that I use constantly. The main complaint I've seen of this model is the battery life. While I haven't exactly timed it out and tested it, in my use it seems to do really quite well in that department. No complaints from me.<br/><br/>I only have one negative about this chromebook -- the trackpad. It's not terrible, but I think it should be smoother and less "matte-ish." There's just a little too much friction for your finger for super smooth mouse movement. Also it makes kind of a cheap sounding noise when you actually click down on it (I usually just tap anyway so not that big of a deal to me). My last gripe about it, is that at least on mine, the trackpad is not completely level. The bottom right side is slightly more lifted than the opposing corner. With all that said, this is mostly me being really critical. It still is better than many I've used before and works well. Not to mention I think it's in the perfect sweet spot on the device itself.<br/><br/>My main caveats before purchasing would:<br/>1) Research what a chromebook can and can't do. What they can do, they excel at; and I personally will never go back. But they are still limited. Don't be that person who doesn't look up what its limits are and then complain about it not doing what it was never made to do.<br/>2) Know that you're spending significantly less on this device, so don't expect Apple craftsmanship. Those devices are well over a grand. This is made with cheaper materials, that's how you can get this beauty while only paying $300. I will say though, you get a lot out of those $300.<br/><br/>Overall, great display, great build, good battery life, great portability, great OS.
I do a ton of text editing for work -- I edit and publish about 50 articles a week -- and I'm also mobile a fair amount. My Lenovo notebook worked well, but it's a 17" monster with a 2.5hr battery life. It just isn't portable.<br/><br/>The Toshiba Chromebook is exactly what I was hoping it would be. It rivals my girlfriend's MacBook -- it looks just as good and navigates 99% of my uses perfectly. The only thing I don't use it for is image editing (though I could for resizing and cropping).<br/><br/>I'm not kidding -- this probably is the best dollar for dollar purchase I've made in 10 years of business. It's portable, it's built solidly, the keyboard is comfortable and there are very few negatives.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>-- The display is AMAZING. I love watching HD media on this. It's sharp and I can't come close to a complaint. Pretty amazing at this price point!<br/><br/>-- Light, but solid. The build quality is good. I've had it about two months, so I can't speak to long-term use, but I imagine that by the time this thing wears out it'll be obsolete.<br/><br/>-- The speed is very good. Everything I do is web-based and I never have to wait in a way that frustrates me.<br/><br/>CONS (Minor, but they exist):<br/><br/>-- The caps lock key being replaced by the Google/Chrome search button took me some getting used to, but every computer has its quirks.<br/><br/>-- I'm a professional text editor, so I'd love a delete button and home/end keys. I thought it was going to be difficult not having those, but really, I don't mind anymore.<br/><br/>-- I wish the power plug wasn't so thin. I like the tiny power brick and thin cord, but the plug's interface with the machine could be a bit more robust and with less wiggle. I've never disconnected accidentally or bent it, so my complaint isn't based on a real problem.<br/><br/>Conclusion: I am very seriously considering ordering a couple of these for my writers to use as a dedicated work computer. It's amazing for almost every one of my daily work and personal needs.
Great machine - Google Chrome coupled with the Toshiba CB35-B3340 is a pure delight to use:<br/> - Fast<br/> - Terrific Graphics and Sound for a laptop<br/> - Easy to use and/or learn new features<br/> - Professional Look & Feel while being light weight<br/> - Admirable battery life & recharges relatively fast<br/><br/>Admittedly, I have not done a side-by-side comparison with other similarly configured Chromebooks, but out of the box this machine far exceeded my expectations having witnessed some clunky Chromebook performance on older machines. I can pretty much live in the cloud for browsing, email, photo viewing, video chats and music. For what I do, I prefer to have a decent desktop machine back-end my environment, but that said, I can use this Chromebook very effectively for well over 90% of my needs, and it's nicely portable.<br/><br/>Typically, I have 6 - 10 tabs open simultaneously without noticing a lag in performance. As one would suspect, overall performance is highly correlated to the speed and quality of the WiFi connection. Great touch & feel on the keyboard - far better than several laptops I've used from Dell & Apple. Great range on Bluetooth; have tested over 40 feet thru walls without a problem/interference. Connected a low-end USB mouse (touch-pads are tools of the devil), and it worked without issue. Google has done an admirable job creating Chrome & peripheral software, and Toshiba has done an equally admirable effort exploiting Chrome's capabilities.<br/><br/>Not much to criticize here. Technology tools leapfrog so for the current world, I strongly prefer this machine over a tablet if only because of ease and speed of typing plus price. Cost? Intuitively, my sense is that it's a bit overpriced but still well worth the money. There's been some criticism from some reviewers with regard to performance accessing large PDF's. Using the IRS 1040 Instructions as a benchmark, I did not have this experience, i.e., worked fine and as good as my desktop machine; besides there's apparently an ap available. As with all Chromebooks no WiFi = not all that useful.<br/><br/>All-up: This is a keeper. I'm completely satisfied.
Great Chromebook.  No question, the screen is the best aspect of this Toshiba, however, all aspects are very good.  I'm coming from the original Samsung Chromebook.  Google Drive benefit ran out - and the Samsung now has lots of wear and tear - passing it on. Also use Android tablets, Kindle HDX and Windows.  First Toshiba product I have ever purchased.<br/><br/>  Tried out the new Acer 13 inch 4 Gb with the Tegra Processor.  I think there was more power - but the screen cannot compare.  Also a bit heavier. Also, want at least one Intel based  Chromebook for Linux.  Don't know if Intel is all that mandatory, but I do use peripherals, so I feel safer with the Intel.<br/><br/>  Keyboard is great.  Could use a little more depth - but if you use a light touch, it's great.  I'm a piano player, so I am used to using different amounts of pressure with my fingers.  Trackpad is huge and works well.<br/><br/>  I ran the computer streaming Netflix, Hulu Plus and Amazon Video, You Tube with a few open browsers.  For the most part, everything ran well; a little stuttering here and there.  Hulu is always the best test.  The laptop did get quite warm in the middle towards the screen, but hey - it was working overtime.  In normal use, it gets every so slightly warm (does get quite warm when charging though if in use, and the charger gets hot - the charger portion itself - not the attachment to the laptop.<br/><br/>  I am not going to get into a "What is Chrome OS discusion" - but I would mention that I really do prefer Google Docs to Microsoft 365 on line.  I am not talking about the Microsoft Word, etc. online app that you can use free with the Chromebook.  I'm talking about the Microsoft 365 subscription (comes free for one year with many Windows products).  I use Google Docs  Office for work and personal use.  I also have Microsoft 365.  Amazingly, Google Docs is much more fluid and faster.  I am sure some people reading this would think I am crazy, but I have been using both side by side and I can say that Google Docs works for me much better.  And I use many features as well as to download into different file formats, including pdf, html, docx.  I also use Libre Office as a downloaded app on my Windows machines, but I have to say, I really have come to prefer Google Docs, even to that.<br/><br/>  I am interested in the new 11.6 inch Asus with the Rockchip Processor (4gb), for the smaller size Chromebook, but that will be another story, and I will wait for a good deal (was $189 - just went back up to $199).<br/><br/>  This Toshiba has the best by far Chromebook screen on the market.  And much better than many of the windows laptops on the lower end and medium end.  And that is not by a margin.  This screen is amazing - all angles - horizontal and vertical are great - resolution is fantastic.  Don't forget, you can lower resolution in the Display Settings and you can control Zoom with CTRL + or -.<br/><br/>  Right now, this Chromebook comes with a free $30 Amazon Gift Card.  It's a little tricky to facilitate the benefit.  So, I went to my Kindle HDX Mayday button, and Amazon got me through it.
This computer will not connect to my modem.Verizon replace the modem with a new one on sept.4th 2015 and their customer could not get it to connect.Now I'm stuck with a computer that I cannot return.Thanks Amazon.Robert monheim  at Monheir@yahoo.com
This is a perfect machine for me!  I haven't even begun to test it's capability.  I use it for internet access & social media mostly....but it offers so much more....just need time to explore.<br/>It is so light weight...great traveling with it.
Love my chromebook!  Perfect size and fabulous screen resolution.  My only complaint is that the user interface is quite small.  This can be overcome, however, by enlarging image (control+).  Sound quality is more than decent for watching movies.
I was looking to replace my broken Sony VAIO, and wanted to give chromebook a try. I primarily used my VAIO for browsing the internet, skype and watching movies, so I thought I could do with a chromebook. I was so right! I still miss my Windows 7 laptop a little, but not a whole lot ;)<br/><br/>I realized computers could have been so much better after using my chromebook. There is no start-up, shut-down nonsense -- You open your laptop and in about a minute you are logged in. When you are done, you close your laptop and it sleeps. Press the power key on the top right corner and you are logged out; Press it a little longer you have switched off your laptop. You don't have to put up with -- The operating system is loading, please give us 5 minutes of your life-- crap. Seriously, why weren't computers like this all the time?<br/><br/>I used to have all those annoying malware programs infecting my windows laptop all the time. I would then download anti-malware, anti-virus and anti-crap ware, to a point where the browser is barely limping along. None of that with the chromebook! All I want to do 90% of the time is open my browser and look something up, and that is exactly what my chromebook lets me do; with zero intrusion. I cannot begin to explain how this simplification by Google engineers has changed my life. If you are like me, and find yourself using the browser most of the time -- do yourself a favor and buy a chromebook.<br/><br/>This Toshiba make of the chromebook, comes with a gorgeous IPS display. HD videos play fine and I can use the HDMI output to feed my TV. The TV comes on as an external display, and continues to run even if I close the lid! The brightness adjustment key (Yes! they got rid of those ancient top-row function keys and replaced them with keys that make sense) lets you go all the way down to switch off your display. This is a great feature for me, because sometimes I am listening to music and would rather switch my display off and save battery life. There are keys for full-screen, app switching and volume adjustment in place of function keys. If you wanted your function keys back, you could reconfigure and get them back.<br/><br/>The laptop itself has no moving parts, which is a great improvement. It has a solid-state-drive (SSD) for a hard drive, so there are no creak-creak noises. No fan, no hum. The chassis has no vents, which makes it easy to clean and maintain. Even without any vents, the laptop doesn't heat up as much and the speaker is loud enough! Great work here Toshiba!<br/><br/>I did consider buying a tablet to replace my PC, but tablets wouldn't be able to browse my external HDD, or share pictures from my camera. Having a touch-screen could've been cooler, but I don't need it really.<br/><br/>The price point at which the chromebook allows me to do what I have been begrudgingly doing with my ~$600 windows laptop, makes me ecstatic. At this price, the chromebook also beats all the good tablets out there. I feel like my money had suddenly become much more valuable!<br/><br/>Although I am very happy with my purchase, I do have some gripes about this product --<br/><br/>- This is a chromebook, and not windows. Although I don't use my laptop for anything other than browsing for 90% of the time, I did have the ability to install a vast array of third-party programs. Giving that up was a bit of an adjustment of life-style, but I was ok with it. One good example is Skype. I had to switch to hangouts and ask my callers to switch too. I was also not able to play all my old videos from my external HDD, as the chromebook doesn't support playing them. Had this been windows, I could have installed a program to do this.<br/><br/>- When waking up or starting up, chrome tries to reload all the previously open tabs, and this seems to kill the internet connection. My wireless network shows up as connected, but pages would actually report "connection lost". Then I close all the tabs and open one-by-one.<br/><br/>- I find the web cam quality to be horrible (-1 star). Even with good lighting the picture quality takes me at least 10 years back. I don't understand why Toshiba managed to build such a good quality laptop and throw in a nasty web cam. I am used to Facetime with my iPhone and I find the camera in the laptop absolutely horrible.<br/><br/>- Hangouts has echo issues when using external speakers. It gets annoying when you are using hangouts and your callers hear their echo. I get by with using headphones, but I think this could've been better.
I purchased this laptop as an attempt to fill the void left by my dearly departed Macbook Pro.  Yes, I could have purchased a new Macbook, but I'm not all that devoted to Apple OS and I wanted to save some green.  It is impossible to compare the two, so I won't try to do that.  Rather, I'll let the Chromebook stand on its own merit.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Build quality is nice.  The laptop feels sturdy and there is very little of the 'lid wiggle' that is characteristic of cheap laptops.<br/>-ChromeOS has a nice array of apps for getting work done. Obviously, if you are heavily involved in video/audio/photo editing, look elsewhere.  As a simple typer and light photo editor, assuming you can fit on the keyboard (see cons) this machine will do nicely.<br/>-The screen is nice -- far nicer than expected.  Full screen 1080p video's look nice (provided you're not doing anything else -- see cons).<br/>-Great startup times and snappy performance for the casual user.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-ChromeOS.  It still has a ways to go.  While it can do many of the tasks associated with a traditional PC, I find it unattractive and off putting to do everything out of a browser window.  This was surprising, honestly.  I could get work done, but I ended up hating the intangibles of the experience. A handful of apps have standalone windows.<br/>-Keyboard.  The key travel was too shallow for my liking and my average-sized-male-hands had a hard time fitting on this keyboard and typing comfortably.<br/>-Touchpad.  Nice texture, but it felt cheap.  This was easily the component with the worst build quality.  I frequently thought I was going to break it or thought it was already broken.<br/>-Sound.  The sound quality was weird and distorted toward the low end.  I'm not an audiophile, but it was a problem for me.<br/>-Performance.  Generally good, but noticeably slow in places.  I found that HD video required me to close all other tabs for performance without stuttering.  For an OS with a small footprint, I was surprised at how much of the available 4gb of ram was used at any given time.<br/><br/>Overall, this Chromebook was about what I expected for a few hundred dollars. There were too many little things that drove me mad while using it.  Hopefully the next iteration will improve things.  Like everyone, I suppose, I have certain expectations for a computing experience, and this laptop didn't quite get there.  It was close though. I wanted to like it, but I didn't.<br/><br/> As other reviewers have noted, this is a great machine for a casual user, but if you're a professional looking for a working computer, even for typing, this (or any) Chromebook may require more compromises than you are comfortable with.
I'll skip the 'what is a Chromebook' bit and jump straight to the fact that to get a lightweight laptop with long battery life & budget price means that you need to use low energy processors, and so if you go into Chromebook ownership aware of the inherent compromises you tend to have low expectations. The Toshiba Chromebook 2 with 4GB of RAM and HD screen excels in almost every area and goes well beyond what most people expect from a Chromebook. I upgraded from an 18 month old HP Chromebook 11, a computer I was generally very happy with, but which was starting to be overwhelmed by those compromises that I'd convinced myself I could live with. Eventually a combination of speed issues and flagging battery life prompted the move to the Toshiba. This is a great Chromebook, and certainly the best I've used (including the very expensive Pixel). The silver finish looks a little cheap, but the textured surface makes it comfortable to grip and build quality is very good, with minimal flex, and the keyboard has a very comfortable and firm action. Battery life seems to deliver a genuine full day of use, averaging around the 6 - 7 hour mark, and charging is fast. The Skullcandy tuned speakers are certainly loud, but audio quality from the small speakers beneath the keyboard can only deliver so much depth and the resulting sound is a little tinny, that said, audio processing delivers a very rich sound via headphones. The Intel chip delivers very speedy and stable performance, with noticeably smooth scrolling, video playback and carries multiple browsing tabs with ease. Of course, if you keep opening tabs filled with rich content things will start to slow down, but it handles general browsing without issue. The screen is fantastic - it is bright with excellent viewing angles and of such high definition that some text content can appear so small as to be hard to read. This is easy to remedy using CTRL + and CTRL - you can instantly increase or decrease the size of web content (reset the page with CTRL 0). Overall this is a very high quality Chromebook, and the first I've used that feels like a 'real' laptop computer. Highly recommended.
The screen is brilliant and fantastic.  I read a lot of reviews about the different Chromebooks, and this Toshiba is definitely the best overall Chromebook out there as of today's date.  Highly recommended if you are thinking about a Chromebook.
After doing a long research it was between this one and the Dell, i ended up getting the Toshiba because the screen is amazing! it is a great Chromebook and the price is right. This Chromebook was rated #1 by the Verge and i trust their reviews.
I've had this chromebook for about a month now, and here's some things I've noticed that I wished someone had told me before I bought it.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>-Gorgeous little full-HD IPS display. Seriously, it's a joy to watch movies on here.<br/>-Instant startup upon opening the lid is awesome. It's great to know you can close it up, move around, and reopen the device without having to wait.<br/>-This thing is pretty light. Light enough to hold in one hand, or pinch between two fingers if you wanted to.<br/>-The ability to do Remote Access to your desktop is so so useful.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>-The wireless internet on this thing is surprisingly weak. For a machine that's built to do NOTHING ELSE but to USE THE INTERNET, you would think that would do better at that. But alas, loading webpages is slow, opening new links is slow. Even scrolling down pages is sometimes slow--it skips and jumps at times. Swapping to a faster network helps, but when compared side-by-side to my five-year-old laptop, the laptop handles everything with far more ease, with a much zippier browsing experience. I constantly feel the chromebook struggling to complete simple tasks.<br/>-Suprisingly, the chromebook handles youtube videos the worst. Videos will skip and jump, pausing every so often. Thankfully, the problem doesn't arrive on netflix videos, but it's infuriating to browse Youtube. You would think that a OS built by Google would be better at handling a Google site.<br/>-Battery life is purported to be nine hours, and it definitely felt like that at first. Soon, I found that the battery started draining rapidly. I searched for solutions to this, and users recommended turning off your chromebook completely and charging for a few hours. Even when doing this the battery life only lasts 6 hours now.<br/>-CHROME OS WILL NOT PLAY AC3 AUDIO. Apparently there's something in the OS that just makes it impossible to play this file type. That means that if you decide to hook up a hard drive to watch some .mkv movies on your gorgeous IPS display, you'll have to get really good at reading lips because you're not going to hear anything. THIS is something I wish I had known before purchasing this device, because I definitely bought it with the intention of using it's display for some movie watching, and this chromebook is severely limited in that regard.<br/><br/>DESIGN FLAWS<br/>-The screen doesn't tilt back all the way, much like a macbook. While this is fine and all, it really does limit your viewing options. Also, pushing the screen back just to be stopped so suddenly feels like you're breaking the hinge every time.<br/>-The touchpad honestly feels kind of cheap--it tries to be like a macbook's touchpad, but instead feels thinner, rougher, and a bit more unresponsive.<br/>-No caps lock.<br/><br/>All in all, I love the quick startup, the screen, the weight, and the ability to type something without feeling like it's burning up my lap. However, this chromebook is handicapped as a movie-watching device, fails at playing youtube, and sluggishly browses the web as opposed to Windows laptops within the same price range. This is a good device to take quick notes or to use for light web browsing, but don't expect much more out of it. All in all, you're probably better off buying a normal laptop.
I love the the computer! I would honestly give it 5 stars... It's light and weightless, the google system is easy to use online or offline. The screen is amazing and the keys feel wonderful. You wouldn't think it was a 280$ laptop.<br/><br/>My only problem with it is that it CAN NOT connect to the my school's wifi... I am a CUNY student and this chromebook, well the Chrome OS system is not compatible with the CUNY internet/wifi service..<br/>What is the point for me to have bought this? Despite the beautiful screen and amazing sound, if I would have known that this device or any CHROME OS device could not connect to the internet/wifi of the CUNY institutions... I would not have purchased this device. Like I can't even connect to optimum wifi!<br/>If this is supposed to be a internet based device it is failing! Like I would honestly give it 1 star just because of the false advertisement... If its an internet/wifi based system it should not have any problems connecting to the internet and wifi!<br/>Luckily at home I can download all the files I need for class but like what if I want to watch a video or listen to music? Or do something online? Offline is pretty boring on a chromebook and its pointless.<br/><br/>Its manageable, I haven't had a major issue with it at school and it works wonderfully at home but honestly... no optimum wifi??????? If I can not connect this system to optimum wifi through technical support I WILL RETURN THIS LIGHT WEIGHT CONFUSED SYSTEM!<br/><br/>So I guess 5 stars for the actual chromebook<br/>1 star for the CHROME OS SYSTEM < Due to it NOT being able to connect to all internet/wifi system<br/><br/>BEWARE CUNY COLLEGE STUDENTS!!!!!
Absolutely love the Chromebook. Starts up in a few seconds.  Bought one for myself and within a couple of months bought a second one for my son.  He loves how much faster it is than his old laptop.  I would definitely recommend this laptop.
I have the FullHD IPS model. It's sleek, sexy, silent, but slow.<br/>Good:<br/>Screen is one of the best I've seen, on par with Sony screens. However, chrome os doesn't scale yet which really sucks.<br/>Keyboard is as good as any other chromebook and feels like a mac.<br/>Speakers are great. Doesn't sound like a normal laptop.<br/>Trackpad clicks almost everywhere, so that's good I guess but I don't usually click by pressing down.<br/>I can't believe how LIGHT this thing is.<br/>Bad:<br/>The design is a half measure. It almost looks like they took a page out of samsung's book and put dimples all over the top and bottom covers. Overall it is nice and minimal though.<br/>The fanless design sounds like a good idea, but it gets too hot to leave on my lap.<br/>The lack of fans also means the processor gets bottlenecked to avoid overheating, which means this thing is slow. Videos skip frames. Stuff takes way too long to load. Half the time it can't load youtube, the other half it takes it like 20 seconds to load a page. I'd rather have a machine that has a fan but doesn't use it unless it needs it. My Sony Vaio Duo 13 gen 2 does this. It's almost always silent but when it needs to boost up, it can. Toshiba should add fans in between the top of the keyboard and the edge of the device so it doesn't blow hot air on you.<br/>Trackpad is not up to par. It's big but textured, which A) feels bad and B) is going to get worn away over time and look bad.<br/>Trackpad is sunken in from the platform/wrist rest. This leaves a sharp edge which is undesirable. The HP chromebook 14 has a smooth transition at the edges which, I didn't realize it but now that it's gone, apparently I love.<br/><br/>I think i'll sell it on ebay and buy a nexus 9 and never look back
HDMI port failed 2 months in. Unable to run multiple instances of flash after month three. Screws keep falling out the bottom. Operated at original speed for only 2 months of use. Basically useless to me after 4 months of ownership.
First chromebook ever and I'm digging it, few things I haven't figured out yet such as wallpaper, I know its probably easy to change but hey, browsing the Web is super quick along with startup. Can't believe I didn't have one before
Great value and very easy to use.
Love it for web surfing. There has definitely been a learning curve going from MS to Google but that is on me. For the money you get a great machine with 200g of cloud storage. Product was exactly as described. Quick delivery.
At first I was a bit disappointed with the build quality... But then I realized that the Chromebook will never match my xps. I'm in love now, and only use my xps for CPU intensive tasks. Side loading android apps is clutch!
I was looking for a laptop for school, since I use google docs this was my best fit and it came with 1tb of storage in google!!!  Keyboard is very responsive as well as the touch pad.  Very Very Very happy with my purchase!
This laptop came quickly, was extremely simple to operate/intuitive in function and meets my needs as a computer that is used primarily for entertainment purposes, searching the web, watching films etc. Zero complaints.
Have this laptop for college and it is amazing. It holds up really well for a chromebook. If you're a college student looking for an affordable laptop look no further and get this one. You will not be disappointed.
Only complaints are that the touch pad is terrible. The right click is so terrible that I just use a mouse all the time.  Also the sound has issues sometimes, and I have to reset the computer settings to fix it.
What a fantastic laptop and OS!. Boots up in seconds making it our "go to device" for almost everything. The screen is wonderful and the size  and weight make it a pleasure to use. Highly recommend it .
If all you need to do is get online/watch netflix/youtube/"onlline stuff"  this laptop is absolutely amazing.....price, speed, light weight, speedy, slim, gorgeous display!!!!! couldnt be happier!!!
This is hands down the greatest chromebook of all time, would have this 10 times out of 10 over a pixel. It broke sadly, so a I got an Asus because it was cheaper, miss it everyday. GET THIS LAPTOP!
An amazing laptop with an amazing screen. Definitely worth the HD upgrade. It lacks the same functionality as a windows laptop though. Just make sure your connected with the internet most of the time.
I've been searching and searching for a new laptop that fulfilled my needs and wants. I already have a laptop with an i7 processor and 16GB of RAM. The only problem with it? It's heavy. I'm a student and such a heavy laptop isn't practical. I looked at macbook's pro and air and both fitted what I needed but I can't justify spending $1000+ right now as a college student. What I was looking for was something light, something for browsing the web, for my online classroom canvas, and video watching. This chromebook does it ALL with an absolutely beautiful display, 1920 is gorgeous(if it's too small for you, YOU CAN change it!) I'm writing this review firstly as a student as that's the main reason for me purchasing this chromebook. The weight is perfect, the 13 inch display is perfect, the processor as many people have pointed out isn't perfect, but as far as chromebooks go, this will blow the others out of the water. It's fanless, silent, and never heats up to an unreasonable temperature. As for the one star reviews complaining about the screens breaking, I literally accidentally threw my chromebook while in my backpack into the seat in my car and nothing bad happened. If you're looking for something light, this Toshiba chromebook 2 will eliminate your laptop and your tablet. If you're considering buying one but don't know, go play with it in person at your local BestBuy, then buy it on Amazon.
This a great value for the money.  The computer has a great screen.  I watch a lot of Netflix on it, and the picture and sound quality are great.  They keyboard is comfortable and easy to use.
EDIT: After 6 months I can add a reliability report: EXCELLENT!<br/>Also easily installed linux chroot on it, it's great, smooth.<br/><br/>If you're not too tied to Office and Photoshop, it's simple: BUY THIS! Best deal right now.<br/><br/>Overall, awesome! Good value for retail price, but I ought mine on Black Friday 2014 for $300 from BB. If that price ever returns, steal it! At around $400, buy it!<br/><br/>(Just that you know where I'm coming from, I had a modest Windows 11.6 HP m3105, amd-based 8GB laptop).<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>+ Fanless (I didn't think it'll matter, but it does)<br/>+ As everyone mentions, screen. 1080P! (why do most chromebooks and laptops have 1366x768 I wouldn't know)<br/>+ Trackpad: just works and works fine (I do miss double tap to click and drag though)<br/>+ I only have this laptop for 4 days, but battery life looks great so far<br/>+ Performance: so far so good. Very acceptable for me.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- I do think that Windows' looks is more polished. Chromebook's visuals and fonts look like Linux. if you're curious, test a usb based linux on your laptop to see. Couldn't find yet a why to install MSFT's set of fonts (times, arial, etc.)<br/>- Keyboard and trackpad take getting used to. (no functions keys, no double tap to drag, NO PG DOWN KEY!)<br/>- only 2 usb ports<br/>- Couldn't control my logitech mouse (set the resolution) like I can on windows<br/><br/>None of the cons mandate deducting any stars.<br/><br/>I have yet to switch this machine to developer mode and play with other os (linux).
I bought this laptop for my daughter and she is very pleased. She is really impressed with the resolution and light weight feel. Very easy for her to carry around in her backpack for school.
I've had this Chromebook for about a week now and I'm extremely satisfied. The HD display is amazing. I've watched a couple videos on it from Hulu and Amazon Prime, and its clarity is stunning and I experienced no choppiness in the playback. As for browser performance, I've been able to keep about 8 tabs open without issue. I've browsed various sites, checked mail, read PDFs, watched videos, etc. without issue. Occasionally, I do see the WiFi connection go from excellent to good or even poor, but I'm not sure if it's a problem with the Chromebook or with my network or router. Nonetheless, it's a minor issue and it hasn't happened too frequently.<br/><br/>For $300 you really can't beat this device. My only complaints are that it does feel a little cheesy when you hold it, but I think that's just the type of plastic used. Typing is not a problem on this keyboard and the trackpad is good, but not great. I've had a MacBook for 5 years now and I've really gotten used to the smooth glass of the trackpad, but considering replacing my busted MacBook for over $1000, I can't complain with this $300 purchase. And the 5 second bootup and shutdown are something I'm really getting used to, along with the excellent battery life. My work laptop takes 10 minutes to bootup some days, so I'm sold on using solid-state drives from here on out.
So I held out for like six months before writing a review in fear something would change my mind on this computer, but it's still a winner. It's fast, the screen is beautiful, keyboard layout is super easy to use, and it feels quality. I really like the texture on the surface of the case. It's one of those pieces of technology you want to buy (2) of just in case anything happens to the first one.<br/><br/>Couple things I think someone should have in mind with this computer. One, it's not going to replace your MacBook. If you do any kind of photo editing, video editing, audio work, this will not cut it. That's fine with me. I've got a MacBook, I use the Chromebook 90 percent of the time. All my bookmarks, files, pictures link together with my phone and Google Drive, Documents and all that. I travel with only the Chromebook, I can go through my SD cards of audio, HD video, and RAW photos for review. The only time I break out the MacBook now is to edit or use Final Draft writing software.<br/><br/>The 2nd thing is, if you're not used to Google products yet, it might be a learning curve. But it's worth it. I see everyone else fighting with Internet Explorer, Firefox, I have close to zero issues with Chrome. So if you're not using Gmail, Google Drive, you might want to try those out first before going with a Chromebook like this.
This is horrible. Do not buy. It will not pick up wi-fi and does not have adequate RAM to load any videos sufficiently, be they on Youtube or otherwise. I would I could still return this.
I really like this Chromebook. I use it mainly to work on documents and watching shows. I knew exactly what it's limitations were so I'm happy with what I got.
Computer was bought for sisters 8th birthday. The screen is stunning with videos and movies. It offers good use for the price in a simple but stylish package.
Did a lot of research on this before buying so there weren't many surprises...<br/><br/>Pros<br/>Great screen - sharp, excellent colour and contrast, no issues with glare/reflections<br/>Great battery life - 9 to 11 hours with screen at about 60% brightness<br/>Keyboard and touchpad very similar to the MacBook Air I was using before this.<br/>Runs quiet and cool, will heat up a bit when viewing YouTube, Netflix, or playing a movie.<br/>Solid reliable performance. No issues with day-long use.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Very limited VPN support - can't connect to Microsoft VPNs - this is very frustrating<br/>Difficulty finding an RDP client that works reliably (AccesstoGo by Ericom seems to be the best out there)<br/>No backlight on keyboard - I really miss this coming from the MB Air.<br/>Limited video codec's so playing a movie is hit or miss unless you can re-code it on another machine.<br/><br/>If Google was to get the limited VPN and video codec capabilities rectified this it would be perfect for me.
This is an update to the previous review. I've used the Toshiba CB35-B3340 for about three weeks. It performs fawsley, it is fast and efficient! The battery life is very long, lasting over over eight hours with normal web surfing. The overall quality of the Toshiba Chromebook is very nice, its seems very sturdy. I invested in a iPearle mCover hard shell case, the fit is very good. The Chrome OS is very good, I've connected my portable HD to the machine and it works very well. I've also hooked my iPod up, it will charge the iPod and it will read songs, they are labeled in a strange way... I tried uploading them to Google play and magically they retained their original song names! I have not tried downloading songs from Google Play onto the iPod. There are a lot of Apps available from the web store, The only thing that would be nice is a fully functioning iTunes app. Perhaps its time to migrate away from the iPod. However, I use the iPod in the car.....<br/><br/>This is my first Chromebook...Overall, I love the OS and the format! As a web surfing device this machine is super fast! The Chromebook OS loads so fast, from zero to flying in about six seconds.The battery life on this Toshiba is about 7 to 8 hours with with average web surfing, Pandora, and YouTube...the display is pretty phenomenal. I have to say, during most of my web surfing I tone it down to 1536 X 864 instead of the 1920 x 1080, just because the fonts are to small for my preference. However, with HD videos the display with 1080p is very nice! The Skullcandy sound is very good also, it is a surround sound feel! The Toshiba Chromebook has a good quality feel to it, I love the size of the 13 inch screen, the weight is just right. The only slight hindrance to the overall appreciation of the Toshiba Chromebook is the touch pad... its seems to have a little "click" sound? Like its not seating properly in the case?? I even got a replacement unit. However, it had the same click to it... a minor glitch, that wont become a major factor in performance??
Absolutely incredible Chromebook. It does about 95% of what I normally accomplish on a Windows 7 laptop. The HD IPS screen is absolutely gorgeous. Great buy.
This is the most awesome computer ever.  It is super fast to start, has a great display.  I find that I am on this more than any other computer that I own.
This is perhaps one of the best buys, for the price, I have every made. I just love this laptop! My only disappointments are not being able to get the newer one with the lighted keyboard because I spend a lot of time on my Chromebook in bed. Another disappointment is the quality of the keyboard! I have had my Chromebook for over a month now and, some of the keys are starting to make a slight whistling sound when I type. It is not a deal killer but, it can be a slight distraction! Oh! Another thing! I know that technology moves on but, it is kind of disappointing for me to read that Google is moving to an Android operating system over its Chrome OS in a few years. My Chromebook will be obsolete a year and a half after I bought it. I'm not used to this because I still use an old $200, Acer laptop running Windows 10 and I have had it for over 6 years! It is a little slow but, works fine. It will work better when I increase the ram from 2 GB to 4 GB. When I like a product, I really hold on to it no matter what the mainstream tells me! Ha-ha!
I don't know what people are talking about when they complain about speed. I have no problem with this laptop with multiple applications and tabs running.<br/><br/>UPDATE::<br/>Compared to a top of line processor -- intel i7 -- this chromebook is obviously slower. However, considering the price, it's a solid state device, and it's fanless, it's a very good item. I still give 5 stars.
Okay so this was the first time I bought a Chromebook and if you know what you are getting into and the uses of these type of computers this is a no-brainer. This Chromebook is INCREDIBLE, the battery life, it's size and weight it's 1080p screen, the speakers, just everything is perfect, the only thing it may be missing is a backlit keyboard but that's just me being picky. With this computer you can easily get 6+ hours of battery life or up to 5 if you are watching movies or heavy web browsing, it's super light and portable so you can take it with you wherever you go, just take into account that in order to get the most outta it you need a steady internet connection and I highly recommend to use all Google's enviroment (Drive, Photos, GMail, etc...), in addition to all this you have an HDMI output in case you want to plug it to a bigger screen, one USB 3.0, one USB 2.0 an a SD card reader that made my life so much easier.<br/>Bottom line: If you need a portable, well made and a computer just for text editing, web browsing and watching a movie from time to time THIS IS IT!
Screen broke by itself (literally closed it and opened it next morning). Searching online, apparently screen damage is not covered by warranty.
This Chromebook was great for the first months of use. Great battery life, stunning display, fast... and then I started getting purple lines and splotches on the screen.<br/><br/>No problem! It is still under warranty so I just called customer service.. After an hour of being on hold I'm told to send it in to their Repair Depot. The disconcerting thing is, I have to pay for shipping and if the repair "experts" decide that it is caused by physical damage they can just send it back to me unfixed. Okay, well I've never dropped or damaged my chromebook in anyway, so I figure it is still worth.<br/><br/>Well, Toshiba wants $30 to ship it out to them. Almost 10% of the cost of the product just to get a chance of getting it repaired. No thanks! Seriously what kind of company charges you to ship our products when they are UNDER WARRANTY and they are caused by the MANUFACTURER. I should not have to pay an extra $30 just so that my Chromebook display, WHICH IS THE MAIN SELLING POINT OF THIS CHROMEBOOK, works.
Great Chromebook. Perfect for shcool. Keyboard is great, screen is clear and crisp, sount quality is awesome,  and it is just an overall great laptop.
I got my Toshiba Chromebook and love it. I had a Samsung Chromebook from last year and it died on me and found this one on the Toshiba site after I read some reviews and have to say this is a nice laptop. I like the look, the feel and the screen is wonderful. Just so you know because it is a full HD screen some of the sites the fonts and all will appear rather small. Easy to eleveate by hitting the ctrl and + sign (or - for smaller). I like the feel of this machine and it does what I need it to do. I do not use it for a lot of office stuff but google provides that if I need it. Truly I am happy with this laptop and even commented that it reminds me of an Apple Air but without the cost. Keyboard and track screen work great. And at this time buy it from Toshiba since mid December Amazon has been selling it for 379.00 and retail at Toshiba is $329.00. You may have to wait a little while like I did (3 weeks) to get this laptop but well worth it. Pleased with my purchase and thankfully I do not have to deal with all the bugs and viruses found on windows machines.
I wanted a cheap notebook that I could keep around the house or toss in my bag to go to a coffee shop. I own a 2011 MacBook Air that's feeling its age, so I wanted something comparable. I knew exactly what I was getting into with ChromeOS. Running just a browser is all I really wanted. Long battery life is important to me.<br/><br/>I tried other Chromebooks but the displays compared to the MacBook Air were not even close. The Toshiba Chromebook 2 caught my eye due to its IPS display, which is what's found in most Macs. To cut to the chase, the display is gorgeous. Well worth the $100 premium over other Chromebooks. It's bright, with rich colors and great viewing angles. The Bay Trail processor is slower than the Haswell processors found in other Chromebooks but for my use cases (browsing, email, video) I have not complained once.<br/><br/>I  knock a star off my review because of the build quality. Don't get me wrong, for a $300 notebook it is solid, my concern is the display hinges which feel fragile and have a limited range of movement.
This is truly a great product that puts Windows on notice. So much smarter than Windows 8 or 10. Lives up to what is stated in the advertisement.
Man i love it! I love it! I never expect too much from laptops but this is my first chromebook and i love it! Everything from it is just PERFECT!
So I got the Toshiba 13.3" Chromebook 2 in today.<br/><br/>First a little history about me, I was a Pixel owner who gave it up because of the horrible battery life (literally 2-3 hours). I purchased a 13" Macbook Pro Retina last November and have been running ever since. I prefer ChromeOS to OSX, so I have been waiting for a revamped Pixel to launch to switch back over. In the meantime this Toshiba gets announced and I thought I would give it a try.<br/><br/>The new Toshiba is impressive in so many ways. Someone mentioned in another review, that the screen is not as good as the Macbook Air and they are wrong (tried that first, before going to Pro Retina). IPS is a whole other level that a TN panel cannot match. HP got it right with the Chromebook 11 (first version), they just put a awful processor in it. Toshiba has been one of the few (if not the only), to finally answer our complaints and stick a beautiful higher resolution screen with a semi-beautiful design. Initially, I did find the text small... Read more
I love this chromebook! I have used desktops, laptops, tablets, Mac, and PC. This thing is so light and quick to respond - its the perfect size for personal use. I think there's a fan but i never hear it; it doesn't get so hot i feel like my legs are on fire like with some laptops! It starts right up, was easy to personalize and Google Drive et. al. is very easy to figure out if you don't already use it. My phone pics are synced up immediately with the computer. If you are looking for a fairly inexpensive but solid computer - this is the way to go! No bloatware, not slow start up, no loud fans or hot computer. Just remember this is a Chromebook, which means everything runs off of the "cloud" - so you need internet to access most things (however you can set up your cloud docs etc... to be available offline) But you can't install software on this computer. That being said - there are tons of apps and extensions for nearly anything you want - games, productivity, reading, etc...<br/>i love this thing. love it.
I use a full featured business notebook PC all day, every day but I wanted an inexpensive, lightweight, full keyboard, notebook-like device with a reasonable screen for lighter stuff like email, web surfing, home entertainment functions, light word processing. I was prepared to completely hate a "wimpy" Chromebook however this completely does the tasks listed above and the screen far, far surpasses anything else in the price range at time of purchase (no idea if things have since changed with displays). There are occasional hangs when viewing Amazon videos and the sound from time to time disappears also in the Amazon video viewer. I have no idea whether root cause is the Chromebook hardware, Chrome, Amazon viewer, Amazon streaming service or even a quirk in my WIFI but I suspect it is a viewer problem. Regardless, a quick log-off, log-on resolves the issue. On balance I like it a lot and use it constantly rather than lugging a 6 lb notebook PC around while not at work.
This is a great labtop for basic internet use. The HD screen is Beautiful and clear. The best screen I have seen. I use to have an Acer.
so easy, so quick, just be aware that the font is very small, although one can adjust it by reducing the screen resolution, which works.
I really like the screen, sound is good too. Build quality has been perfect and battery life has been great.<br/>Well worth the price.
I recently got one of these Chrome--Books and think it is very good---I am not used to it yet but as I use it I like it more every day
Lightweight, portable, easy interface.  Love the quick charge on the battery but the long life once charged.  Met all my expectations.
QUALITY VS DESIGN:<br/>PROS: All of the things you hear about this Chromebook are true.  Beautiful screen, nice design, pretty and functional dimpled cover, very good keyboard.  Everything you can see and feel is good stuff.<br/>CONS: The first one I got was DOA.....plugged it in, started up and then after 25 seconds later it flashed off.  My second CON is it took two people and 1:25 - a full 85 minutes - to determine the product was dead.<br/><br/>Here is the best part.  During that 85 minutes I spoke with Amazon.  Took 4 minutes to get someone on the phone.  A very helpful person walked me through a few basic things like holding down the power button for 20 seconds to try to reset it.  We agreed it was dead so they gave me free return shipping and we ordered a new one.<br/><br/>I hope that the second one will be better than the first.  Will let you know in 2 days.  It is <$300 so I will give them the benefit of the doubt.
For the price, this is one of the best computers I have ever purchased.  Had never been pleased with any laptop I had ever owned so I decided to try a Chromebook now that I am out of school and generally only use to browse the internet, check email, and occasionally watch a movie.  So far I am impressed, for simple tasks this is a fast machine and has a good battery life.  The only downside so far is that running MS word and excel on the chrome browser is inconvenient but I think that is a well known and expected downside when choosing a Chromebook.  I was initially concerned with the device being "cheap" as I read a lot of reviews where people reported that the screen broke easily.  I don't know what they are talking about, the device seems pretty solid to me.  I actually dropped it off a table already and it still works fine...not that I recommend that.
Others have already adequately described this laptop's positive characteristics, so I'll focus on one issue.<br/><br/>TL;DR The screws are loose<br/><br/>Both the external (casing) and the internal (hinge/frame) screws were not tightened.  I noticed this 5 months later when the casing partially popped open and an internal (!) screw fell out.  I am quite fortunate that it didn't short anything out on its way.  I have a hard shell cover on the laptop which kept the external screws from getting lost.  I had to pull the whole thing apart to put the screws back, which meant removing all the outer screws including the ones hidden in the bumpers.  Half of the interior screws were not fully tightened, some were out half-way.  Generous application of Locktite Blue took care of this, but obviously I should not have to.<br/><br/>You can see the screw missing on the top-right in the photo, and the one that's still in is half-way out
fast, great screen
This is my 2nd Toshiba Chromebook, and by far the best due to the excellent HD screen & good sound.  The 13.3" screen size, is worth the extra size & slight weight, even for traveling.  The Skullcandy sound system directs the sound out of the top of the keyboard area  There is not much bass, but the sound quality is still very good.  I find the keyboard better than my earlier Chromebooks.<br/>With Google cloud print, you can print anything out of Google Drive.<br/>As Google continues to enhance the Chromebook, I can see myself using it more & more, mostly for surfing and entertainment.  I purchased a small Logitech wireless mouse, and have the Evecase Ultra-Portable carrying case with handle to hold the Chromebook, as well as the power cord and a flashdrive<br/>The new Toshibia Chromebook has the best combination of features, with the HD screen being the standout feature.  I'm very pleased with the value.
I use my Chromebook sparingly, but it's super fast, has a great display, and good battery life.  It's exactly what I needed.
Works as advertised.  Easy to use.  Beautiful screen resolution. If you are looking for a chromebook, this is a good choice.
I love the display on this Chromebook. I am a  part time photographer and love that my photos still look beautiful on this.
excellent, screen colour is accurate..just needs skype support. ive also noticed the battery starting to drain quicker now
So far so good.  Easy to start up.  Great screen picture.  Moves from one image to another quickly.  No complaints so far!
I have been very impressed with this product. I purchased the Chromebook to replace my five year old Lenovo laptop which was starting to exhibit some hardware issues. I primarily needed a machine that would be light, portable, and capable of web browsing (sometimes resource intensive, with ten or fifteen tabs open), using Google Apps (Google Drive and Docs, primarily), some light multimedia use, etc. After shopping around a bit, a friend recommended this model to me. It has been more than suitable for everything I need it to do! It is clearly an inexpensive build, but so far it has been sturdy enough, and I think the design is quite attractive. I still use my more powerful desktop for video and audio processing work, for image editing, and other more resource-intensive tasks, but this unit does everything I need to do when I am away from my home office.<br/><br/>UPDATE: After owning this item for less than three months, the Wifi radio went out and essentially rendered this machine useless for most of the applications I need it for. Toshiba requires the user to pay shipping for warranty service. I will be buying a different machine and reselling this one once it is repaired. A search of various support forums leads me to believe that this is a fairly common problem with this model, so be advised.
Having read most of the professional reviews, I'd say it is exactly what I expected it to be.  Not my first Chromebook.
Love this laptop! Don't use my macbook much anymore for normal day to day stuff. Quick, simple and no maintenance. The screen is sharp and clear- by far the best part. Hard to look at other screens after getting used to this one. Only tiny annoyance is that Wifi takes about 20 seconds to reconnect after opening lid. I usually start typing 5 seconds from opening it so my websites don't load and will give me a no internet error. Wait 15 seconds and they pop up perfectly. That's super minor and only an issue because it's instantaneous on. The power plug could be better too. It bends down towards the ground which is annoying and will lead to premature wear I fear since it gets torqued (should be straight like a macbook mag connector, Toshiba!!).<br/><br/>Buy with confidence. Sharp screen, good keyboard, great operating system, looks greats. No brainer!
Cheap, simple interface, modest looks, and a full HD IPS panel to boot. It's the perfect casual-use browser and note-taker, and I surprisingly don't mind the lack of local storage space like I thought I might. Thanks to Google Music, for I stance, I can stream my entire desktop music collection for free with no waiting time, anywhere I go.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my one half-complaint. The sound is quite light in the bass department, even for a portable computer. Of course, that can be circumvented with a portable amp and some headphones. After all, no one buys a laptop to have an amazing sound system anyway.<br/><br/>For those whose only computer is their portable, there are probably far better options out there than this. If all you need is a bit of no-hassle convenience on the go, like I do, this thing does the job and a whole lot more.
Just wish toshiba would make one with more than 16GB of hard drive space.... even 32GB would me more reasonable...
Surprisingly, this was a great item for the price. It's not an Apple... it's slower, and the internet access connectivity seems slower (then again, it's not 1500 dollars), and there are some minor issues, but for the price, it's excellent. Great screen, great for Netflix, etc... Lots of free programs/apps to download. Don't expect to do anything on the level of Apple or a Microsoft computer, but it will do all the things that Google has set up online.<br/><br/>And I have yet to get a virus. If I did, I can do a "powerwash" which deletes everything on the computer. Everything is backed up online, so when I come back, it's all there without a virus. I have done a powerwash before just to clean out the cobwebs, and it is no hassle at all. Just press one button, turn on the system again, and you are good to go!
BIGGEST PRO:  The IPS screen is fantastic: gorgeous colors, unlimited viewing angles, very bright.  Hands down the best screen on any Chromebook.  One drawback is that the high resolution exposes Chrome OS' lack of scaling.  Even though you can increase font size on websites (or zoom in), the UI elements remain tiny.  Lowering the resolution results in soft/blurry text.  I would love to see this screen with 720p native resolution - that would be perfect.  Or just a better way to scale UI elements.  As is, it will take some getting used to.  But that's a software issue - the hardware piece is amazing, truly.  Videos and pictures look crisp and gorgeous on it.<br/><br/>BIGGEST CON:  The performance of this Chromebook is just awful.  The combination of the weaker CPU together with 1080p resolution creates a sluggish experience.  And this is not just for "rich" websites or high-processing tasks.  In a lot of every day use, websites are  laggy, the scrolling is jumpy, and the experience is generally not smooth.  Even GMail (which you would think would be most optimized) is laggy - just scrolling through the inbox is choppy!!  For comparison, the Acer C720p (latest Haswell Celeron) and the Acer C720 (Haswell iCore 3) fly through these tasks, never any lag.  I had the 3 devices side by side trying different tasks/websites, and it's a world of difference.<br/><br/>I am disappointed.  Aside from the low performance, it's a great Chromebook.  Good build quality, small size, thin bezels, A+ screen, great battery life.  But the performance just does not deliver.  I bought a Chromebook for the web experience: quick and smooth.  That's the whole point of avoiding Windows.  Unfortunately this is not the case here.  I would gladly pay $500 for this device if it had a Haswell i3 CPU that would make the experience as smooth as on the Acer 720 series laptops.  Or a scaled down version with a 720p IPS screen to help smooth out the performance.  To me, this device is a flop: I'll be returning it, which makes me very sad because the screen is amazing.  But I can't handle choppy scrolling and laggy experience on this gorgeous screen.
Google Chrome is ok, Just dont purchase anything from google play . I have been purchasing movies and season shows since 2014, then all of a sudden a error message prevented me from viewing items. Google was not able to correct the problem, as it was something wrong with the google chrome. They were not willing to refund me all my Purchase but my last one - when clearly I can't view any shows.<br/><br/>Hi Shayla,<br/><br/>I understand that this problem can be pretty frustrating. Was there a particular title you were seeking a refund for? You have a lot of movie purchases, mostly dating back to 2014. The only purchase you have that was purchased recently enough to be refunded is season 2 of Power. Would you like a refund for that title or do you want to continue doing troubleshooting?<br/><br/>Andrew
It's fine.<br/>I like how our Google account is synced and has most of our Google related stuff in it.<br/>Just that the whole view of the menu's, the windows and the fonts are really small, I can't see them without having to lean in and squint my eyes a bit...<br/>I'm sure there's an option to change that somewhere in the settings, I'll figure it out eventually since I just got it a week ago.<br/>Also just a personal preference, but it doesn't have an Ethernet port or a cd/dvd drive since its flat and compact.<br/>Since I usually use those on occasion and not too often, it doesn't change my mind about getting this for my lady since she'll need it for some school work.<br/>I'll just need to buy a Ethernet cable and external CD/DVD drive.<br/>other than that, it's fine for its price range I guess.
This computer lasted me five months and then completely died. I am going through Toshiba to try and replace it.
Very good overall performance and battery life. I'm not a power user but this chromebbok is an excellent tool.
why am I giving it a one star?  Because the Toshiba warranty is a joke.  When I bought the computer 5 months ago the HDMI jack was slightly crooked, but it worked.  Now it is jacked up, won't accept an HDMI cable, so I called Toshiba service for repairs.  After spending 45 minutes on the phone, shuttled between 3 different service representatives, I was informed the service warranty will not be honored because I should have sent the computer back to Amazon as soon as I noticed the HDMI jack was a bit crooked, even if it worked.  And then they quoted me a repair price of $250, and then told me if I had bought the extended 'no fault' warranty they would have repaired it.<br/>Last Toshiba product I will ever buy.
love it, recommend it highly, especially if you want to manipulate photos and need a more powerful chromebook
Best Possible investment ever made. Chrome book is a great experience on: speed, performance and simplicity.
Currently using this Chromebook to write this review. Great laptop replacement, but if you are not use to the google user hemisphere it can be a bit of an adjustment.  I consistently get about 8-9 hours of battery life from browsing.  No freezing issues. The HD screen really sets it apart from other Chromebooks.  Speakers are adequate but I don't view movies on this machine often.<br/><br/>The only thing to complain about the chromebook is the trackpad.  As you "Tap" or "click" it makes an loose noise which is apparently normal according to other users.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a general laptop to do some browsing, "netflix and chill", and argue with some random people on the internet about angry cats, this is the perfect laptop for you.
I bought this Chromebook for my younger sister and she has not had a single issue with it so far.  Everything about it is perfect, the 4GB of RAM, the SSD drive, the 1080p screen, the long battery life.  I occasionally borrow it when I need to do something on the Internet, it's faster and more convenient than getting my powerful laptop.  It's always on, so I just open the screen, do what I need and then close the screen.  It's the perfect Internet device.  It doesn't have any of the annoyances of a smart phone or tablet, the screen is big and you get a real keyboard to type on.  It has all the benefits of a smartphone or tablet though, it's very portable, the battery lasts all day, and it's always on.  I most likely going to purchase another one just for myself.
Just what I needed!  I wanted a laptop that I didn't have to worry about updates or deal with viruses.
The perfect laptop for general web use. An excellent product all around at a really affordable price.
Great little laptop for my grandmother for the money... Does everything she needs, good build quality
This Chromebook is my go-to unless I need to work on something big. I have found that I can stream most apps that I need even MS office, (Office online) and Gimp so unless I need to actually work with an installed program, I reach for this quick little thing first. I carry it wherever I go, and actually do work on it as well. When I see the MAC users searching for power I just smile knowing that I have about 9 hours on this before I need to plug in. I am using Google Drive more often and use it on my Windows laptop as well so I have access to everything from both devices. I can get Box, Dropbox.com and I think there are plenty of others as well. Get one! The sound is awesome, the screen rocks, and it is light. I love it.
Fantastic little device. Its fast, light and the screen looks great. Keyboard is also a good size and comfortable. The battery is pretty good but I would have liked just a little bit more juice out of it. Perhaps another 45 minutes or an hour. It still will get ~7 hours or so, so I really can't complain too much about that. I also would have liked either at least 32 GB of internal space or at least have the option of upgrading the internal storage but that is not possible as it is soldered on. Was expecting it to be using an mSATA ssd like other Chromebooks out there. If 1 of these 2 things were to be different then I would have rated this device 5 stars. Its still the best Chromebook out there as of Dec 2014.
Best Chromebook so far.  I had the HP Chromebook 14 briefly but it gave me so much problems with keyboard characters not functioning.  I had to powerwash it all the time and that doesn't seem to work all the time either.  I returned it.  Now I have this wonderful, very clear vibrant screen and highly functioning chromebook from Toshiba.  It is light, has a long lasting battery and most importantly reliable and very functional.  For $279 this is a great value IMHO.  The speaker is very good as well and better than any laptop(windows included) I've ever had.  This is an awesome chromebook laptop!  Amazon Prime delivered it fast as usual.  I'm happy with this purchase and I highly recommend this unit.
This chromebook is perfect for anyone who just uses laptop for internet, movie streaming and email. I use all google doc,spreadsheets and it works<br/>great, cloud storage connects to phone and tablet perfectly. If you have to use it for work or school and are required to have a lot of different programs like Word and such, I wouldn't recommend it. But for daily personal use it works great. Especially for the price. Battery lasts up to a few days with normal use, always opens and loads in seconds and I have had it over a year with no problems. Very easy to use and reliable. Only downside is that you can't skype or use plug in printers. But works well with cloud printers, very easy set up.
This Chromebook 2, Toshiba's second inexpensive Chrome OS laptop, is a solid system with a full HD display, Skullcandy speakers, and 4GB of memory, but it doesn't stand out in this increasingly competitive category and when compared to something like this Chromebook here: http://amzn.to/1TzkQB9 will make you understand why its worth looking around.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>+ Large 13-inch display with full HD resolution.<br/>+ Skullcandy speakers.<br/>+ Smaller than previous model.<br/>+ Comes with 100GB cloud storage and two months unlimited Google Music.<br/>+ Double the usual RAM for smoother browsing.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- Minor color shifting when viewing display off-center.
This computer is a piece of junk. Six months after I bought it the screen has a 2" line down the middle and a 1" line on the bottom. I contacted the Amazon seller " Electronic Express' and they can't do anything because its over one month. I contact Toshiba and they say the repair is not covered under their standard warranty. I out $300 and have to buy a new computer after only six months. I don't think I will ever order from Amazon or buy another Toshiba product.
Honestly, this is one of the better Chromebooks out there, I love the HD screen, as it is very sharp and has nice detail display. I also love the spacious keyboard as I can type quite a bit using this device with no issues at all. Recent updates have made the Toshiba Chromebook 2 much faster than it was on launch and this is one of the benefits of Chrome OS devices. These devices still improve with almost every update, and that is really exciting to me. As of now there are several offline apps that you can use to manipulate your media and then sync those changes to the cloud when you get back your internet connection (I am never far from my phone or Wi-Fi so I don't use this much.)
Fantastic chromebook. Love the screen, the battery life, and the keyboard! Worth every penny.
Love it. This is it if everything we need is just facebooking, chatting, and watching videos.
After my wife spent almost two years of frustration using Windows 8/8.1 on a Dell laptop, we decided to pass that machine on to our college son (hoping against hope that the upcoming Windows 10 upgrade will be a lot better than 8/8.1 -- it certainly can't be any worse) and to get this Chromebook for her.  So far, she is thrilled with this.  A lot of what she does online is in the Google ecosystem anyway (Gmail, Google Docs, Chrome Browser, etc.), and this nice little machine does everything she needs.  In terms of feel and look, it compares very nicely to the MacBook we got a year ago for our college daughter.  In terms of cost, this Chromebook is much easier on the wallet!
I've had this chromebook for about a month now.  While it is not a speed demon, it ticks all the boxes asked of it for a VERY reasonable price.  There were some teething pains to have the relevant apps and extensions installed for PDF, Video, and Audio use.  As lawyer I hope for google docs and the other google 'office' products to continue to improve to become a suitable MS Word replacement.<br/><br/>It however has become and continues to be my daily go to machine ahead of my office desktop and my windows laptop.  It boots almost instantly, picks up immediately where I left off from previous use and plays very well with all the other google applications and products.
i previously purchased the asus chromebook 13.3 and was not happy the keyboard,the whole hardware felt cheap.the m key was comong off so i returned it after 5 days.got my new toshiba chromebook 6/30.LOVE IT! the ips display is such a big difference,the feel of this computer is quality.i almost forget its a chromebook.the key board is great,it responds to the touch.it just feels right.what would make the this chromebook out of this world if the hardware was made of aluminum,like my daughters samsung chromebook.overall i am happy with this purchase,and i will recomend this to any looking for an alternative to a laptop to surf,shop,emails,this is the perfect tool,peroid.
I Love it. It has a super brite screen and the battery life is amazing I would buy it again.
Husband loved this...fast for searching  the Internet. .lightweight. 4 gb of ram runs fast<br/>.
Great specs for the price. Zero maintenance. The only drawback is weak support for printers.
Absolutely a great Chromebook!  The full HD 1920 IPS screen makes all the difference, plenty of room to open multiple windows when compared to the standard 1366 HD screens on most Chromebooks.  Looking forward to Toshiba putting a Broadwell chip next year into their future version, the Bay Trail chip in this one is just ever so slightly slower than I'd like.  Certainly not a problem though in normal day to day use.  Have hardly been able to turn this thing off... keyboard, track pad and build quality are excellent.
I needed a new laptop but was on a budget. I tried numerous low-priced PCs but disliked them all. I skeptical purchasing a Chromebook for the longest time but decided to give it a try...and I haven't looked back!<br/><br/>Thinking about it now, having a Chromebook to serve my portable computer needs makes sense. I don't need a premium laptop because I have souped-up Mac Pro to do any heavy lifting in OS X or Windows and I already lived "in the cloud" well before I owned the Chromebook. However, that's not to say that this Chromebook isn't powerful in its own right or as limited in functionality offline as many people, myself initially included, think.
I bought this for my wife. It's a great product works really great with the wireless mouse.
I bought this for the price and ease of use and maintenance.  I really only surf the net and watch streaming video and with the 1080 full HD display its perfect for that.  I also really enjoy using the google cloud more often than I did on my PC.  Its great how I can make lists and spreadsheets and then access them on my phone using the cloud.  I wasnt totally sure what the chromebook was all about when I first bought it, but now I really like it.  It starts up and shuts down in what seems like an instant, it doesnt get bogged down with stupid fussy programs, the battery lasts a long time, and with google cloud services I can do everything I need with it.
A chromebook is exactly what it says it is: a chrome browser terminal.  I've had a lot of challenges using this thing with apps that said they were compatible with chromebooks but weren't really.  I'm even having significant trouble with offline google drive.<br/><br/>You have been warned: tech support's answer for everything is to return your computer to factory settings, and you will run into problems now and then, there is no point in having much hard drive space because you will wipe it from time to time.  The nice thing is that all your settings go with you and "powerwash" takes about as long as an older PC does just to turn on.
Good product
I have only had the Chromebook for 24 hours and LOVE it. I am coming from the CR-48 and a Windows laptop. CR-48 was perfect for getting it from Google, but I liked the updated Chromebook options now. The screen is the best I have seen. The font and icons are smaller then normal but I looked into this and found it is part of Chrome and not Toshiba. (maybe an update would fix?) I have charged it twice and the battery has been great. Speakers are the best I have heard in a Chromebook for sure. No fan to hear of and will be great for being silent and keeping cool. I would say get this Chromebook for the price and you'll be happy I'm sure.
By far the best computer I have ever owned.  Windows 8 is terrible and most windows laptops are ugly, slow/laggy, poorly designed, and full of bloatware.  Also, the touchpad that used to be in the center of most windows laptops a few years ago has randomly been shifted to the left or right on virtually all new windows laptops without explanation.  The Toshiba Chromebook 2 looks like a macbook and runs just as smooth but costs 1/4 of the price. Unlike most operating systems, Chrome OS actually gets better over time.  I give it a 98/100 and would give it a perfect score if it had a version that ran on an intel broadwell processor.
For my undergraduate studies I used a Lenovo laptop, but after 5 years and two replaced batteries the hardware issues finally called for a replacement. I opted to purchase a Chromebook since my at-home needs for a PC are almost entirely video streaming and internet browsing with occasional word processing. While the laptop stylistically looks nice, runs quite, and has a beautiful screen, it also runs surprisingly slow for a brand new machine. Prior to its death my 5+ year old Lenovo (also with 4 GB of RAM) operated faster than this machine.<br/><br/>Overall its a nice looking computer but I suppose you get what you pay for.
I love this little Chromebook it is a great idea and this one works really well I have no problems with the hardware itself except its a 720p display instead of 1080p. The chromebook software is great I like it a lot, I do wish it would support cds and dvds(even tho it is a dying median) also I wish it could support another browser, (I know its a CHROMEbook but I had to use a online program for school which chrome doesn't support but luckily I have a alienware 17 as well for that). This device is a good day day laptop that you bring with you to places because its light, tough, fast, and the battery last a really long time.
Really Great ChromeBook. Hands down the best one available under or at $300. The screen is better than even the more expensive Acer's that have a "FHD" display. This IPS panel is a real difference. Performance wise, definitely not a monster as with youtube running an HD vid in the background while browsing I have heard some jitters almost as in buffering to keep up. Still this is noticed on all Chromebooks I have used so far even others that are much higher spec that this one. Never thought I would buy a Toshiba but hands down the Screen sold me on this one. The only better screen available is on the Pixel IMO.
Really enjoying this system for what i bought it for, Basically email, social media, streaming Netflix to my TV.  I am NOT using it for any real business applications.  It seems lightning fast, simple and easy to use for what I am doing with it.  I did notice that on some TV shows that had a lot of dark clothing and backgrounds that the Black looked a little weird.  A backlit keyboard would be nice, but I knew it didn't have one going into the purchase so I can't ding it for not having one.  I would absolutely recommend, in fact I already have recommended it to some friends, and bought a second unit for my girlfriend.
My chromebook 2 is still under warranty; but tech support will not diagnose my problem because I can't provide the serial number which has rubbed off the back cover. I forgot to register the unit with Toshiba when I bought it at Best Buy 11 months ago. Best Buy did not include the serial number on the receipt which I still have and I didn't keep the box. Best Buy does not have the serial number. The unit will not turn on. I tried another power cable and it still will not turn on. I've bought Toshiba electronics for many years; but no more.
just received yesterday... still playing around so i'll update as needed but right out the gate this Chromebook is great. its not heavy, but it feels solid unlike a lot of other chromebooks which just feel light, cheap, and plastic-y. the screen resolution is absolutely beautiful; i cant choose between all the different default wallpapers. they all so such artistic and beautiful photos that really do a great justice to the screen.<br/>this is my first Chromebook so i'm still getting use to the ChromeOS. it is different but has been capable of doing everything i would do normally so far. i'm definitely satisfied.
One of the best chromebooks on the market. Beautiful screen, excellent battery life.
Great screen quality.  Computer is light and thin. Works fast.  Buying a second one.
I absolutely love it, I think this may be one of my best technology purchases ever.
works great, a little tricky with movies but its quick, small....gets a little hot
Just love this Chromebook. I have seven computers, Macs, Pcs all running Linux or Mac OS. Just one laptop running windows (for certain software packages). But for just browsing and ease of use the Chromebook is a pleasure to use. Light and fast. Not always brilliant at picking up WIFI signals compared to my Smartphone but I can live with that. (I just move to a different position then move back). Superb colours and resolution. I would recommend this machine if just browsing is your cup of tea (or coffee).
This is my second Chromebook. I really like the screen size and the resolution. The speakers are really amazing and make watching videos so much more enjoyable than my Acer. The only reason I did not give it five stars is that it has difficulty connecting to some wireless routers. I don't know why, but all of my other devices will be connected and this one won't. It is not a deal breaker for me since the locations of those routers are outside of my home and not places that I really need the Chromebook.
Just what I expected...great display, fast processing. Perfect computer for me
Excellent, does exactly what I need and is perfect for Uni.<br/><br/>Buy it!
It does the trick for my needs.  I have an Epson printer that does not work with my Chromebook Toshiba.  Very disappointing.  So check out these features before you buy it.  It didn't come with any papers any navigating tools, tutorials, nothing.  Just the computer in a box.  Fortunately you have a live person to talk to if you need help.  There was quite a long waiting time to get him on the screen, but eventually he showed up.  But there are lots of features that I would like to know and understand.  Not to many people have this computer so it's hard to get help.
We purchased this Cromebook 2 in November 2014, The screen went bad and was unreadable in July 2015. Product still under 1 year warranty.<br/>Called Toshiba and they do not warranty the screen. They give no reason, just "so sorry". Toshiba does not stand behind the products and I will never purchase any Toshiba product again based on their non-warranty.<br/><br/>Avoid this product, and Toshiba if you want a quality product.
LOVE my new Toshiba Chromebook. Starts up fast, shuts down fast. Thought maybe moving from a Windows machine to a Chromebook might take some getting used to, but its no problem. My Windows PC was getting REAL slow at starting up and shutting down. Took a bit to figure out setting up printing, but once set up, works like a charm. Display is nice and bright. Very easy to see. Keyboard takes a little getting used to, but its not bad either Would (and have already) recommended this Chromebook to friends.  No remorse about this purchase - great device, great price :)
This is best Chromebook so far. It has a very nice HD screen. I run my brightness halfway and its still a great picture. Speakers on this are great for laptop speakers. Best speakers I have heard on a chromebook or most windows laptiops. If you pay 800 or more on a laptop it should be better than this. If your looking for a quick easy way to surf without windows this is it. I look at this as a compliment machine. I will say any slowness I found was from a shorty WiFi signal or poor download speeds. Don't be surprised if more OS company's go to this model.
A Chromebook with an amazing screen. When you buy a CB at this stage, there are certain areas you'll have to accept inherent shortcomings (i.e. memory, processor, build). With this second Chromebook from Toshiba, you are getting an excellent screen, an acceptable processor, and reasonable amenities for the price. The only area I had a slight qualm was on the top of the screen right at the bezel is some minor buckeling eight near the webcam. This hasn't destroyed my experience, I get the same brilliant battery life, screen, speed of connection, etc.
I was sick of viruses and update issues.  I've had to have PCs "wiped"  3 times, at $100 each time.  My son helped me pick out this Chromebook.  It was top rated in Wired Magazine.  (I think that's the name of the magazine.)<br/>I'm still in the 20th Century when it comes to tech stuff but I was able to set this Chromebook up all by myself.  The keyboard is a little different but nothing I can't adapt to.<br/>The HD screen allows me to watch movies on Amazon Prime.<br/><br/>This is one of the best purchases I've ever made from Amazon!
since my non-hd version of toshiba chromebook 2 started to have a problem, and wanted to have a better resolution, i purchased it. have been used a couple of days.(will be add more later)<br/>well, this one is almost identical of the previous version except the screen resolution and design.<br/>pros: high resolution and moderate price. keyboard. touchpad.<br/>cons: less battery life & slower performance than the previous version.  // design is bit wacky.<br/><br/>haven't tested camera or other features yet because no need them much.
I don't think I ever did a review on anything around here, lol. But I think this little machine deserves at least one, we love it, cheap, screen is gorgeus, you open it and is always ready for you, I would say is very very fast with chrome (and that is not usual, lol, chrome has gotten so big and stuffed that is not light anymore), for someone who needs to be online, no local specific running programs, eventual document/sheets editing, printing and all is just perfect, light, last longs and charges fast. We are very very happy with it.
I absolutely love my Chromebook! It loads everything lightning fast, and I can watch streaming videos and movies with no problem and no lag in time. The HD quality is amazing. I didn't give it a five star rating solely because the keyboard is not easy to use. I need the keys to stand a little higher so that I can more easily feel the separation between the keys. I use my slow desktop computer for anything that doesn't need access to the internet, which means I turn it on maybe once a week. But I use my Chromebook all day every day!
Just live it, fast, easy to use, I use it most everyday, great product.
Summary:<br/><br/>Benefits:<br/>IPS 13.3" 1920 x 1080 screen<br/>Long battery life<br/>Full size keyboard<br/>Chrome OS<br/>Fast bootup and shutdown<br/>Good sound for a little laptop<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Processor can't handle full 1080P HD - skips pops frequently on all 1080p video (720p plays fine)<br/>Light bleed on IPS panel<br/>Trackpad "button" could be better feeling - takes a lot of force to push down<br/><br/>Description:<br/>This Toshiba chromebook 2's is on the pricey end of low end chromebooks, no question about it.  It is in fact priced higher than many very low end Windows 8 laptops with faster processors.  It's real draw of course is the IPS 1080p panel.  The screen pops to life.  Viewing angles are excellent.  Really hard to say why other chromebooks (or other laptop manufacturers) aren't using IPS screens for a little extra cost - I'm sure it would help improve sales significantly.  Take it from someone who's seen many LCD panels and tablets, it is one of the best laptop panels out on the market, probably short of say the macbook pro retina display (this hands down beats the macbook air TN display).<br/><br/>Then why not 5 stars?  The processor.  Faster than many of the Exynos based ARM achitecture chromebooks out there yes.  Does it perform like a modern processor even on low end pentium based Windows laptop - no.  Web pages will come in stuttering, scrolling stutters frequently.  Most importantly for me, when you place a 1080p screen on the computer, it would be nice to be able to play 1080p videos without stuttering, which this laptop is unable to do.  Youtube, flash, and other h.264 based videos on the net will stutter, skip, bleep, as frames and audio is skipped.  It has nothing to do with buffering issues as I've already buffered large segments of the video, but the playback is where it stutters.  I've tried shutting down all the extra tabs to no avail.  Toshiba really should have looked beyond this current underpowered processor for something a little more powerful and up to date - the haswell line of mobile processors is likely to outperform this underpowered processor for minimal cost, and really make this machine sing.  Again if it wasn't for the processor issue, this chromebook would be a 5/5.  But it is frustrating to watch a video and have it skip and jump as the processor can't keep up.
This is a great little machine. Much much faster than a pc at a similar price point. The battery life is not what is advertised but I get just under 6 hours which is not to bad at all. Basically this is just really fast. It's fast to start up, fast to load Web pages and plays all movies from all sites in HD without any issues. Even over a crappie connection it is really fast. Also the screen is great and the shortcut keys and track pad functionality is great. It's at least a good of a computer as what  90 percent of need.
This is everything I had hope it would be.  It's well worth the money.
this is by far the best chromebook ive ever had the pleasure of buying
After reading all the reviews I choose this Chromebook. The display is truly awesome! I was a little concerned about the reviews that indicated it might be slow with too many tabs open. I have not found this to be the case ... in fact, with 3 or less tabs open it is very fast. ( I compared it to my Dell PC w/ Windows 10 & an I5 processor) I should point out that I have a 50 MB internet connection, however that would not change the speed of the PC. Very happy with my purchase ... time will tell if it holds up well.
This immediately became my go-to piece of technology for work. I move around a lot, and spend most of my time working remotely from wherever I happen to be at that moment.<br/><br/>This chromebook is even more useful than I thought it would be. I anticipated having to connect remotely to my windows machine at home on occasion, but have not yet had to do so.<br/><br/>The available apps and extensions run smoothly, and the screen is every bit as gorgeous as advertised.<br/><br/>For the price, it's a steal.
This piece of equipment is absolutely fantastic. This weekend I casted the History Channel  Series Viking to the by flat screen and Oh Happy Sunday!!.<br/>Its speedy and always on. Perfect for my facebook posts and my genelogy work. I use google drive and docs heavily and this lets me access all those things. The images on the screen do need adjusting has sometimes things are a bit small but this is a great item if you primarily work on the internet or need access to it. Now I just need some accessories.
I was a bit nervous to make the jump to a Chromebook but so far this is great! I had an Acer Chromebook for about 24 hours but the 11.6 screen is way too small. After doing some more research I came to the many reviews (not just on Amazon) about the Toshiba. This is an awesome computer and with Office 365 Online I really don't feel like I'm missing much at all!<br/><br/>It's super fast and will load in only a few seconds!
A good chromebook. The screen is pretty good (but I still wish it were matte). The keyboard is acceptable by general standards and pretty good compared to my previous chromebook. The system does not fly, but is also not slow at all, which is pretty damn good for the price you pay. The trackpad is actually really good. It is the first time that I do not disable the "tap to click" function in a trackpad because it actually wish as I want it to work. The battery lasts a really long time too.
Great battery life and very nice screen. I'm glad I chose this one.
Got this for my 80+ year old mother.  Her ancient Xp machine became too slow (and unsafe).  I will be delivering it this weekend.  We will see if she likes it as much as I do.  I am tempted to get one for myself.  I love the screen, which is one of the main reasons for getting this model.  It runs fast enough for me, even with a dozen tabs open.  I am still getting used to the Chromebook ecosystem.  Hopefully, for just email and casual web browsing, it will be more than adequate for my mother.
It is everything you could want in a chrome book. I love how fast it gets you to the internet. I am very pleased with my experience with it so far. I have had no trouble finding solutions to anything I needed to know about. I am a self-taught computer geek and it is easy to learn how to use out of the box. The cloud storage is a great feature for anyone who does a lot of note taking or photos.In my opinion you get a lot of computer for a reasonable price. The HD screen is fantastic as well.
Love my new chromebook! Simple to use and searches on the internet is pretty fast. It took a little time for get use to the keyboard but I am still trying to improve this.  This is really a good price for this product and would buy again as a gift.  No real complaints, pictures and sound are very good.  Delivery was quite a bit faster than I expected.  I thought the screen size would be too small --but it is all I really need.  I am very pleased with this purchase and give it a thumbs up!!
This is a terrific Chromebook -- fast, reliable, lightweight and well-made.  The screen resolution is fantastic.  I bought this for my wife six months ago and recently purchased a second one for our family's use.  We also purchased a Google Cloud-ready HP printer and found that it works best when using Google apps rather than Microsoft cloud apps (no surprise).  Similar to another reviewer, about the only thing I honestly need a Windows/Mac for at this point is Quicken software.
Chromebooks are wonderful devices.  This really is the modern web experience.<br/><br/>I'd suggest getting at least the HD IPS display this Chromebook has, and at least 4 GB of RAM.  I installed the System Info app, and I regularly see RAM usage of around 2 GB so some of the cheaper models with less RAM may not perform as well as this one.<br/><br/>I gave the Toshiba to the kids (but I'm borrowing it right now...), and I purchased an Acer 15.6" screen model for my use.
Lightweight.  Beautiful, bright, and crystal clear screen.  Multiple tabs open and function beautifully.  Long lasting charge.  Strong wifi signal.  Excellent remote controller for my home PC via chrome share.  Works well as ssh client.  Even watched the Super Bowl 2015 on it!!<br/>Only gripe - No Native VMWare Horizon Viewer to remote into work. I realize HTML 5 remote access is available from VMware for RA- but it's not one of my options.<br/>Ummmm Just do it - Get one!
Once you get used to a strictly Google platform you'll love it.
Loved this CB until the display crapped out. After that I was ready to throw it out even under warranty because Toshiba's customer service was terrible. No live chat no email support only phone support which takes forever and you can't understand them.  After that they made me PAY to ship them their defective device for repair that can take up to 2 weeks......  Toshiba lost me as a customer
I broke my MacBook Pro a few weeks ago, and I needed a cheaper alternative to buying a new one. Being a college student, I needed a computer that would meet my academic needs, play music, and allow me to post on social media. This chrome book was exactly what I was looking for. I reviewed hundreds of different laptops and finally decided on this one. The screen is big and the keys aren't too light. The music quality is impressive and the battery life meets my needs.
the first one I received was a lemon - the screen did not work, but the next day I received a replacement and I love it.  It is super fast compared to my 5 year old Macbook and it does everything I need.  The only trouble I am having is getting my printer to set up with cloud print.  Other than that, it is awesome.  I like being able to open it up and start working where as I was sitting and waiting for the computer to boot up and then for programs to load, etc.
For my wife, no questions just works! It is a beautiful device
Bought for my daughter.  It's a keeper.  Does all it needs to.
Lightweight, fast, powerful, just like a superhero.
Have had it for a month. Does everything it's supposed to do.
Sleek, stylish and light. Excellent for college. I like it.
I researched and read a million reviews before I purchased the Toshiba CB35-B3340 and I am so happy that I went ahead and did purchase this computer. It does the job for me and the 1080 resolution is awesome. I also love the 13.3 inch screen size and the weight is great, not too heavy and not at all bulky or clumsy feeling. So all in all I am very satisfied.
I thought this might be a bad buy but turns out I made a great choice.  I had read reviews that the chromebook was slow and whatnot which is a little true.  Sometimes it needs a second but overall it is great for browsing the internet and all.  I even tried the Linux chroot route which works fantastic as well.  My next project is to get it set up with my other computer to share the cursor and keyboard but one thing at a time.
I have had this computer for 2 days. Overall it is a good computer. Screen is fantastic. Nice keyboard. Speed is good but not great. I have stutter sometime on 1080p videos. The SD reader will not read any of my SD cards. I have stuck 4 different SD cards and the computer does not even know they are in there. Also it will not recognize my TV. I have plugged it up via HDMI to 3 tv's while 1 tv worked and the other 2 didn't.
Fabulous buy. I purchased one for myself last year and loved it so much I bought my mother one a few weeks ago. It's 13 inch and has a very bright and beautiful image display. Highly compact and light weight. Runs on battery back up for 6 hours!<br/><br/>Only drawback is the sound system is skull candy. Not the best and a bit "tinny". This is easily rectified by purchasing a high quality pair of headphones.
Gift for our college - bound daughter.  Nearly as handy as a Macbook Air at 1/4th the cost, she wanted the Air but we just couldn't afford it.  But she loves this (with the exception of not being able to run ITunes).  It is Very light and thin, beautiful display, snappy response and cool looking.  She is able to do all that she needs easily and quickly.  Parents and daughter are more than pleased with this purchase.
Overall, it is a great product. I'm pretty much satisfied. Though I'm a little bit disappointed because it can't handle playing videos 1080p without the video being jittery. I mean, the screen supported full HD 1080p, but if it can't handle such huge video file, then what is the point.. And another thing is because it can't play the video with subtitle (srt file). Hope they can fix these things with their updates.
Bought this for my mom and in a lot of ways it's perfect for her. Has a beautiful HD, IPS screen for watching videos on Netflix and plenty of power for a glorified Facebook machine. I'd probably give it 5 stars, except that after 4 months the AC adapter died. Well, I *hope* that's the issue as it won't turn on. If it is more than that I'll be furious. No one expects tech to last forever, but 4 months is pathetic.
This laptop is everything I need and completes pretty much all of the normal tasks I use a laptop for. I am a university student and it's light weight and great screen make it easy to take notes and do work. Would recommend this laptop for people who are in constant WiFi areas but now days most people are anyway. Great laptop and was able to ship to australia which I liked as we don't have this model here.
This is an awesome product. Buy it and love it....!!!
Super notebook! Love Chromebook features, the screen is second generation and full 1080 video. Yes, you can't use with Microsoft office, but open source and google office products work just fine. A great, light notebook for trips and the battery lasts from 7 to 9 hours of use, even lots of YouTube stuff! I would certainly recommend for a general travel computer where MS Office is not needed.
Great chromebook. Lightening fast, crisp resolution.  We use computers for email, amazon prime, reading, searching - fairly simple applications.  This is great for what we needed and when my larger laptop starts to slowdown I will buy another chromebook.  This Toshiba had great ratings and a good size screen.  Will wait perhaps for a larger screen but for the money this is a great computer.
I bought it for myself and on quite a few occasions, I confused it with Macbook Air. It goes to show how capable this little guy is. Fast browsing, crisp and HD screen. With a price tag of only $279 when I bought it. (At one point after my purchase, it was at $250 for a few days from Worstbuy, oh well.) Now my wife is competing with me to use it. Maybe I will buy again when it goes on sale.
This thing is incredible.  None of the Windows BS.  No viruses.  Incredible at what it does.  If you want something with a great screen to surf the net, this is what you want.  This is not something for "work".  But if you have a work computer and just want something for the net stuff you'll love this.  It's not a Mac, but it cost me $50 more than the apple care plan for a macbook.
Screen looked great.  Fast enough for just about about everything.  Keyboard was nice for a comapct design and the touch-pad though a bit cheap feeling always worked as expected.<br/><br/>But unfortunately, after about 4 month it simply won't power on.  :(
I bought this for my son.. I have had very good experiences with my previous 2 Toshiba laptops and the currently using one with windows 7.. this chromebook looks and feels very upmarket considering the low cost.. Its surprisingly good looking and having good built quality ! my son loves it.. its super fast to boot !! though its still new, I will update my review if anything goes wrong...
Amazing Screen! Fast, Light and the Price is Right!
Got this for my wife (she of the account name), but she didn't like it because "it's not a laptop" (i.e. not running windows).  I pointed out that this is the whole point, but alas no good.  I however am finding it fantastic for browsing.  Screen is brilliant, form factor perfect for couch surfing, and I am running more and more Google docs now because of it.
Great screen. Efficient OS. Body is a bit cheap.
Beautiful screen, lightweight, and pretty good battery life...only negative i have after using it for 2 months would be a slight problem when playing hd video, there is a slight choppiness to the video from time to time, even when this occurs it is not that bad...i would definitely recommend this laptop for someone who is looking to stay under the $300 mark.
The screen images are crisp and it does everything I need at a bargain price.  It obviously not an Apple laptop but I don't need or want one of those.  You are limited with the cloud based system but if your needs do not exdeed your limits then it really doesn't matter.  This machine is plenty fast and very convenient.  Battery life seems more than adequate.
Had this for 2 weeks now, its under $300 at most places, ignore the 3rd party price gouging on Amazon<br/><br/>First the good points:<br/><br/>-Beautiful screen, IPS, 1080p, really gorgeous, all my friends and coworkers want to buy this laptop after I bought it<br/>-very light, less than 3 lbs, incredible how portable this sucker is<br/>-excellent build quality, I've used many laptops from many brands and the build quality on this is great. Feels very strong<br/>-EXCELLENT battery life, easily use it 8 hours a day, never have issues on an airplane or all day office work<br/>-nice speakers, played some jazz, pop , variety of music and very nice treble and good mids and clear highs<br/><br/>Bad points:<br/><br/>-1 star for the slow CPU,<br/>-1 star for Chrome OS, it couldnt open multiple websites or play 1080 video, would complain my cpu is too slow, also some audio process called cras would eat up 100% of CPU usage, horrible OS<br/><br/>The CPU chokes when multiple intensive websites are open. However, I can have MS OFFICE excel/word and VNC and windows remote desktop open without issues. It does slow down with heavy flash websites.<br/><br/>Chrome OS sucks, I couldn't even play videos 720p or 1080p. I had to install crouton with xfce ubuntu to do regular stuff like VNC into work, connect to Cisco VPN, rdesktop into windows machines, work on office documents, play 1080p movies with proper foreign (Chinese) subtitle support<br/><br/>Overall I highly recommend this laptop for everyone, just wish the CPU was faster. The 16 GB of HDD space is somewhat limiting, but the SDCARD slot is great for popping in a 32GB or 64GB SD card and having tons of space for media. IF this thing shipped with haswell and Ubuntu out of the box, it'd be a 5 star review no doubt.<br/><br/>Updated by 1 star since crouton is so easy to install to get full fledged Linux<br/><br/>Updated March 1, 2015<br/>-Ok, the latest ChromeOS update makes it better. Facebook games play OK and offline local movies can play with foreign subtitles without issue. This makes it a decent replacement for most users. I only use crouton now for doing work stuff like VPN into company network and run VNC and windows remote desktop.
Of course, any Chromebook is going to have trade-offs.  This Toshiba was worth paying a little extra for.  The screen is very nice, the speakers are good and the keyboard is decent.  The plastic case is no aluminum unibody (which will surprise nobody for this price class), but it looks fine and feels okay.  For what a Chromebook is, this Toshiba is good.
This is a great computer for the price. The screen quality is amazing, and the audio is way better than expected. The keyboard has a very macbook-like feel, with convenient volume and brightness buttons as well as other shortcuts. There is a charging indicator light that is very helpful, and the trackpad is huge and easy to use. Overall extremely happy!
Has the feel of a macbook and very easy to use. My macbook of 10 years finally had to be replaced but wasn't willing to spend that much money just yet for another one.If you really don't do anything but surf the web and do minor word processing, this computer is the one for you. Price is reasonable and so far I have been very impressed with this laptop.
got a very good deal for christmas .
Awesome product for streaming and web browsing
WOW! SUPER FAST. BEAUTIFUL SCREEN. EASY SETUP.
my new chromebook seams to be excellent. it is sometimes a little slow due to my wi-fi connection. no fault of the computer. picture is very good. the light weight makes it easy to carry and the battery time per charge is also excellent.  most of the problems i have will disappear as i learn more about what all it will do and how to do it.  Ron
Works great for my daughter. The screen is lovely. One thing though the font is tiny at 1080p so I made the font larger I bought this refurbished and it looked new my daughter doesn't need the 100gb online storage she's only 5 I just need her to get used to using a computer and there is parental lock extensions in the Google store that work.
Just received this item and love its quality.
This is exactly what I needed. It works perfectly for email,  Facebook, SurveyMonkey, ConstantContact, ShowClix ticket sales, Google searches, and other functions that require the internet. I do not need it for word processing, Excel, etc. I love the HD larger screen, and the type size can be adjusted to be larger. Very happy with it.
We bought this product on Aug 1, 2015. It stopped working on 12/2/2015 for no apparent reason. It was still under the one-year warranty so we called and gave them the Serial No.  They said it was registered on May 13, 2015 by someone else and that he had called on July 9, 2015 for a wifi issue. Clearly this chromebook was NOT NEW!
PROS:<br/>-Excellent Full HD display<br/>-Outstanding value for money<br/>-Good battery life<br/>-Simple, attractive design<br/>-High-quality keyboard and trackpad<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>-Fragile lid<br/><br/>If you can't afford this laptop for some reason, there's the second best for you to choose: http://bit.ly/1xP4Sw0
The screen on this is impressive but I received this with a missing key so I sent it back for a refund.  But the screen I cannot get over how great this was, one of the nicest screens I have seen on a chromebook.  It was bold and rich font.  Looked great but since I sent it back, the screen was all I got to see working well.
Such a great machine for the money. Absolutely no regrets buying this thing. That said, youtube struggles a bit in 1080p. My PC, etc seem to be able to handle this fine, so I don't think it's my network. I would just think YouTube should run amazingly on a Chromebook for like... moral reasons?<br/><br/>Still - great buy!
Great computer. Fits all my college needs.
We bought this for our 6th grader to use for homework in lieu of the family computer and it's been great.  We had a few issues figuring out how to use it but our son figured it out fairly quickly and he's been off and running.  He even figured out how to link wirelessly to our printer. This was a great investment.
Its a cheap and nice looking little lap top that accomplishes everything that I need it to. It has no caps lock but other than that the keyboard is as expected. Good for web browsing but doesn't do well with many many tabs open (like I tend to operate). You have to be a little more focused and a little less ADD :)
It's a Chromebook - with all of the Chromebook limitations.  But of all the Chromebooks, this is by far the best one I've ever used and was worth every penny.  Best Chromebook keyboard I've ever used and the trackpad is also excellent.  If you're in the market for a Chromebook, this is the one to buy, hands down.
I hit a stroke of bad luck and had the display go bad after around 5 days of use. Same issue that I've seen with many others here (top left of screen breaks without any physical damage to the device). The main issue I've had has been the horrendous Toshiba customer support. They've hung up on me multiple times, given promises that they haven't been able to keep, and have been horribly disorganized during the entire process.<br/><br/>I would advise against buying this chromebook/Toshiba products in general just because of how bad their customer support experience has been.
This is an excellent Chromebook. The only downside is the price.<br/><br/>The display is much better than most Chromebooks, and the full HD resolution is fantastic.<br/>Speed is good and design is streamlined. Intel CPU and 4 GB off RAM really make a difference.<br/>The track pad is large and works well.
This is the third chrome book that I have owned and the screen is awesome!  It's light and the build quality seems good but I would not call it rugged.  The lid does have a little bit of flex in it when opening / closing.  Battery life varies a lot based on the task but 6-7hrs seems to be the average.
Easy to use as a new chrome os user, albeit it does takes me awhile to do all the setup n get used with the shortcut.....<br/>Really impressed by the helpful amazon team.<br/>Google just changed its logo a week after I started using......dunno if they gotta change all the design of the chromebooks??
so i bought the toshiba chromebook 2 (TC2) to replace my hp chromebook 11. i wanted something a little bigger with better performance cause the hp 11, even though it was nice, it had poor battery life and laggy performance. ive had the TC2 since febuary so about 4 months now and its done everything i wanted except 1 thing which ill get to in a bit but 1st ill say the good stuff. 1. just like the other reviews, it has a very nice bright sharp display with some really nice accurate colors. 2. keyboard feels just right. 3. sound coming from the skullcandy speakers is nice though it does lack bass but still sounds good and are fairly loud. 4. even though its made out of plastic, build quality seems good. computer is thin and light and havent had a problem with it in the 4 months that ive had it. 5. battery life is good but not great. so far on average ive been getting about 7 hrs depending on what im doing but ive never gotten the 9hrs its supposed to get. but still a slight improvement from the hp 11. and now the bad part. 6. the performance. the TC2 got everything right except the performance. even though on paper it seems that it would be alot better than the hp 11 due to it having a faster intel processor not an ARM processor and double the RAM, it still only a bit faster than the hp 11. the TC2 loads most web pages fast but the real problem comes when streaming video. it works great when on netflix or youtube but on web pages with alot of web traffic or alot going on it will play the video but with non stop lag. for example, i cant play anything from project free tv or any videos from gamespot.com etc. overall 95% of the time it does what its supposed to do. so if you decide to purchase this chromebook just keep in mind that it wont play some online videos. hope this review helps!!!
I have a fast windows 8 desktop that I built myself. However, as a college student taking online classes I wanted something cheap that I could carry around at school or other parts of the house. That's where this Chromebook shines. I'll give a view examples of where I get my moneys worth for this Chromebook.<br/><br/>-Do online homework on the couch while watching a baseball game or something else on tv all the time<br/>-Last night I set the laptop up in the kitchen so I could read a recipe off of it while I did some baking.<br/>-I carry this to class in my backpack and notice no weight difference. I connect to the schools wifi and can do homework or take notes during class<br/>-Watch Netlfix in bed or browse the internet late into the night and it never feels uncomfortable with it's light weight. However streaming HD video can cause it to warm up a bit.<br/>-Go to coffee shops with my gf where we can work on homework together<br/>-Have pandora open and multiple tabs while I work on an essay using microsoft word online and have no lag<br/><br/>There are lots of benefits that this Chromebook has that a desktop does not. And since I already have something with a cd drive, lots of HDD space and that can run most applications. this fits my missing needs perfectly. SO why choose this over a more expensive windows 8 laptop or Macbook? Read the pro's.<br/>Pro's<br/>-The battery last at least 7 hours, only takes 1 hour to charge;<br/>-1080p 13.3 inch IPS screen with wide viewing angles (me and my girlfriend can watch Netflix on it together and neither suffer from limited viewing angles)<br/>-weighs almost nothing<br/>-starts up in seconds, web pages load almost instantly, no lag with multiple tabs<br/>-everything from google (drive, search, docs, hangouts, etc) works as you'd expect<br/>-fanless<br/>-you can use microsoft office online for free, google docs online or offline for free<br/>-ac wifi adapter with good range<br/>-sd card fits nicely into the slot, doesn't stick out so you can leave it in<br/>-usb 3.0 slot<br/>-physically it looks nice all around<br/>-keys are soft and feel good to press, reminds me of a macbook keyboard<br/>-updated all the time<br/><br/>Cons<br/>-runs warm on the bottom with heavy use<br/>-1080 UI scaling is very small, you can increase font and zoom, but tabs and icons remain small, however I got used to this quickly, you can also decrease the resolution from 1080p to around 800 with a quick keyboard combo (ctr shift + or -)<br/>-front webcam is low quality, grainy<br/>-speakers aren't all that impressive, just ok<br/><br/>If you want something that's light, portable has a beautiful screen, and can be used use all day for internet related tasks and you want something more efficient than a tablet, then get this Chromebook with the full HD screen. Considering the features and price, you won't be disappointed.
This is my second chromebook after the reference CR-48. So you can imagine that the performance improvements I'm observing are huge! Some of you are worried that the processor inside this thing is slower than the previous model and might not be able to keep up. But I will say that I'm very happy with whatever processor is inside this thing. It boots up in under 10 seconds every time, 2-finger gestures, panning/zooming, scrolling are buttery smooth. I stay mostly under 10 open tabs and I don't recall facing any slowness ever. The one time I did see my browser become unresponsive was when I was trying to arrange/edit a picture album containing 400+ photos. But then that particular photo album made the chrome browser hang even on my (AMD Phenom II X6) desktop! The biggest advantage of having a slower processor in this thing (as I understand) is that it allowed them to make this chromebook fanless, resulting into a more compact product. I greatly appreciate the fanless design because that makes this chromebook completely free of any moving parts and makes it more durable. Importing pictures from an SD card works fine, it was able to import close to 1000 pictures (at 2048px resolution) and upload them to my google+ photos in less than an hour. The full HD shiny screen is really nice, however I find text on most webpages to be too small at 100% zoom, so I have it set at 110% zoom by default. Watching netflix and youtube videos is a charm. I also find the sound to be more than sufficient. The battery takes about 2.5 hours to charge completely and lasts me around 8 hours. Google hangouts works as expected. No complaints on the hardware front, the screen, the hinge, the keyboard and touchpad all are very nice. The screen brightness is also more than sufficient as I have it set under 50% brightness most of the time. There are smaller touches like opening the lid wakes up the chromebook, inserting the headphone unmutes the chromebook etc that make this a joy to use. If you are making a jump from an earlier chromebook, I would recommend this. If you are making a jump from a tablet, I very strongly recommend this.
I am soooo happy not to deal with windows, that I could dance :). This is a wonderful replacement  for my laptop.  I couldn't  be happier. After learning a few keyboard tips and shortcuts, I've been able to make a fairly painless transition into the  chromebook world. I highly recommend this.
Works great. Very light. Sharp screen. I was nervous I couldn't use my PPT and word documents, but I found out you can open the PPT document and then change it into a google slide show and then edit it easily. The computer is not very expense so I'm not nervous lugging it around. Very happy.
beautiful screen love this chromebook!
Amazing in every way. The only issue is viewing photos/videos on an SD card that's inserted into the slot. It does not display the pictures in order and the video is super choppy and discolored. I've done several updates, but this is still an issue. If they can correct this it will be 100%!
The machine works very well. However, a few weeks into owning it, a line of pixels died, and I started having trouble getting an HDMI connection. Toshiba is fixing the chromebook under its one year warranty. Aside from those hardware issues, I love this computer more than my fancy laptop.
This machine delivers all the desires improvements needed on a second generation chromebook.<br/>There are excellent Youtube reviews that are accurate and well explained<br/>The screen is best of class and compares with the best notebook computers<br/>The processing speed is excellent for my business and personal computing tasks on a 12/2 Mbps Uverse wifi<br/>Some experts have questioned the processor speed but I cant see it- however I am not a gamer.<br/>I was able to replicate all but one of my MS office apps via Google apps and extensions and fully sync to Outlook via Companionlink($).  Only exception - I  have not found full equivalent to Visio Pro<br/>Google Chrome tech support is excellent with email response within a few hours and phone support within a few minutes.<br/>It a good thing because Toshiba tech support appears to be nonexistent for Chromebooks. When you call you must be routed to the special Chromebook support desk that appears not to be staffed - 90 minute wait until I gave up.<br/>The Chrome environment exceeds my expectations and will speed my move from MS PC to the Cloud environment<br/>I dont normally buy an extended warranty on electronics but I did for this as I think it is wise to consider for all new products<br/>I will revise this review if I ever reach Toshiba support
Best Chromebook on the market
good chromebook for the price, but UI was too small without changing settings after taking it out of the box<br/><br/>i had to change the resolution before my eyes started bleeding<br/><br/>definitely install crouton to run Ubuntu or other Linux systems side by side with Chrome OS<br/><br/>while installing crouton on a SD card, it's best to use an app to keep the chrombook awake at all times so that problems with mounting/unmounting the SD card doesn't arise, I suggest this app https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keep-awake/bijihlabcfdnabacffofojgmehjdielb?hl=en<br/><br/>otherwise if the screen turns off, then the chromebook seems to unmount the SD card which causes problems while setting up a system using crouton, and you get input output errors with the SD card, this has also been posted before http://askubuntu.com/questions/610780/trusty-on-sd-card-under-crouton-corrupted-disk<br/><br/>it's a very useful machine once crouton is installed, otherwise functionality is very limited
Fantastic buy. Got this to complement my ailing Macbook Pro, though it turns out I almost exclusively use the Chromebook now. Light, great battery life, and GREAT screen, especially for the cost. As long as you know what Chromebooks are meant to be used for, this is a fantastic value.
Excellent battery life, great display. No fan, and very quiet. I prefer this in many ways over my chromebook pixel, which has bad battery life and is always getting hot and turning on the fan. The display isn't as great as the pixel, of course. But overall it's a very handy machine
The full monitor and color display are awesome. I've never used a Chromebook before I guess I was expecting something more like a laptop. I'm not a techno genius but not a dummy either so it's taking me  awhile to figure how to operate it but that's my problem not the machines.
Excellent laptop with a screen that is as good as the Macbooks.  I wish it had a faster processor, but for the price you cannot beat this.  One frustration is our older printer is not cloud enabled so we still have to use the old Windows computer to print.  Super happy overall.
Amazing product. i knew right away this was the one judging by the large volume of positive reviews.. the screen is AMAZING. crystal clear, amazing colors, super bright. Battery life is top notch. Everything runs smoothly and quickly as well.<br/><br/>Don't hesitate. Buy it!
Love this laptop, goodbye pc and Mac
It is exactly what I wanted as a vacation/traveling computer. I love the HD screen. It is very snappy when accessing the web. I loved the price. Toshiba has introduced a new version the CB35-B3350 and reviewing the specs the main difference that I see is a backlit keyboard.
i received this chromebook 1 week ago...now i love it, it's fantastic, incredibly fast. the price is very good and i recommend this chromebook because it's a fantastic laptop if you have a powerfull pc at home.
It's 20 years I use computers. I'm specialist in informatic.<br/>It's the first chromebook we buy. I bought it for my father, but we didn't think about the most important thing for him: printing. Printer is not usable on this PC. So I gave it to my girlfriend, she was unhappy, but now she loves it.<br/><br/>CONS: Chromebook has a lot of limitations, it's useful if you need just use facebook and online services.<br/>CONS: You can't edit a picture with a software, you need online website to do that<br/>CONS: You can't install skype!!!<br/>CONS: You can't install drivers for external interfaces, be sure you won't need some printer, external network card, or everything external<br/><br/>PRO: But, it's really really nice to use online. It's fast, really fast<br/><br/>CONS: It change wifi network with no advice, always jumping from one network to other, looks like a gsm handover, and sometimes connect to slower networks i don't want<br/><br/>PRO: Nice colors on display<br/>CONS: Display reflects the light, mirror effect, not strong like other laps, but it's not matte finished<br/><br/>PRO: Really light, stay cold, even if we live in caribe<br/>PRO: For the price, it's the BEST choice you can do, it's the best chromebook i used<br/>CONS: Installing lot of extensions on chrome, change behavior of the lap, chrome fails to evaluate html and css, showing lines on websites<br/>PRO: I love the lap<br/><br/>CONS: I don't like chrome OS.<br/>PRO: Mouse clicking and mouse pad good quality.<br/>CONS: Missing caps lock<br/><br/>After 4 months of use, always perfect.
It started freezing 2 weeks after purchase and after 1 month the screen went black. Now trying to return it.  Youtube could only be watched for 5 minutes at a time. Some kind of video problem I am guessing.
A great product for day to day use.  The Chrome environment suits my needs as a teacher perfectly.  The screen is great and the battery does quite good on day to day tasks and web surfing.  Running video on the screen tends to eat the battery up quite quickly though.
I love tthis chromebook! Its fast, easy and looks good! I read all reviews before my purchase and I agree with a few who said the text is small but i still give it five stars because that doesnt bother me and  overall its a great little computer. It also shipped very fast!
I wanted to wait a couple of weeks to review the Chromebook to make sure I was utilizing it in the best way possible. I LOVE IT! I have always had a Dell and now this little machine has freed me from the clutches of Microsoft. Even if I am just surfing the web.
First time with a Chrome Book....very easy to get through and user friendly even if you aren't a geek...wished I would have tried this years ago...very nice graphics and solid state too! Great price and won't be looking for anything else...this is it!!!
By far the best display on any chromebook I've seen to date. I don't think I'll ever purchase another laptop without an IPS LCD like this one. Quality build and solid keyboard. This is a go.
I love it! Exactly what I was looking for, cheap (in price), yet fast and has an amazing screen. My only complaint is the trackpad, it's not as smooth as I would like it, so moving the cursor is a little bit annoying (but that is a small complaint).
This is a good buy with plenty of memory and a vast amount of battery use time,like 9 to 10 hours,at least in it's newer stage.Google Chrome took a small amount of usage to adapt to,but overall a fantastic and lightweight computer for everyday use.
Overall I am really pleased with thia Chromebook. It is very well constructed but is very light to carry, has a great keyboard and a brilliant screen. Perhaps, though, it could be a bit faster. What I do not know is if the slightly slow speed is a function of the fact that the Chromebook is uploading/downloading to the cloud. I love the concept of keeping all my folders and files in the cloud via the Google Drive app. Obviously, that is inherently slower than storing/opening my files from an internal hard drive. Also, until I am connected to the National Broadband Network (fibre optic), I am subject to how busy my ADSL connection is (which is a very good reason for the Australian government to stop stuffing around and get on with the job). I would love to compare it with the Google Chromebook Pixel which have a choice of i5 or i7 processors to see whether that speeds things up a bit. To be fair, I am not talking slow slow, just a bit slow compared to uploading/downloading to Google Drive on my PC. One thing that I have not tried yet is to connect my Chromebook directly to my ethernet (as my PC is connected) rather than by wi-fi. Maybe that is making a small difference in speed. I have to get a USB-ethernet connecter to do that because the chromebook does not have a direct ethernet plug socket. I bought the chromebook for use away from my office, which is only about 20% of the time, so I am really happy with this Toshiba model.
This thing is great. Almost like a Macbook Air but three times cheaper, sharper screen, and of course you need to make do with just the chrome browser. I did put Ubuntu Linux on it as well but the person I bought it for wanted to keep it simple.
if you are looking for a basic web surfing email and YouTube laptop this is the perfect machine<br/><br/>and the screen is worth the extra money and the 4GB of ram compared to other ones with only 2GB helps with lots on tabs open in chrome
I love my Toshiba Chromebook 2!
This is a great Chromebook. When your connected you don't even know you're on a Chromebook. Even works well with slow/no internet. Bought a SD card to expand storage and for media consuming.Well constructed machine with good style.
This was a birthday gift for my mom and she totally loved it. It works great, it was easy for her to get adapted to it, it's fast and smooth and has a great look and feel. You cannot beat the price. I highly recommend this laptop.
Overall, very happy with the purchase of my first Chromebook. Unless you really, really, really need to process heavy graphics or data, you won't miss having a regular laptop. Let's hope I have the same sentiments a year from now!
This is the Cromebook for 2015. I got a second one for the 15 year old and my two Mac wife keeps taking mine. My hands bump the track pad when I type but that is the only thing I don't love about it. Great build and great value.
I bought this exclusively to access the internet and it totally met my expectations. It turns on really fast and that is what I wanted. The only thing I don't like is the size of the fonts but I can always zoom in if I want to.
No more software updates, boots in 8 seconds, signs in in 3. This is the perfect computer for people who hate computers. At this price, I'll get one for the whole family.
This is my first non-Mac computer ever (I had been a Macuser for 25+ years).  I love the way this machine looks and feels, and love the way it integrates with Google Drive, docs, sheets, gmail, etc.  Obviously cloud-based computing is the future, and I have very few regrets saying goodbye to Mac and jumping aboard Chrome, especially when you consider the amazingly low price tag for this machine.  Audio is great, and the screen is spectacular, as has been mentioned a lot.  I like the track pad and keyboard very much.<br/>  I do have a few reservations, however. First of all, I'm not a fan of Google Cloud printing.  It seems cumbersome and counter-intuitive.  Basically I have to connect one of my old Macs to my printer in order to print.  This is an annoyance.  It would be nice to simply connect to any printer via the cloud rather than have to go through my Mac.<br/>  Secondly, the bluetooth doesnt seem to connect very well.  I have a speaker through which I listen to music, and while my phone interacts well with the speaker, audio from the chromebook often sounds fuzzy and staticy.  I am new to bluetooth technology, however, and willing to admit I may be doing something wrong.<br/>Those are minor quibbles though.  I'm very happy with this machine.  At this price, the quality is unbelievable.
This is the simplest laptop to use! So far no problems as I have read when i browsed all the negative reviews, ie cracked screens and pixel problems! For under 300 beans ya cant go wrong for simple browsing and watching stuff!
15 year old daughter bought it with her own savings.  Uses it everyday at school and home.  Lightweight, easy to transport.  Perfect answer for a busy household battling over the family laptop for homework, netflix, etc.
I needed a device for Internet only and this has been perfect. Starts up quick. Battery life is good. I can have multiple applications going at the same time with no issue. Very happy with what I received for the price.
I bought this chromebook for school and to do some browsing and i have no complaints. Easy to use, fast for its category and quiet. Just as advertised. Battery life is a big plus about 7 hours. I Definitely recommend it
oh my. love love love it.  it turns on quickly, charges quickly. and the battery lasts a long long time.  it's light.  i'm in love.  and i have several friends who plan on buying their own.  they covet my computer
The screen is excellent, clear, good viewing angles.  Very happy with chrome OS and this laptop.  Volume is a little low but I use it with wireless bluetooth headphones most of the time so it did not matter to me.
I have had several expensive laptops and this Toshiba Chromebook is better than all of them. Granted it can't do everything but for what I do, web based, it's perfect. I have had no problems with it and love it.
so far so good.  cant handle more than 4-6 tabs open at a time.  video is usually choppy as it just doesn't have enough juice.  especially if you have facebook open.  screen is great and perfect for traveling.
Just buy it. If you were thinking about getting a chromebook, this one is definitely the most bang for your buck. I love everything about this chromebook, but there is one thing that is kind of annoying at times. When viewing a video or pictureswith a lot of dark areas, i noticed a little display bleeding on the bottom and top corners of the screen. It is only noticeable with dark videos but it really is not a deal breaking. It is very small and hard to notice at first. The screen is still gorgeous, even with the small display bleeding.  Again if you were thinking about buying this product just do it, and trust me you will not regret it.
This device met all my expectations. Stunning display and great for students needing quick access to the Internet. Google cloud is also becoming more powerful and useful when accessed through this device.
Quick, light, and stylish, it exceeded my expectations. The chrome book is great for bringing to class because of it's convenient size. Very very stylish too (looks like a macbook). I highly recommend it.
For me, this is the best Chromebook for the money you can buy. The display is amazing, the sound is loud and clear. The keyboard is the only weak spot as the keys stick occasionally and it isn't backlit.
A little slow, so not made for heavy amounts of processor/graphic intense work. Very Very good for school work, word processor, research, etc.<br/>The screen is extremely pleasant to look at. I love it.
The Chromebook is equipped with a high resolution beautiful display, since the keyboard is also firm, work is very expedite.<br/>I think that it is a very good product with excellent cost performance.
This is a great device. I noticed getting compliments on it due to the screen. People think it's a $500 laptop. The one jist I have is the display monitor is flimsy and I feel Incould break it easily.
I've been using this for almost a year without any issues whatsoever. Not sure what's out these days, but this was the one to get when it came out. I still use it daily and it's great for what it is.
Excellent laptop computer. Instant on. Fast loading when surfing the web. Plenty of useful apps. It sure beats Windows or my Mac book air. I would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a chrome book.
One of the better Chromebooks out there. The sound is really good for a unit of this size (and this price). The text on the screen does get a little small - so consider that when getting this model.
Only what i was expecting
works well with case logic 13.1 inch case.  Resolution goes one step above 1080p.  Text becomes very tiny, but readable.  Battery lasts around 9-10 hours watching movies at a decent brightness.
Added a USB 3.0 flash drive; with Chrome OS and Crouton ubuntu I have a think & 3lb laptop to serve all my mobile computing needs. Quite happy with the decision to go with the IPS HD display.
Toshiba Chromebook has the best in resolution, except the keyboard is not the same as the regular laptop such as there is no up, down, left and right arrow keys.  It is a bit inconvenient.
Wonderful!  Easiest to use of all I have ever tried.  Internet-connection-necessary isn't really a problem - I was always connected with the other computers I have had before anyway.
Great chrome book for my teen. Nice larger size yet still compact enough for school.  Good price. Does exactly what he needs it for.
Not a fan of tablets or laptops but very happy with this purchase.  Got for casting to tv. Works great.  Got wireless mouse to use and find myself using more than I thought I would.
I love it!  It boots very fast,no hangups,no need for anti-virus.<br/>The HD screen is awesome.<br/>Since it's a 13.3 screen I increase font size to make it easier to read for me.
easy. simple and cheap.
A solid machine for basic browsing, word processing, streaming, etc. HD screen is very impressive, although the HDMI output isn't compatible with older VGA protectors and monitors.
I've had it for just under a month. It is a very nice browser machine.<br/>The screen is *wonderful*<br/>I bought it to run things I do through Chome and it does that very well.
Easy to activate if you remember your Google password....seems like a nice simple computer for someone who needs to go online but HATES computers...blood pressure has to be lower.
Quality computer for the price. Can handle everyday computing with no issues whatsoever. If you want a good computer without spending an arm or a leg, this is the best one out
Pleased with it, the battery life is one of the great aspects of this chromebook. It's a light use/travel laptop, so if you don't expect more from it you'll be happy with it.
great screen, good keyboard & reasonably well built.<br/><br/>speed is acceptable.<br/><br/>battery time is great been using for over 5 hrs still has about 45% batt left
Bought this in the hope of replacing my dying Macbook Pro. So far so good. The scrolling is a bit jarring but hopefully there will be a software update to remedy that.
Love this thing, writing this review on it now.  Definitely a toy, not a tool so much (at least not for development or optimization), but worth the money for sure.
Beautiful display, fluid and fast processing and a lightweight body make this an amazing computer. Do not know why it is cheap. Faster than windows by a long shot.
I like this computer, but as time goes on I'm seeing the pitfalls of a chromebook. For Internet use its great, but I didn't realize there's so little I can download because it's not windows or Mac. I know that's my fault because I didn't do my research well enough. That being said I hate windows 8 and I didn't have the money to spend on a Mac so I chose this one. Over all it's fast, easy to use and does what I need it to do(mostly) for the price it works well.
Awesome computer. Great screen. Killer battery life. Perfect for web applications and as a portable screen to access your main computer via remote desktop or VNC.
Bought this about six months ago--it's been great.  It does everything you want in a Chromebook, has great speakers and an excellent display.  Very, very happy.
Exactly what I was looking for, cheap. My only complaint is the trackpad, it's not as smooth as I would like it, so moving the cursor is a little bit annoying.
Excellent value at the price.  Wish it had a backlit keyboard and that the trackpad didn't feel as cheap as it does, but all in all this was a great purchase.
just perfect for my internet needs.. quick...very easy to use...no problem working on my presentations in cloud...and the screen resolution is the best ever!
This little machine is amazing.  Does everything I need.  There is a learning curve about documents, excel equivalent, and laptops but they are not hard.
light weight with excellent screen. You trade a little speed for fanless / noiseless / barely-warm-during-operation device. You do need the 4GB version.
Wonderful. More than met our expectations. Beautiful screen. Quick enough. Light. Good battery. Great wifi.
I bought it for my husband. He was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the hardware. He had already been sold on the Chromebook Functionality.
Purchased this based on the positive reviews and was not disappointed.  Screen looks great, and was able to get up and running on it within 5 minutes.
I switched from a Macbook air and this works just fine.  The build is plastic, but the keyboard feels good and the screen is great.  Very good value!
I purchased this for my son March 2015 at his request.  He loves it.  He hooks it up to his tv and watches videos and movies all while laying in bed.
i have no idea how this laptop can be so affordable ; it does pretty much everything u ask of it. One of the best purchases I've made in a long time
Excellent machine for almost everything you need to do. Up and going waaaaaaay faster than my windows laptop. Love it, best laptop I've had so far.
Got this for my daughter for college... emails, browsing, papers and online movies — has everything she needs and wants, best deal for the price.
overall good Chromebook. Just adjusting to the new Chromebook world. Difficulty adjusting to saving and sharing documents in appropriate format
Phenomenal Chromebook. Great screen, long battery, and fast performance make this Chromebook a joy to use for web browsing and video watching.
i absolutely love my new laptop computer.  Its fast and is lightweight. The size of the screen is perfect.  And I thought the price was good.
is now my go-to internet device and my MacBook Pro is only opened and started when I have to do some major computing, which has been minimal.
I love it, but I HATE one thing -- the fonts at the top bar of chrome are TINY. Otherwise I use this machine ALL DAY LONG and I love it!
It's my first time to try chrome OS and i like it.<br/><br/>This toshiba is very good and the screen very nice.<br/><br/>I love it.
Bought this for my fiance as a replacement for her aging Windows laptop. Many months later she is a happily converted Chromebook user!
Very well built quality.Works great with HD display and long enough 6hr+ battery life. The audio from skull candy is quite impressive.
i am pleased so far in what this little book can do. still learning and exploring. m/need wireless printer and i should be good to go.
I thought for sure this would be a good replacement for my HP14, but I was wrong.<br/><br/>I gave my father my HP14. Looking forward to upgrading to a newer model and a better screen I ordered myself the Toshiba CB35-B3340 13.3 with the high res. screen. Let me just say, the screen quality was great...as long as I used a magnifying glass. I'm 51 and I need reading glasses, but with the HP14 on my lap I had not problems seeing it at all. With this high res screen, everything was so small I could see anything. Yes, I could decrease resolution making everything bigger, but then what's the point of having a full res. screen?<br/><br/>So, overall a pretty good computer but if you have older eyes you might want to look elsewhere.
Bought this for my wife, she absolutely loves it.  Doesn't use her Windows HP laptop at all anymore.  She even bought a cover for it.
Excellent. Great screen and sound. Fast start up. Have to get used to Google apps but it's a small price to pay for the performance.
While I'm still setting this up I am finding it pretty intuitive and easy to navigate.  I think I'm going to love this Chromebook!
loved everything about it...except the font was too small for my dad on the taskbar...need to see if there is a way to enlarge it
Best Chromebook available - the screen is just incredible and way better than my Macbook Air screen.<br/>Don't hesitate, buy it.
OMG, I love this thing!  I was reluctant to go with Chromebook, but it's ease of use is perfect for me.  As long as you don't do heavy video / photo editing (there are apps with light editing available), and if you don't need the deeper functions of MS Office, you'll be fine.  I think for the price the quality of this laptop is great.  Last night my friend, who is a tech admin at a school district and has a Macbook Air, asked when I got an Air when he saw this on the table.  Great computer, no reservations.  The only negative I read about in the reviews was that they battery wasn't as good as some Chromebooks, which is to be expected with the great screen.  However, this has not been an issue for me.
This computer is awesome so far i like it , but the letters are tiny , i dont recomend this product if you have vision problems.
For the $ this is a fast machine and serves many purposes.  Can't yet fully replace a conventional laptop,  but getting closer.
I had the original Toshiba 13.3 and this is even better. The screen is fantastic, best Chromebook on the market in my opinion.
It is a very good little chrome book. Great display and easy to use. It's for my daughter who is in grade 7 and works great.
This Chromebook is awesome, the HD screen is really nice and he sound is great. In addition, the performance is great also.
I am so glad I made the jump to a Chromebook and this one is perfect! Great seller communication and arrived ahead of time!
Just got this over the weekend. Prime doesn't disappoint. My daughter loves it. I think I am going to get my husband one.
Amazing computer, fast, the battery last for good 8 to 9 hours.  The chrome Os is very impressive,  I done with Windows..
Very happy with the speed web pages load. Screen quality good. Track pad requires a harder tough than others I've used.
I love my chromebook.  It boots up fast.  It's ideal for me and the things that I do on a computer.  And the price was
Could not be happier. Met every expectation and exceeded many of them. Blazing fast. Easy to use. Highly recommended!
amazing the picture in this chromebook is very beautiful. I love it so much. it is very fast I had no issues with it.
Unable to connect to my network "out of range".  Despite the chromebook showing full bars and SID of my router...  I tried pretty much everything I could think of...<br/>I have a Netgear WNR3500Lv2<br/>1. With SEC<br/>2. Without SEC<br/>3. MAC filtering<br/>4. Several reboots of router and chrome book..
Got mine three days ago and have been using 24/7 for school and movies. Make sure you get a class 10 SD card for the storage expansion.<br/><br/>Nearly all the new chromebooks get stuck on initial startup. After you put in all your info and it gets stuck on the next step just restart it and it will be fine. I recommend going into settings/advanced settings/about and changing your version to beta mode.<br/><br/>Have fun!
Seriously the perfect laptop for school. As a vet tech student this has everything you need. Fast and reliable.
Love it. Fast, quick and the O'S was easy to learn. Had to Google some things but the I formation is out there.
My high school daughter seems to get all her work done on this and is getting straight A's so I can't complain.
We love this computer. We use it mostly for general internet surfing and Netflix watching. It is a great deal.
Love this chromebook - the screen, keyboard and form in particular are excellent for such a good value device.
I wanted to love this chrome book. Display and sound are great - when they work. But it no longer works and Toshiba offers no help. The trackpad no longer responds and won't even work with a mouse attached. So it completely worthless now, and will just go in the trash.
Everything so good as what I read on peoples reviews. Especially so fast to turn on, just in several seconds.
Light, great display, good battery, great OS.  This is now the family go-to machine with logins for everyone.
This is a great Chromebook!! I love it!! It came well packaged and arrived on time!! I use it everyday!! Peg
It's is a great browsing tool, but terrible if you do anything else. This is for the light internet surfer.
Bought this a week ago off Amazon and it won't power on and the charging light doesn't light up when it's plugged in but it does get hot and you can hear it humming like electricity is going through it when it's plugged in. Is this computer fried? I knew it was fanless but I thought there would be some kind of system to keep it from overhearing if that's what the issue is. Wondering if I should have it replaced with another or look for a different computer altogether. I went with chromebook because it was all I needed but if the s***'s only gonna last a week no thanks.
Far above my expectations- its fast light and reliable. Even the power cord is small light and functional.
What more could you want, especially for the price.  The screen is fantastic, but it does give some glare.
Very pleased.
I bought this for a roommate of my son, who is not exactly flush with cash but she is approaching graduation. Her PC was dead and she was in a bad spot.<br/><br/>This unit has a beautiful screen, very good (surprisingly so) built in audio and just a little more RAM than other units in this price range. It has an SD card slot so you can easily store more than the built in memory provides.<br/><br/>It is a very good value and is highly recommended IF YOU SIMPLY NEED A WEB BROWSER. In my case, it was perfect for a college senior with the entire curriculum being  web based.
This is a really good Chromebook, with a nice display and keyboard.<br/><br/>The display is really, really nice. And according to a couple of reviews I read it covers 98% of the sRGB spec and with a delta E of just 1, pretty amazing, not even high spec laptops around $1000 achieve this kind of color fidelity.<br/><br/>Will update if I find something to complain about.
It's great, the picture is really good, lightweight - excellent purchase. I got the protection plan too.
Love this Chromebook. It performs really well, its fast and very light and the screen looks fantastic!
Super fast and dependable - I own 4 Chromebooks and this one has the best screen I have seen so far.
This item arrived quickly and was just what I wanted. It was for my son's birthday, and he loved it!
Great notebook for everything i need. Superfast startup everytime!
Great machine, does everything I need it to do. Highly recommend.
The one laptop per child non profit organization could never make a computer this good this cheap
Love it, perfect for my needs as a student in university and leisure time for videos/web browsing
It works for what I want it to do, I don't have a lot of big needs for a lap top so it's perfect.
I'm very satisfied with this Chromebook. I don't know why they sale it in Peru neither in Japan.
Perfect for my use. Glad to rid myself of all the Window crap, extra security, constant updates.
Love the Chromebook 2.  It is quick, lightweight, good graphics. holds a long charge, plus more.
I love how fast it is, how long the battery lasts and pretty good speakers and volume for audio
The display is great!<br/><br/>Google has come so far in getting a viable desktop. I bought an acer 720 9 months ago. It was marginal at best. Then the automatic chromeos updates kept improving it. Now a chromebook is a serious competitor to 'regular' desktops. And when you factor in the price, it is a no brainer.<br/><br/>I worked many years in software and I now develop on the chromebook. What a transformation.<br/><br/>$300. 1080p isp display. USB 2/3. 801ac. Sd card. Really all you need.
I love the quality of the screen.  I love the fact that the battery last as long as is stated.
Love it. Works great. Screen is amazing. Who needs a full overpriced laptop? CHROMEBOOK ROCK!!
Beautiful picture and decent speakers , great for those that just want to surf the Internet !!
ahhhhhhhhhhhh I absolutely love my chromebook.... I don't know how i lived with out it before
Could not play media files such as music or videos, other than that it was a good computer
Fantastic product. This beats any laptop I have ever owned. Never going back to Microsoft.
great so far, haven't had any problems. Perfect for me since I really just use internet.
One of the best products I have ever purchased.  I will buy another if this one breaks.
It is a great chromebook, beautiful bright screen. Great battery life, around 8 hours.
Screen broke after a few months. Worst customer service routes you to different people and wont help. Many people are having screen issues with this laptop within their warranty period but Toshiba refuses to acknowledge the issue and honor their warranty. Avoid purchasing this computer.
pretty light, easy to carry to college for studying. i want to play games on it lol
The Mrs. is VERY happy with this laptop...simple and gets the job done
Wish there were more tutorials to get you started but overall great
New Chromebook of Toshiba. A model of the high performance.<br/>A screen of the IPS liquid crystal for which I was waiting eagerly. And full HD.<br/>The capacity of the memory is 4GB. CPU is fast. A body will be small.<br/>The price is rising according to the performance.<br/><br/>When being cheap, those are "lower machine" for the 2GB which isn't a IPS screen. Therefore please be careful about confirmation of the model number.<br/><br/>A wasteful part was shaved, so a body was small. So it became easy to put in a bag.<br/>A power supply adapter is also miniaturized. The shape that the body insertion isn't bulky.<br/>So it became easy to take out in outside.<br/><br/>The color of the outward appearance changes to white silver and is fresh. There is a grain of a skid.<br/><br/>Wright from a power supply key of a keyboard who worried from before doesn't leak. It's improved.<br/><br/>< the part which isn't good><br/>USB3.0 port was 2 so far. USB2.0 is the left and USB3.0 is the right. Each 1 for each.<br/>I think a mouse is usually connected and you connect a USB memory to a high-speed port, so this may be OK.<br/><br/>The click of a touch pad is too firm. When a mouse is used, the problem is canceled.<br/><br/>The angle where a screen opens was changed to (90+30) deg from (90+45) deg, and it became small.<br/><br/>Many cost reductions are done, but that isn't reflected by the price.<br/>A screen became easy to see, but the convenience is same compared with the previous model. A rise part of the CPU performance is used for resolution UP, and seems to be cancellation.<br/>When I wish for a low price, the previous model is recommended.<br/><br/>But the picture of IPS liquid crystal of full HD is very clean, and it's easy to see and it's comfortable. Even the small character is clear. A rise of a few prices can be permitted.<br/><br/>< about Chromebook><br/>Chromebook is to restrict use, and the movement is light.<br/>There is also a case which can't be used instead of a PC of course.<br/>Therefore I use Chromebook as the one which strengthens the part of the PC.<br/><br/>A net search is the most part at present for the use purpose of a PC.<br/><br/>There is often a case that you make wait by a system renewal by a start-up of a PC.<br/>When hurrying with a wonder, it often happens.<br/>Such tool isn't useful.<br/><br/>Chromebook stands up quickly.<br/>And a net search is strongest.<br/>Youtube can be read. And a document can be made.<br/><br/>Use of Chromebook was mainly, and it was very less to use a PC.<br/>When understanding and using the place which should be used, Chromebook is a very good machine.
Excellent chromebook. Only negative is the somewhat flimsy screen.
Awesome little laptop for streaming and other lite computer work.
All features work well. Especially like the Skullcandy speakers.
Exactly what I wanted and needed. Light weight and quick laptop.
Laptop screen cut out after a day or so of use. No physical damage (screen and laptop in perfect condition). Would rather have a replacement sent out than have to return it and wait for refund and rebuy.
The screen is pretty good.<br/>The battery life is great.<br/>The speakers aren't too quiet, like many laptops.<br/><br/>My only criticism is that it doesn't have enough graphics/processing power to play Netflix.<br/>Netflix is partially to blame, since HD YouTube videos stream just fine. But still, no netflix == bummer.
Great product at a great price! I'd order again in a heartbeat!
Amazingly well performance, beautiful screen, long battery life
Fast. Good feel to keyboard. Nice  tactile case. Light weight.
First Time Chromebook owner...Perfect for media consumption!!!
I love this computer. The reviews here were really acurate.
Very, very happy with purchase. Great machine, great value.
Love it.  Lightweight.  Easy to travel with.  Great screen.
Great price, great quality! Love that it's so light-weight!
my screen cracked does anyone know were i can get a new one
The screen is really nice. Great resolution for this size.
My niece loves it! She is in high school and its perfect.
works well for surfing the internet.  good video quality.
Bought for my son! He loves it. Is a great 1st computer.
Loved it. Replaced my laptop and very happy with choice.
Great little computer. Love the high definition screen.
Get chromeOS laptop for the price
Got to love the Keep It Simple Stupid ( KISS ) format.
Warning to all: please read the people who have 1/2 star reviews - it appears we are all having the same issue with this particular computer and it appears Toshiba is a shotty company to begin with.<br/><br/>If i could give this zero stars I would.  We bought this computer May 25 and used it a handful of times.  Between my wife and I, we've used it twice for a movie and 3 times to pay bills and now there are lines going through the screen.<br/><br/>We spent 2 hours on the phone with Toshiba only to find out that it wasn't covered under warranty and that we would need to take it to a repair shop and spent $390 on a new screen (45 miles away.).<br/><br/>I'm done with Toshiba and their terrible service.  I'm selling this computer for parts and going back to a brand with better customer service and higher quality.
Fantastic product for price and costruction qualità
Great value for the money. Replaced my MacBook Air.
Awesome for school with the battery lasts all day
Just cant seem to figure out how to print yet...
Fabtastic screen and ultrafast Googleexperience!
Screen broke 6 months after purchase. Toshiba will not honor warranty because serial number is worn off bottom and Amazon will not look it up due to policy. Poor quality product and poor customer service from both Amazon and Toshiba.
Mine was stolen this week.  I liked it so much I immediately ordered a new one.  Well done Toshiba.<br/><br/>Arrived with a strip of vertical dead pixels 2/3 of the way along the screen.  Seems perfect performance and otherwise.  I'll wait until the replacement unit arrives before full comment.<br/><br/>Update:<br/><br/>The replacement unit arrived and after playing with it for a few hours I can say I'm extremely happy.  Does everything it should do.  The screen especially is fantastic on a machine in this price range (and in fact for higher price ranges).<br/><br/>Processor seems adequate and the fanless design is actually really nice.<br/><br/>Keyboard is good.<br/><br/>The Skullcandy sound might be a bit of a gimmick, but the sound is really good and music and movies benefit.<br/><br/>The usual caveat around Chromebooks applies, but since 99% of my computer usage is in chrome anyway I love it.<br/><br/>Two weeks of real world usage later:<br/><br/>I love this thing.  It's my go-to machine for most things.  Battery seems to last a whole day just fine.  ChromeOS has its quirks but overall I don't miss a "real" OS (I've used Windows/OSX/Ubuntu extensively).  Can't recommend this thing more highly.
I adore my toshiba. It's so easy & fun to use
A great Chromebook that is a bit too under powered. It has 4GB RAM but a weaker Intel processor that clearly struggles to even load web pages. Wish it has the power of the Acer C720 but still maintain the fantastic screen quality. This CB has the best display I have ever seen in my life and pictures doesn't do it justice. Its a pleasure to watch HD videos on this budget notebook which is the main reason I decided to keep it. I also like the fact that it doesn't get fingerprints and other oily stuff no matter how long you use it as a result of its rough aluminum finish. The keyboard is a bit rough at first but one can easily get used to it. Keyboard is great and the built in Skullcandy sound is great as well. There are a lot of other great stuff about this CB but at the end the its best strength is the display. The other thing I am not sure of is the internal SSD which I am not sure if it can be upgraded. If not then I guess the micro SD card can help to increase the local storage since the 16 GB storage may not be enough for everyday use.
I bought my Toshiba Chromebook 4 months ago. The touchpad no longer works which renders the enter machine mostly useless (if I wanted to have to use a USB mouse, I would have bought a desktop). I have not dropped or mishandled my laptop - the trackpad has simply stopped working due to normal usage. I really liked most things about this machine - however, it is absolutely useless now so I cannot give it more than 1 star.<br/><br/>To top things off, Toshiba provides almost no customer support. In fact, you have to PAY FOR CUSTOMER SUPPORT OVER THE PHONE. Yep, that's right. Toshiba wants to nickel and dime you over their shoddy products.<br/><br/>I will say that this review should not be taken as an indictment of ChromeOS in general. I absolutely love the operating system and Google customer support. With Google, I was able to voice chat with an agent within a few minutes and we were able to sort out that the issue is on the hardware side.<br/><br/>If you are looking into a Chromebook, definitely get one. Just don't get this one.
Great computer, easy to use, and very fast.
This computer met our needs and works fine.
I love a chrome book. I just wish that they would have a dvd hard drive to go with it so I can watch the once in a while movie that I already own. Thanks Toshiba for making a quality computer for a little money
Excellent for the money.
lapto pretty fast excellent recommend it.
Great device for the price. Great screen.
Best Chromebook! Would highly recommend!
Best chromebook available.  Great screen
After a day, I'm still deciding if it's worth keeping vs. just using my wifes C720, which says alot about it. And at $329 don't spend hours of your life trying to figure it out reading reviews that look like short novels for god sake!<br/><br/>every machine has it's compromises - this is very nice now, and is probably overpriced by $75, but in 6 months there will be other chromebooks with a nice display/processor combo, sure it works nice, surfs fine. Very satisfied for a silly $350 - if you drop it or lose it, NBD!<br/>First impressions out of box:<br/>Needed to plug charger in to boot it up which is a first for any electronic item I've bought.<br/>Display: better than my acer C720. But I was immediately needing to make a compromise between super tiny font size with very sharp detail or a lesser resolution. So you will be switching back and forth and zooming to find what works best for you. I'm sitting with 1536 resol. for now.<br/>Design Form factor: the best for now, except one very important aspect - the front edge where you rest your palm to use trackpad is very sharp (pictured)  (not comfortable but will get used to, it just makes me want to grab a large wood file and take the edge off!)<br/>Speed on opening cover to surf: wifi reconnects, a little slower than my acer - but totaling maybe 5 seconds or so<br/>Keypad: nice, not sure why they don't include a ".com" key like my phone does<br/><br/>vent: windows 8 is for kids and senior citizens, who has the time to spend trying to navigate that type of system? the OS is not usable - I've been using google system for 5 years for personal and business because it's clean with little clutter.<br/>update: I'm keeping it, it works well and is efficient for a 13". In this moment, it's the best we can do at $350!
My son loves the speed and ease of use.
Boots easily and hassle free browsing.
Great computer - great fast delivery.
one of the best Chromebook out there.
It is exactly what I was looking for.
I give this Chromebook top marks for the quality of the screen. It really is the best screen out there on a Chromebook (except maybe the Pixel). I returned this Chromebook because of 2 things:  the constant lag due to it being under-powered and the poor build quality. After returning this one, I purchased the Acer Chromebook with the Intel i3 processor and it excels exactly where this one suffers - extremely good processing power and memory, which means no lag at all on websites. The build quality on this Toshiba is terrible - it feels like a toy.<br/><br/>The reason for 3 stars is that this screen is the best out there - particularly for this price range. I just had to make a choice between better processing power and better screen quality. My dream Chromebook would have both, but then I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to get it in this price range.
Great screen, pretty good performer.
The best computer I have ever owned.
amazing Chromebook...i just love it!
Its a great computer for the price.
Fantastic computer!
Amazing computer for the price.
I absolutely love this laptop!
The Good:<br/><br/>-IPS Screen is beautiful<br/>-Fast enough for almost everything I do (I currently have 31 tabs open and no lag)<br/>-Sound is good<br/>-Battery life of 6-7 hours with normal use and good brightness<br/>-There is an app for everything I need<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>Build quality. A screw fell out along with one of the rubber feet on the bottom. Screen pops out occasionally and I just noticed that there are purple smudges in the screen. I don't abuse my laptop or anything so I have no idea why this may have happened. It may just be a faulty unit.<br/><br/>All in all I think this is a wonderful computer, especially for the price.
I was looking for some time for something to just hang out and wander the internet with, I had an iPad but got tired of the limitations<br/>I have a Surface Pro and a keyboard but due to the keyboard being soft it doesn't really work on your lap.<br/>I wanted something I could use to Chromecast easily and was in a laptop format.<br/>Cheap laptops can be had but they tend to be heavy with terrible screens and Windows still needs some decent hardware to run properly<br/>So I thought I'd check out a Chromebook, I saw this screen in Bestbuy and was sold.<br/>Bought a refurb for an insane price and love it.<br/>Chrome has a few quirks like no right click from the trackpad - well actually you have to double click or use alt+click<br/>I've had one issue with Shockwave Flash crashing on one site but other than that I love it.<br/>The 13.3 is great for my aging eyes<br/>I love the very lightweight laptop format<br/>I knew the limitations of Chrome OS but was OK for my purposes<br/>I haven't opened a zillion tabs or worked on documents and I likely won't<br/>This is my device for surfing while watching TV not something I intend on working on
Amazing best chromebook ever
Nice display and good gadget
Computer was fine for six months, then the screen went completely black (not an unusual problem with this machine, as it turns out).  We would have been happy with a repair or replacement, but Toshiba is refusing to honor the warranty because the serial number isn' t legible on the back of the computer.  Terrible customer service
Solid functionality. Good battery life, even watching video. Good WIFI reception. Lightweight. Current favorite browsing device.
I would not order this item again. This stopped working just after the limited, and inadequate, 30 day Amazon return period.
It's even better than I expected. All I wanted. I bought it as an auxiliar device, but I'm using it for almost everything.
Very nice display and a decent chromebook. I found it to be a little to laggy compared to my previous HP 14 chromebook.
Chrome OS is like having a laptop form of an Android. It is web-based. Beautiful and sleek but not for an iPhone owner.
Great quality and price!
Perfect for my use case.
For what it is , it's an excellent product.  If you need a reasonably priced Chromebook this is a good choice.
Maybe slightly underpowered, but probably the best Chromebook out there. The display is, of course, very good.
Fantastic PC. Do development using crouton. Also utilize a 64Gb SD card. It fits flush so it can't be seen.
The Chromebook has a damage in a cover.
It's awesome and fast.
Great little machine.
I have been using the Toshiba Chromebook 2 for about 1 1/2 months and it has become the go to laptop for 95% of my needs.  Only downside - you may dread using your Windows PC's, if you have any.  I still prefer Excel so I do use my Windows PC occasionally, but Google Sheets is growing on me for less complex needs.<br/><br/>For some reason my eyes took some time adjusting to the screen.  Almost decided it was not for me and than after a few days the problem went away and has not returned. Very strange, still don't understand why, but I do have crappy eyesight and I am very light sensitive.<br/><br/>Another problem initially was very laggy, stuttering performance but once I eliminated a start page I had been using (ighome) and removed a few apps as suggested from doing some research on the web, it has been extremely fast.
The device stopped connecting to Wi-Fi, rendering it useless. Before that it worked perfectly.
A great little chromebook computer. It has met my expectations for my needs. It did take me a bit to get use to a non-windows computer, but I have found it to be a pleasant change. It performs well, with good battery life, almost an instant on (vs waiting forever for my windows computer), and the screen resolution is very nice. The chromebook is also very light weight. Making it easy to get up and move from one location to another.<br/><br/>The only downside (slightly) are the edges. Which is the reason for 4 stars vs 5 stars. The edges are a bit "sharp". If your like me. And rest your palms on the base while using the chromebook. After a while it can be annoying. If you don't. Then it will be no problem for you.<br/><br/>All in all. Very pleased it this chromebook.
screen is awesome (although when using max resolution text and icons on display look very small so i constantly enlarge view) and the sound is great. it's also great everything runs so fast i don't have to wait anymore as i did with my windows laptop.<br/>but, and it's a big but, if you're not used to work with google docs/sheets/slides you're gonna have some hard time adjusting to it as i still do. plus, sometimes i do want to to a little more than surfing the net and editing google docs, but anything involves any kind of program (and sometimes even add-ons) is impossible.<br/>it's great as a second laptop (provided your first isn't mac suffering it's own shortages..). it's a little less great as your sole laptop..
Beautiful display!
excelent thank you
Very nice computer
I've been using this machine for almost a year and it's still the best Chromebook in the $250-$300 range. My wife and I each have one, and it's the machine we reach for for 90% of the time at home, over an assortment of personal and work supplied laptops, desktops, and tablets.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>The 1080p IPS panel is a beautiful display -- near retina quality; the sound is surprisingly good for a laptop; the battery life is amazing; and the N2840 processor with 4GB RAM means you never have lag or stalls, even with multiple profiles and many tabs open.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The webcam is a bit mediocre and I would love to have a backlit keyboard. However, given the price, I wouldn't knock off a star for either.
Excellent so far. Holding off on 5th star until we have used it a bit longer.
Met expectations.
My wife loves it.
Exactly what I expected from my pre-purchase research.  I am very satisfied.
Totally awesome.
Unfortunately, it a bit slow.  Everything else is pretty good about it.  It is very, very, very slow!  They have an updated version with a faster processor which I highly recommend over this model.
You get what you pay for, and what you pay for is an outstanding laptop
Item was of poor quality - bought from Amazon Warehouse - and returned
First off my package was left outside the office i work at on a Sunday afternoon. I did not click the option for delivery on the weekends. If i did' go to the office that day, my Chromebook might have been gone. Very good looking, very slim and light.<br/>I'm experience issues with it every day. Sometimes i have to re-load or refresh the same page more than 3 times in order to open it. You know, I assumed it was called chromebook for a reasom to make out surfing online more enjoyable. Anyway i wouldn't buy it again or recommend  it  to any of my friends.
I looked at a lot of Chromebooks, and this one was one of the best.  the track pad is a little hard to get used to, and can be flaky.  Screen is small, but overall the trade off is a portable machine.  Battery life is awesome.  And, you cannot go wrong with a Linux backed OS.  I love that if the machine gets destroyed, I can pick up another and simply log in and start where I left off.  This is perfect for teens or people that have limited experience with computers.  Especially if they already have a Google/Gmail account set up already.
Very satisfied
had to get this coz my old macbook just isnt operatioal anymore.love its functionality and quality . good job toshiba ! . so glad i got this for my junior high daughter. great display and texts might be small at first, u can easily adjust them. perfect for web browsing the net than a tablet or phone. so user friendly. chrome ios is legit. i cant wait til they come out with a CB3 and a 15 inch chromebook. also, for a case, i highly reccomend this : http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QFS1EFG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1 by nuvur
This thing is amazing. Slick form factor, lightweight and packing a beautiful 1080p display. ChromeOS is perfect for web browsing and media consumption, but I've also installed Ubuntu as well (See Lifehacker's guide). Ubuntu allows for running handy programs like GIMP image editor, LibreOffice, VLC media player, etc. Chrome Remote Desktop app lets me remote into my home PC to play Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft flawlessly among other things.<br/><br/>Absolutely perfect for the price, and far more capable than many people assume it to be.
This is a good computer for basic web browsing but for researching and school work... Not so much!<br/>As a student I have to write a lotttt of papers and do a ton of research, have a bunch of tabs open at once, watch powerpoints, make PowerPoint, etc.. This is not the machine to do that on. I didn't realize chrome books were a completely different processing system and it wasn't compatible with all the necessary things I need for school.<br/>I really do like the design, price, light weight, and great graphics but it just doesn't fit my needs as a student.
This has been a headache. The keypad stopped working after 5 months. Now it has to be plugged in to turn on since the power button no longer works. Don't bother to buy an external DVD drive because it will not work to play videos. I recommend you keep looking.
Love it!
love it
Much better than my old Mac!
Incredibly light, incredibly fast, incredibly simple: this is a computer for people who don't need a whole computer but don't like the restrictions of a tablet.  You'll be so happy with the speed and simplicity that you'll forget you even have a tablet.
Love the chrome book; however, I wish we would have purchase the 15" Acer instead of the 13" Toshiba. I would have preferred the larger screen and faster processor compared to the full HD, as we mainly use the chromebook as an internet browser.
Excellent laptop.<br/><br/>Pro's<br/><br/>Build quality<br/>Crisp screen<br/>Decent volume<br/>Expandable Storage.<br/>Good 8+ hour battery<br/>Buyer condition was accurate, and was in good working order<br/>Con's<br/>Low internal storage
Excellent. Product perfect
The Toshiba Chromebook has been everything I hoped for. I have not yet found anything to question. It is light. fast and easy to operate and this last piece is really important to me; I am unsophisticated at best with technology.
Has lived up to all the good reviews I read before buying this. The screen is the star of the piece but it also has a very capable processor. No complaints so far. Knocks the socks off all other chromebooks I have seen so far.
Great!
The screen scrapped out after a week out of the box. Toshiba charged me 30 to ship it to them, then refused to repair it, claiming that the broken screen was my fault. I never even jostled the computer. Only opened and closed it gently. Never experienced anything like this in my life. Toshiba will never be given money by me again.<br/><br/>It was made to break upon touch.
Amazing product! Lightweight, sleek, and affordable. However, the screen font can be really hard to read at times and I wish there was more things to do on the actual system when working offline.
nice!
10/1/14I just got this chromebook, wow is fast, and the screen is beutiful, if you are thinking about purchasing this item, you will not be dissapointed<br/><br/>10/3/2014 after using this chromebook for a couple of days I did notice light bleading from the botton of the screen specially when the screen is completely black, is anybody else having this problem? or is this a defect on my unit, also the thin edes on the botton could cut into your wrist after a using it for a  while, I still love it though, if anyone else is having the ligh bleading of the botton of the screen, I would greatly appreciated if you could let me know if not I will exchange this unit, thanks in advance for all your help.
Much better then my Chromebook 1.  Found a problem with the OS.  When cursor/pointer is enlarged, the pointer is 2 characters off (behind).  Help system was no help at all.
I was in the market for a chromebook and did a lot of research to try and pick the best one for the price.  This Toshiba gets some good reviews if you look around at tech review sites.  However, it did give me pause to be buying a Toshiba.  You don't hear many people talk about Toshiba anymore.  And actually, they've been in the news lately, but for a bad reason.  Turns out they are in the middle of a $2billion accounting scandal.  (Google it!)  But I digress.  Anyway, the Toshiba arrived and worked perfectly.....well, let me correct that.....worked perfectly for all of about 2 months!  Then the screen started crapping out.  Weird wavy lines appeared all over it.  So I called Toshiba to get it replaced (as clearly at only 2 months old such a defect is not reasonable.)  Which first of all.....prepare to spend at least 45 minutes on hold.  Trust me, I had to call multiple times to try and get this resolved and it is a guaranteed 45 minutes or so on hold each time.  Also, prepare to bang your head against the wall trying to understand the accents of their customer service staff, as they are certainly not located anywhere near the United States.  Back to my story though....so they asked that I take photos of it and send it to them, which I did.  They in turn replied by saying....nope, my fault, I must have dropped it and cracked the screen (which is apparently what the lines are I'm seeing.)  I very politely explained to them 1) I certainly never did drop it, & 2) the lines are showing up on different parts of the screen every time I looked to see if it was working again......and last time I checked, cracks can't magically relocate themselves at will!  As in, the screen is not cracked!  There's something wrong with it on the inside.  Well.....multiple phone calls later, and multiple times having them accuse me over and over and over again of dropping it (you can tell they're reading from a script that tells them to say that to me), they outright refused to do anything about it.  They were quite content telling me that their piece of crap laptop that broke on it's own after only 2 months was 100% my problem.  So herein lies the lesson I hope to pass along to anyone reading this.  Turns out, and I've learned this the hard way, there is indeed a reason no one talks about buying a Toshiba anymore.  There's a reason people buy brands like Apple, Google, etc.  Those brands 1) do not make cheap quality products, 2) those brands do not risk their reputation trying to blame a customer for their own manufacturing defects, etc.  Yes, this Toshiba might be one of the less expensive chromebook options, and yes it supposedly has a nice screen (assuming you haven't spontaneously "cracked" it on your own), but again, there's a reason no one talks about buying a Toshiba anymore.  Cheap products, extremely poor customer service, accounting scandals......I think you get it.  BUYER BEWARE my friends.  BUYER BEWARE!  Spend a few extra bucks and get a chromebook from an actual reputable quality company. On the path they're on, it is only a matter of time before Toshiba disappears entirely into the dust bin of crappy, failed companies they surely are deserving of joining.  Don't make the same mistake I did.
Really nice resolution screen, great resources (have some 20 tabs open right now, and none of the memory issues other chromebooks have given me). Love this computer.
After delays with postage which was extremely disappointing the product met all expectations. Packaging was rough and i was surprised it arrived without damage.
Great screen, but if you are planning on watching things on youtube in 1080p60.  This is not the chromebook for you.  Other than that, it is great for browsing!
Bought this for my son. It's a chromebook, so not a true replacement for a full featured computer. Great for browsing the web, emails, and even some video.
Big ugly line appeared in the middle of the display after only a few months of light use, and will not go away.  Don't waste your money on this slow piece of junk.  Media streaming painfully slow and choppy.
Like its simplicity, and high resolution screen. Prefer more and easier off-line storage rather than using online storage as default.
light weight and great screen for the money. Similar to MAC APPLE for half price. No DVD player so not for you if that is a need.
Still working out how to fully use the chrome system.The chrome book itself is a great piece of equipment and very easy to use.
This is by far the best Chromebook in the market, So if you're looking forward to get one. Give it a shot, you won't regret it.
It surpassed my expectations, the screen looks amazing plus the extra 100gb offered by Google makes it a really good deal
Alright so first I have to give an awesome shout out to Amazon Prime's flat $6.99 same day delivery fee... I ordered this computer around 9am and got it by 4pm right at my doorstep.  Love that.  I get the package, pretty simple, ready to use right out of the box.  I open the laptop up, it's half charged. Plug it in and go adventuring into the world of Chromebooks... since this is my first.<br/><br/>So I figure out a couple things right off the bat.  I'm an apple person, I've had MacBooks, iPhones, iPads, iPods.. and a couple of PCs that are in the electronic heaven in the sky. I quickly realized that this is just an tablet with a keyboard and mousepad... not a computer.  In terms of appeal, it has the feel of a MacBook Air... sleek, black keys, silver matte, the logos on the outside even look cool. But...You can't play Sims.  You can't play Second Life.  This thing just isn't powerful enough to process games or anything like that.  I tried playing a couple games on Facebooks app section and it was steady going, not lightening fast- like I was hoping.  There has been some hang ups... and when I say that I mean, going to websites where I couldn't scroll down with the down arrow (weird), slow loading, the ever so depressing "chrome web store" and figuring out that it cannot run Java are a couple of negative experiences I've had so far.<br/><br/>Let's talk about this terrible thing called a "chrome web store".  If it's an "app", it's basically just a link to the website (ie. mint, gmail, spotify). That's it. And they are REALLY limited... and sometimes I really wonder who are making these apps, some are misspelled and none seem to have good reviews... I read article after article that said "Chromebook now can run android apps" sort of..... if the developer decides to integrate it. If I understand this correctly, you can only get some Android apps if you have a compatible Android device, which I do not. The more common apps that I know are on there but most haven't yet... hopefully that improves because I find myself longing for my trusty apple store apps on my iPad...<br/><br/>The 1080p I would say is worth the extra $... very nice display. Sound is ok, not the best. I also haven't had trouble with multitasking either... I'm watching netflix and browsing the internet at the same time... Can't do that with an iPad!<br/><br/>I'm thinking about going back  to school so this is an excellent school computer... but when this is one is on it's last legs, I'm going to go with something that runs Windows or Mac OS... so many more things are compatible with those operating systems... maybe that will change when Obama is gone...<br/><br/>I didn't give it a full five stars because of the expectations of the "chrome web store".  I thought since Google Play was related, we'd have a better more user friendly adaptation with way more choices.  But overall, this is a sturdy little trolling device.<br/><br/>p.s. The Obama comment was a joke... a misplaced joke.
Very nice, but not really worth the hundred dollars more than the comparable Asus 13" chromebook.
First Chromebook but I like it. Great screen, fast connection, decent battery life, very portable.
It is a great computer for the price. It does everything that you need for for the great price.
It has incredible resolution (1080) and a decent amount of battery time of about 7 hours, depending on activity. Overall it was ok, the only problem I had was finding the settings and not having many options to customize.<br/>It loos similar to a MacBook, but without the back lit keyboard and apple. Lightweight and easy to carry.
It was a very nice computer that came on time and very happy with it thank you Amazon.
Fantastic Computer, great for getting work done and helping you stay focused!!
Delivered on time...very nice computer...Easy to set up, including printing...
Great product, and it was shipped in a timely manner. I'm a very happy buyer.
Still need to get used to the Chrome OS, missing programs and online apps.
excelent chromebook, the screen its extremly crip its just a little slow
Ok
Works great after neglect annoying sound produced by the track pad.
Amazing screen and excellent battery life make this my favorite laptop.
Excellent laptop with the right price and very good operating system
Received my Chrome book, charged it up, turned it on, it would NOT connect to my WIFI.  I have a Samsung first gen Chromebook and am using the same WIFI for it. After spending an hour with customer support, their answer was that I need to reconfigure the computer BACK to factory settings.  Well I couldn't even log in to the computer, how could I have possibly changed the factory settings.  This piece of junk is going back.
The seller was great, the product seems flimsy but is working fine.
It arrived before the expected date. It works well per spec stated.
Out of the box review so far has me fairly happy with my purchase of this Toshiba CB35-B3340 13.3-Inch Chromebook 2.  The screen is bright and crisp, keyboard is solid though feels fragile.  Speakers are great.  This being my first Chromebook experience I was unaware of the touchpad not having a left/right button.  There is no manual included with the laptop so I had to search the web for a bit to find out how to use the right click function. My only other gripe is so far was trying to figure out how to activate the Google Drive storage offer of 1TB free.  There was no documentation about activation included.  Took a bit of time and searches to figure out how to get activate it.  The price is appealing for what it is.  Frustrating purchasing it from Amazon and finding it advertised the following day for $50 less since Amazon doesn't price match.
Sides scuff easily, screen is flimsy, and I feel like its not even powerful enough to watch full hd videos on youtube..  BUT it boots super fast,  very light and the screen is the best you can get on a chromebook for this price
Beautiful, practical, lightweight, efficient,tireless battery!
First one the screen went bonkers after a couple of weeks. Returned. Second one, after 3 months, screen won't load? Just died overnight???? Trying to determine warranty avail but amazin won't do squat after 30 days. My last purchase of Toashiba Or with Amazon, big conglomerate bezo f you
It's a good laptop, but even not a use into a month. The left side of the screen started to get bad pixels. Enough to make it really noticeable and hard to work with. Nonetheless, excellent product if this doesn't happen.
Just excellent! Fast enough and the screen is really perfect!
this device is a great performer and exceeds all expections
love it. Boots fast, good screen, good battery, easy to use
The screen broke after 6 months of use. Not physically.
Works great. Case plastic and painted. Scratches easily
Awesome computer for the money. Fast and easy to use.
I got this for my granddaughter and she loves it...
Product is just what we needed!  Like it very much.
Well built laptop, although the corners towards you when it's open are a little sharp, but it doesn't seem to be sharp enough to cut, or be uncomfortable for less than 30 seconds
Overall I'm very satisfied with the Chromebook except for one annoying issue. It has serious light bleed from the bottom of the screen which annoys me when watching movies
Speedy, cute, and so far does everything I need.
Very nice laptop works fast with great graphics.
This Chromebook has an incredible screen, great for photos.  But I found it bulky to use.  Programs and many apps I have been using not available on chromebook system.
Every thing I hoped for, works great. Pete M
I purchased this computer in May and have had nothing but problems. It would not work with my brand new Brother printer. It would not allow me to access documents from work and edit them. It was extremely slow after the first month or so. Now, 5 months later, it stopped working completely. The Chrome logo just flashes.  I took it to the computer repair person I have used for 15 years and he said there was nothing that could be done, there were no tools or protocols to repair these computers. It is going in the trash. Absolutely the worst computer I have ever purchased and of course, the warranty period ended in June. I am going back to a Windows operating system and buying another new computer. I am a very disappointed customer. What a waste of $300.<br/><br/>Note- Manufacturers comments below are nonsense. Just what they say to every negative review. I spent probably 12 hours total online with the help desk trying to get the printer to work with this computer. It would not work and there was nothing they could do about it. Based on comments from other unsatisfied users,  I am not wasting any more time online now that it won't even start up, only to be told the warranty does not apply to my issue. Save yourself the hassle and buy a different computer.<br/><br/>2nd Note- Manufacturer please explain how I am supposed to do a power wash when the computer won't turn on. More nonsense. You don't even read the review to understand the details of the problem. Just copy and paste the standard response.
This thing I'd too slow for general use. Giggle docs laggs even with the somewhat faster cpu. Plays video fine though, and the screen is great.
Great Chromebook, the best on the market.
Still figuring it out, but looks great.
Great product and I am very satisfied!
Excellent; exactly what my son wanted!
Amazing! Wish I had purchased earlier.
Very good product and fast shipping !
This chromebook has been crashing. It restarts itself over and over again.<br/>Nevertheless, everything is saved with google.
This chromebook needs a better processor. I've had it for a week and it has become very obvious that its under powered. If I'm streaming an HD video on YouTube or Netflix and open another tab to google something. The video will stutter and become choppy. It's choppy when visiting regular websites as well. If your only watching videos in full screen and not running anything else, the lag is noticeable but less annoying. When using the app drawer in the OS there is a small but very noticeable lag. The speakers are amazing for a laptop. They are very loud and full. Obviously your not going to get much bass from them but they are much fuller than I'd expect. They are not the usual trebled out laptop speakers. They sound very clear, loud and full. The display is very good as well. Its bright, vivid and accurate. Its an IPS display so it looks great at any angle. The display is 1080p but chromeOS is only optimized for 720p so basically everything is very small. Its almost funny toshiba shipped it like this. The icons, text cursor and anything else on the screen is super tiny. You can go into settings to change the display resolution down to something closer to 720p and everything will look normal. The overall build quality is great. Its light and very nice looking. Keyboard is very good as is the trackpad. RECAP! display is great minus the scaled OS looking tiny. The speakers are very impressive. The build quality is pleasing. Then there is the performance. I am returning it because of this issue. I love watching a video and browsing the web at the same time and this latptop can not handle that. The processor is just too weak.
works great! very happy great screen
I have always had a desk top and was not sure if i would like it or not.But i liked it so well i bought my wife one also.
great laptop! I really recomend it!!!
This laptop would be fine were it not for the key lag. Typing almost anything, even using Google Docs, you experience this kind of lag. This will drive you crazy if you intend to use it in a class to take notes or do any kind of work on. It's basically a Netflix machine and that's it. To give you an idea of its performance, my old Hp Chromebook 14 has absolutely no lag typing, ever. It's far snappier than the Toshiba.<br/><br/>This is probably because Toshiba decided to put more money into the 1080p screen and not invest in a strong enough processor. What's the point in a nice screen if the machine is frustratingly slow to use. Perhaps Toshiba will fix this issue in the Chromebook 3. You have to go into Chromebooks with realistic expectations: obviously they will not have the performance of a Macbook or $1000 PC but at the same time a Chromebook should at least be able to type and watch 1080p videos without stuttering.<br/><br/>Amazon was great and allowed me to return it. There are better laptops out there.
Great little youtube machine.
Speed and Display is fine ...
Purchased this for Christmas present for my son.  Out of the box on Christmas Day, would not connect to our wifi.  We have 2 other laptops, 2 tablets, and 3 smartphones that never have a problem connectiing, so new that this was not a router issue.  We worked with this for 2-3 hours and all of a sudden connected.  My son had 2 weeks of zero issues after.  Speed and resolution was great for this price of computer.  Then we experienced the same issue, would not connect to our wifi or anyone elses.  Had read about this issue from others, lack of adequate knowledge from Toshiba to correct.  Sounds like this happens with some units but not the majority.  Whats the point of a Chromebook if you can't connect reliably?  I would have given 5 stars had we had no wifi issues.  Did not want to devote/waste more time and energy into an inexpensive device and returned.  Will try our luck with another company, purchased the new ASUS C300 with 4GB, will see how it does.
Great experience all around.
STILL LEARNING HOW TO USE IT
Good delivered, thank you!
Love my new chromebook!!!
I was interested in learning about Chromebooks and I am very impressed with this Toshba Chromebook. It starts in 4 secs !! and surfing the net is really fast as well. Watching movies and U Tube clips on the beautiful screen are crystal clear, the Skullcandy speaker sound is also really good for a portable device and I find myself having to turn the volume down as it is quite loud at maximum volume, which is a welcome surprise. The only issue I have is that the defaylt font size is very small for my 67 year old eyes !! I have overcome this by setting the screen resolution to 150% and now I can read my Gmail E mails, goodle searches etc with no problem I would recommend this device as a great machine at a great price from Amazon delivered to me in mid July to Sydney Australia for the equvalent of AUD 400.
Quick and great graphics
Great and simple to use!
I would have given 5 stars if battery could last for 10hrs in stead of 8hrs.
very good for the price
Love it.. great choice.
ningI knew before hand that the operating system would be limited in regards to software, and that's just fine, as it performs with ease in all other aspects.  Aesthetically, the computer has a nice minimalist style, similar  to a mac book, though it does feel a bit flimsy and doesn't include a back lit keyboard.  Thus far, it runs extremely fast and smooth, boots up in a matter of seconds.<br/><br/>Now there are some issues I keep running into.  First off, this is my second chromebook, as the first one had hdmi issues.  I've had this new one for about a week or so and once again I'm having trouble hooking it up to tv's.  Also the touch pad tweaks out sometimes, randomly clicking.<br/><br/>If it weren't for those problems I'd recommend this product to anyone
I like the speed just wish it could hook up to a external  CD DVD drive
Better than expected!
If it only it would have done what it was supposed to do I would have loved it... But it could not stay connected to the internet.<br/>I tested the wifi connection on this computer versus my iphone 6. Range wise the iphone beat the toshiba by a lot. Speed wise the same. But not only that, the toshiba disconnected from the wifi constantly and then I had to reboot it. I thought it was a hardware problem so I went back to Best Buy and got a replacement. The replacement had the same issues plus a blurry camara. Im sure is a bad batch that best buy got given the super nice reviews. If it was not for the wifi connection problems I would really have loved it since is super light and the screen is awesome.
only had it for about a week, but so far it seems pretty amazing.
Super nice machine.
Get the HD version.
Nice easy to use !
After several months of using this product, I have mixed feelings. For a computer of this price, it has excellent speakers. That's always a plus. However, after a few weeks, some pinkish splotches appeared on various parts of the screen. They're only noticeable when the screen is displaying something dark, so it was never much of a concern to me. More recently, the computer's bottom component started to fall off and I'm unable to pop it back on. The construction on this computer is incredibly poor, and I intend to utilize my warranty in the future to get a (hopefully less flawed) replacement.
Pros:<br/>Absolutely fantastic screen. Second-to-none until you're in the upper-mid-grade of Windows laptops.<br/><br/>Quiet. Of course, because it's fanless. No noise at all.<br/><br/>Decent keyboard, though it could be a bit better - most of the qualms I have are just with the standard Chromebook keyboard design, though.<br/><br/>The speakers are actually pretty decent. Not great, by any means, but not bad at all, especially for the price point.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Slow. Laggy. I bought this laptop based off of people's reviews of the ARM-based Chromebooks, and how laggy they are. Everyone said to do a Celeron, instead. That's fine - just not this one. Despite the 4gb of RAM, this laptop is slow and laggy, to the point of frustration. I have typing lag when I type in the address bar (with only one or two other tabs open), pages are slow to render, etc. My Nexus 9 tablet can handle more simultaneous pages in Chrome, and it can render them much faster. It's inexcusable, really.<br/><br/>Plastic everywhere - Of course, it's dirt cheap, so it's to be expected, but it needs to be said. It feels like cheap plastic, not even the nice stuff. :)<br/><br/>The keyboard. Having to use a keyboard shortcut for home/end/delete/etc really sucks. It's no way to go through life.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought that this could tide me over for just a few weeks, until I moved, and built out a new Windows desktop. It turns out that the experience, overall, is so frustrating, I just can't manage it. I hate that it was so bad. I would gladly buy an Acer C720 to replace it, as my daughter has one and it performs great, but the screen on that laptop is absolutely horrible.<br/><br/>Overall, I think we need slightly better, slightly more expensive Chromebooks before they're ready for prime time (in my opinion), but at that point, you could get a halfway-decent Windows laptop, with infinitely more functionality... so, what's the point?
not what I needed
Excellent Product
I bought this device a few months back from BestBuy, and today one of the screws on the back of the device had come out. So being the techie that I am, I decided to get out my tool kit, and fully remove the backing of the device to see what was in it.<br/><br/>Major LIES!!!!!!<br/>The BATTERY IS SUPPOSED TO BE 4,400 mAh "MILIAMP HOURS" BUT IN REALITY IT IS 45WH AND 3860mAh!!!<br/>There is plenty of room in the case for a larger battery, but noooooooooo......<br/>Also Related to the battery, the charging system is rated for a max of 3A input, yet the AC adapter is rated for much lower! I'm also sure that the actual working output for it "the AC adapter" is much lower than that even!<br/>This device can barely multi-task, and gets super hot super easily!<br/>Also the thermal compound used is complete junk, and of very very low quality! The heat sink is merely a steel plate that is screwed onto the board! It should be copper or aluminum! I'm going to have to open back up the device, and re-do the thermal compound, get a more powerful AC adapter, also eventually get a better battery retro-fitted into it!<br/><br/>At least one thing though, the component brands are very good!<br/>Dual HF 2 watt, 4Ohm 1.5 inch speakers in tuned cases, Samsung branded RAM chips, The Intel processor is legitimate.<br/>A concern was that ALL the screws were loose!<br/>Also the wiring of the radio antennas was done wrong! The WIFI and Bluetooth antenna cables were both un-shielded plain cheap wire, and twisted together! Now I'm getting better range for my home wifi since I untwisted and separated the wires!<br/>Also the device case is extremely thin and cheap plastic!<br/>If you buy this device, get a very good case for it!
Great
Value for money!
This kicks butt!
Got one for my college student son...he loves it!
Amazing product. Chrome book itself is lame but when you use crouton it becomes perfect one with all bells and whistles. Ofcourse good specs with IPS
good chromebook
Everything OK!
excellent
Excellent
My biggest issue, it is a little on the flexible side.  The case is not very rigid and neither is the screen.  Also, the screen gets some random artifacts on it every once in a while...cannot really figure out the issue but if I close the screen or reboot it, they go away.
Everything I hoped it would be, but the battery life sucked BIG TIME! 9 hours...NO WAY! The best battery reading I ever got, after running battery to zero and charging to 100%, was 5.53 hours. I returned the Chromebook because of that.  That was a deal breaker. Too bad.
Excellent for web surfing. I couldn't connect my WIFI printer. The instructions were almost non existent. Once I overcame these barriers I am still sold on this Chromebook because my PC has become infected with a virus that no antivirus software will get rid of.
Awesome!
Was solid for a while but the screen completely busted after 3 months, requested Warranty but Toshiba said they wouldn't cover it.  Not worth fighting over a cheap computer, buy at your own risk.
While I'm impressed with the 1080p resolution and the similar size, keyboard, and mouse to the MacBook Air it really is a cheaper version of just that.  It feels cheap.  When I type on the keyboard it makes a clearly audible rattling sound.  The laptop has a chrome color but feels plastic and flimsy.  The keys look just like a MacBook keyboard but feel more plastic and less durable.  You can tell that Toshiba tried to mimic a MacBook air here and did a good job at copying them for a third of the price.  But it's blatantly obvious that your getting a computer for a third of the quality.  Returning this soon, going to go with an over priced MacBook.
Perfect
We purchased this chromebook as a Christmas gift for our daughter to use at school.  She had her first issue with it a day or so after opening it, the sound would stop after playing a few songs.  The song was still playing, but no sound.  In order to get sound again they machine had to be turned off and on again.  Annoying, especially given that sound is one of the selling points.<br/><br/>Our daughter is very carefeul and particular with her things, never had any issues with any of the other electronics she owns, including several Apple products she carries daily.  Yesterday she opened the Chromebook to find a large black band extending 2/3 of the way across the screen horizontally and a smaller line running down vertically.  Took it in today to the retailer it was purchased from and were told the screen was cracked.  The machine had never been dropped, but we were told perhaps she'd pinched the screen too hard opening the lid.  We were told that Toshiba would not warranty the repair, even though the machine had been in use for a total of 4 weeks.<br/><br/>Very disappointed with the quality of the unit.
I've had this for about nine months, and I really wanted to like it. This is probably a good computer for someone who needs something extremely simple and light, but also has no intention of taking it anywhere. So, no one. This just goes to show that no matter how much research you do, you can still get a dud.<br/><br/>It runs okay. Videos stutter at anything over 480p, and trying 1080 is never worth it, so paying more for a better screen is just a waste. If you have more than five tabs open, it can crash. The audio likes to randomly cut out or sound like a robot.<br/><br/>The battery is supposed to be eight hours or something, but it's really 4.5 to 5. Pretty bad for a Chromebook.<br/><br/>While it is really light, it is built so badly I think my 11-year-old sister could do better. It either shipped without a screw or the screws were too loose, because now the underside of the case is coming off and there's no way to fix it. I even found a new screw that should have fit, but the damage is done and the laptop looks/feels just awful. I can see the inside of the laptop through the hole. There's also a slight bend in the case in general, meaning it doesn't completely close shut, leaves about a 2mm space in-between. Also, the keys like to stick, especially the 'u' key on mine, and I have to press it really hard to make it stop. The hardware is so absolutely terrible, Toshiba should be ashamed. I've had it for nine months, and I want to trash it.<br/><br/>Don't buy this. Not even if you're like me and you're a desperate college student. It's not worth it. You won't be able to properly run most of the programs you need for class anyway. It's a money sink and you're much, much better off saving up for something in a slightly higher price range. I feel like I picked up a clunker at a garage sale, not paid full price for a brand-new laptop from Amazon. Don't do it. You deserve better.
I bought this as a Christmas present for my son, who lives in another state.  After about two weeks the screen went blank.  He has been trying to get Toshiba to fix or replace it, but is getting a complete runaround. They finally said they would take a look at it, but no guarantee they could fix it and they won't replace it.  Btw, they want $40 to do this.  Bottom line, I will never purchase another Toshiba product again.
Ottimo
I've used an Acer 710 Chromebook for 1.5 years, just about every day for 1-2 hours.  A few months ago it started "crashing", and since I got a gift card used it towards a TCB2 last month.<br/>After using the TCB2 for a few days I thought it should get 5 stars.<br/>After a week, 4 stars.<br/>Now after 3 weeks I feel like I'm being a bit generous with 3 stars.<br/>Yes the display is quite nice.  Except that there is one distinct area of "light bleed" on the lower edge.<br/>The trackpad works a bit better than the Acer, however when opening up a window to chose photos the new window slowly scrolls, even without touching the pad.  After ~5 seconds it stops, but it's a pain to have to wait to chose a photo/file.<br/><br/>I understand that it's always a trade off between battery life, cost, size and heat but the processer speed is BARELY acceptable. Running more than 3 or 4  browser tabs will slow things down noticeably.<br/>Don't know if it's related to the processor (likely more the graphics power) but mine will not smoothly play 1080p Youtube videos.  The picture and sound "stutter" every 3-5 seconds.  Plays fine in 720p, but shame you can't use the full capability of the display.<br/><br/>The display/lid is also quite tight, and you have to basically wedge a fingernail in the tight crevice to open it up.<br/><br/>For the ~$200 I paid plus the gift card I'll keep it, if only for watching Amazon Prime in bed at night.<br/>Will just deal with the slow processor and other annoying "little things".
It just arrived yesterday and I don't give a damn how great the screen res is or or how lightning fast it's supposed to do something - if I can't even use the keyboard comfortably, then it's going back.  The edge of the deck is so sharp that I actually have a painful red mark on the heel of my hand after 30 minutes of surfing.  Maybe if you're only using it to watch movies, etc. - then you'd be fine.  But this is so poorly designed even Toshiba tech support agent said a lot of people complain of this issue.
Screen is really nice. Battery life/build okay. If you use a lot of Google products you'll be fine. If you have high demands, buy a real computer with more power (Windows or Mac).
Great
I received the chromebook today. The computer was just thrown in the package with no packing. At first glance the computer looked promising. Within five minutes of using it, two keys on the keyboard got stuck. Looks like I'm sending it back already. I'm very disappointed.
Other than the HD screen and the weight, this machine is useless. (Well, not entirely but you get the jist)<br/><br/>The anti-fingerprint coating scratches very easily, so much so that I don't even know how I've done it. The bottom right corner makes a popping noise like it's not secure when I use it. There's no scrolling motion with the mouse, and google docs won't open some documents.
Very nice device with a good screen. Slim, light and portable. Only negative aspects are build quality and cheap looking external covers.
love it !!!!
Love
Will return. Would like this very much, but the tiny font on adress bar and tabs is a deal breaker.  The only day to make the address bar readable is to lower screen Res...then you get bad looking display. Dissatisfied.
I love it. A few minor issues 1) some white screen bleed at the bottom 2) lid does not fit flat to base 3) ac power light is not working.<br/>Thought about returning it for a replacement but not worth the hassle. None of the issues are a deal breaker. It's plenty fast for what I do and the screen is "awesome".
Even when enlarged print was still too small for person it was meant for but speakers are awsome great screen
it's a fine chromebook, nice size, and the screen is sharp.  2 issues, the 'skullcandy' audio is horrible- even by mobile device standards, and the fact they advertise skullcandy it just makes it seem all the less.  2 issue, this baby gets HOT,  I kid not when I say an egg could be cooked on this thing.  It has no moving harddrive, i don't think at least... but 4gigs of ram is a bit much to not have a fan.  I do not use this on my lap.  It's so bad one of the screws on the case popped out, I stopped trying to replace the screw as it kept popping out.  For $350ish I expect all screws to stay in place, halfway decent audio (at least no skipping/static), and something that won't burn/melt me or my table
So smothie, nice and quality screen, good touchpad, nice sound, speedy, awesome design,  9/10.
screen broke in 1 week
Bought one at BB. I used it for a few days and returned it. I typically open a dozen tabs or more and it was severely bogged down. Processing lag was terrible (e.g. switching between tabs).<br/><br/>1080p doesn't scale well on a 13" screen. Not on Chrome OS at least. Makes it very hard to read native sized icons.<br/><br/>The screen IS crisp. But the overall build is quality is mediocre. It won't fall apart in 2 while typing but it's not very sturdy feeling..<br/><br/>At $300-330 I would pass. This would be a decent deal for about 220 or less.
Screen is a bit flimsy and the mouse pad is lose when you tap it it moves.
I purchased this Chromebook for my daughter for use with her schoolwork.  It works nicely for that since Google Docs is the standard the school uses.  I reviewed many options before I pre-ordered this unit.  This does everything my daughter needs nicely.  I received the unit on November 3, 2014 and have since seen price drops.  Two reasons why I give this only 3 stars.<br/>1 - Quality/durability.  The case feels very plastic and cheap.  Within the first 30 days, a hinge broke.<br/>2 - Toshiba Warranty/Support -- This carries a one year warranty.  However, good luck getting a hinge repaired under warranty.  After four attempts with the Toshiba phone tree, I finally got someone that dealt with Chromebooks.  At that point, I was told not to send into the Toshiba repair depot but take it to a local repair.  Remond, WA was the closest to Portland, OR.  I called them and they do not take shipped in repairs and they also mentioned that they are not authorized to work on Toshiba warranty repairs.  When I asked for a ballpark for the repair, with parts, labor and shipping, I might as well buy another unit.
So far so good. Battery life isn't as long as expected.
Went on sale $20 cheaper the day it arrived at my door
Perfect for me.  Guess I'm a Chromie.  Great machine!
Alhamdulillah very good laptop. Loving it bruh.
First time I used and ENTER KEY doesn't work!
Awesome second laptop with very good display
Although the sound is excellent and videos look great for the size of this computer, I cannot get past the teeny tiny GUI of Chrome. Of course I can enlarge text content but I can't find a way to make the Chrome interface - the section with bookmarks and the address bar - large enough to see. I suppose if you're 18 with 20/20 vision there is no problem but for this older person with bad vision I find myself with a headache and blurry vision from spending the day trying to find a way to make the interface larger.  I found a couple of fixes recommended by others but they didn't work for me, and so for that reason alone the book is going back to Amazon.<br/><br/>I also find the touch pad annoying as it has a rather grainy feel to it and when right/left clicking the touch pad feels very flimsy like it will not last for long at all. I said the sound is excellent above, and it is, but the volume will not go very high and so if I place the Chromebook about three feet away it is hard to hear even with the volume turned all the way up. However, I am an older person and we all know what that's like. Maybe in another 4-5 years when there is an over abundance of baby boomers, companies like Google will start paying attention to this market.
Love it. Didnt need all that fanciest.
Fast and easy to set up. Good buy.
Screen is incredible...Love it!
great item for what it is
Not perfect but its ok
Fast, beautiful, feel good.<br/>I'm so excited.
i now have 2 of them
I use it everyday.
Purchased from Best Buy. I really wanted a chromebook and after killing my Mac Book Air with coffee wanted a replacement that would not cost the earth to replace the next time I kill it.<br/><br/>I am doing a masters in accounting and needed it for school.<br/><br/>Its a great machine did almost all I wanted but ended up returning it for 2 reasons. First I read my text books online and Amazon Cloud Read can not open my required Tax law Text online, it only opens in the Windows or Mac app. And Second the keyboard was sub par, the letters are a light grey font on a black key, I found this really irritating compared to the back light on the Mac Book Air. Now I knew this when I bought it but in the end could not live with it.<br/><br/>A few things I would have liked to have known before I bought one. The shell is not smooth it has a rough texture. Opening the lid is hard as there is no where to grip it. The track pad is not smooth it to has a texture which I did not like.<br/><br/>In terms of speed and spec its great.<br/><br/>To improve add a touch screen and a back light on the key board and it would rival the pixel.
very good labrop
Very satisfied.
Works great!
Easy to use.
I love it!!
Pros: Great for online entertainment specially when using it along a Chromecast stick! It is fast and has a great set of speakers. Screen is bright and rich in colors. Great value for your money.<br/><br/>Cons: Small hard drive and crappy charger (heats up and the cord contains traces of LEAD).
Love it!!!
Good stuff
I returned the Chromebook.Was not what I wanted.
Over all pretty good!
I went through two of these. I thought the first one was defective. But both had the same issues. They were both slow to load pages, I did not have lots of tabs open either. The real problem i had is that they could not play 1080p videos. All 1080 videos stuttered and paused. The screen looks fabulous which is why i returned the first one and tried again. I liked the keyboard, mousepad, screen and i like chromebooks. I wanted to like this Chromebook, but not being able to watch HD videos on the beautiful 1080 screen was a deal breaker.
very nice
This was a gift for my wife and thus far it's been a hit. Monitor seems sharper than other chromebooks I've seen. Quick response. We haven't used the google apps much so haven't fully investigated all of it's capabilities yet.
Perfect.
Amazing!
the laptop lacks a screw in the back!
Its o.k. because its takes so much getting the 'defining features to work' its not worth the hassle. The updates can be annoying but it is fast. Its does do a fair amount off-line and I got 1TB for Google Drive after the purchase, that came with the laptop. Decent machine, I use it 95% if the time over my other machines because its lighter, quicker and I know everything is backed up in Google Drive or Dropbox.
Love it
This product does not work if you wish to chat via Google Chat.  The camera mics start to get scratchy and there is a tremendous echo.  I have replaced this item twice with the same results.  A search of the Toshiba data base yielded a known issue that does not have a fix.  Very disappointed that this highly rated product has this serious defect.
Buy it
hard to use, keyboard is small and doesn't have some function keys, like a delete key.  Not using it anymore, replaced it with a Lenovo, and am loving it.
Loved the chromebook but it's not for me as of yet. If they ever have the ability to run full programs, I will definitely get another one!
great
The display is gorgeous, the rest of the package is lackluster.  What's so hard about having a great screen and great build quality?  I understand that you have to meet certain price points, but case flex and cheap feeling materials really don't help.
Could not connect to brother printer
This Toshiba 13.3 in. Chromebook 2 has a BEAUTIFUL full HD display - BUT - after a couple of days testing, it was obvious that the Chrome OS is not at all well suited to the needs of a photographer. It's difficult to transfer photo files from the camera to the computer, the photo editing software is primitive compared to Photoshop Elements and, in any case, can not be used on the small screen - an external monitor is essential. The inability to directly print (cloud printing is required) is a deal breaker. In addition, the unit I received would not synch Bluetooth with my mouse or Vizio sound bar. Also, the headphone output would not drive my Sennheiser headphones. This Chromebook is surprisingly fast and is well suited to viewing info on-line, streaming Netflix, etc. The keys are pleasant to type on. If Google expects the Chrome OS to go heads on with Windows or Apple, Google has work to do.<br/><br/>AMENDED REVIEW - After using this little beauty for a week, I have to give it 5 stars. It's about 70% of a MacAir for about 30% of the cost. Once I became familiar with cloud computing, I discovered that I liked it. Photographic work was very easy using Google+. As long as you are working with JPEG images on this computer coupled with Google+ in the cloud, it's very easy to download, sort and edit photos, and to then compile albums to share with others. Cloud computing leaves all the heavy work with complex programs to the big computer in the sky. Thus, you only have to buy an inexpensive computer like this to get your work done. Just be sure you have a high speed wi-fi connection. The apartment building where we live only supplies 10 Mbs Internet. This is adequate for photographic work, but faster would be better.
Not awesome. Cheap, yes. But sllloooowwwwww and with a wonky trackpad; very average screen clarity. I feel ripped off-- and the bonus is, I missed the window to return it by 2 days. Yay.
great !
The font is way too small. And yes you can make it larger by lessening the resolution. But then why why pay the extra cash for the hi-res screen? Otherwise it would have been 5 stars.
Too much lags
Arrived with circular dent in top cover. Would like to swap it but I really need to use it. It looks like a manufacturing defect,  as no damage visible on packaging.
I'm still checking out the Chromebook system.  It has some shortcomings from my point of view.  I still don't fully trust "the cloud" to keep all my stuff.
Expected too much. It's Limited. No port for cd. Unable to synk printer. Small!
The screen gets me everytime. It's awesome. I'm a Macbook Pro user and I think I Toshiba TN panel screen is on par with Apple's retina screen. It's crazy. But there has to be some trade-offs at such price point. It's the performance. The performance is not terrible by any means but it isnt the best. When you visit content intensive websites (or even large presentation on Google Slides) and have many tabs open with YouTube/Google Music playing in the background there's a noticeable choppiness.<br/><br/>By the way, this thing plays flash ! That's awesome too.
Works well a little clunky, but can't be beat for the price.
I have bought 3 pieces.<br/>The microphone does not work properly on any of them.  It cannot be used with Google Hangout (a Google App product supposed to be used with Chromebooks). The microphone makes a lot of noise when it is used. Moreover when you use an external mic (as a workaround) same problem persist.<br/>--<br/>It is clearly a hardware defect, since it appears on all three products.
I buy them for my grandchildren and they seem to enjoy it
Haven't had a chance to use it much but so far very good
The hardware is alright. Chrome OS is descent, but the keyboard has some lag. And BTW, you can't remove Chrome OS and install a real Linux distro. The display is beautiful!
Doesn't interface with many programs on websites
I wanted to be really happy with this Chromebook, and there are many good things to say about it.  But I had two problems with it, and as a result I'm returning it for a refund.  First, the trackpad is misaligned.  It's noticeably indented on the left side, but on the right side it's nearly flush with the front of the unit.  I use 'tap' to click, so I have a light footprint on the trackpad; but still, the misalignment has caused uneven gaps -- some of which are accumulating debris particles.  This can't be a good thing in terms of the Chromebook's longevity.  Also, clicking on the right side is more difficult because of the misalignment.  Second, there are some wifi connectivity issues which I don't have with my other devices on the same network.  My phone, kindle and Macbook pro all remain connected when the Chromebook frequently disconnects.  I wanted to use the Chromebook primarily to stream, and often when I pre-load a film (to avoid buffering), the stream is lost when I return to the tab.  The Chromebook has 8GB of RAM, and I don't have more than 5-6 tabs open at a time; so I'm not sure why the disconnection occurs.
Power cord broke first use--Contacted seller and have no t gotten a response.
I have wanted to get a Chromebook for a while now, but since my Windows laptop was working fine, I didn't think I could justify a new device. In the past couple months, I became very annoyed with the battery life of my Windows laptop and the weight (more than 5 pounds). I also became less enamored with my Nexus 7 (and tablets in general) and decided that I wanted to see if a lighter Chromebook could serve my casual surfing needs better. With the release of the Chromebook Pixel 2, I decided to jump in. It's worth noting that I had already moved all my files to Google Drive years ago and have had no problems adjusting to the limitations of a Chromebook.<br/><br/>When I received the $1,000 Pixel, I was immediately quite pleased. It had a great screen, great battery life, and a great track-pad. However, after a couple days I noticed that the WiFi was slow after I woke it from sleep (verified by speed tests). If I disconnected and reconnected, it would go back to normal. This was 100% reproducib... Read more
Ok maybe one star is a little harsh, but the limited screen tilt is very annoying. If you like to use this Chromebook on your lap, it is likely that you'll find the screen does not tilt back far enough for optimum angle.
Works perfectly as advertised!
chromebooks are on the come up
Nice , but had to return it.
Great and affordable laptop!
Great for my 12 year old's school work
Just got my Toshiba and everything seems pretty good, screen, keyboard, touch pad are all excellent, except for a green vertical line an inch in from the left side.  It's there all the time??
Highly recommend
Great laptop!
Good quality.
Goodddddd.
Very light and easy to use. I liked that I was able to set it up immediately. I just didn't consider some of my needs, and this didn't meet them, so I had to send it back.
Very difficult if your a PC or laptop user. Keys are very difficult to adjust to. Not sure I would purchase a Chromebook again. This is great if you only want to surf the Internet. Do not use for any work related things. This Toshiba is fast and screen is great.
Great
Great
absolutely slow as a snail.  Can't do anything including email in less than 2 minutes.  piece of s*** don't buy it!
It works ok, it's pity that I can't work on Microsoft Office...even though I knew it was when I purchased...
Only thing you cant Skype !!! You have to use something else :((
Im so glad i returned my windows labtop an got this love it!
Fabulous  wuick and easy ! Awesome size and design!
wonderful chromebook.
I think it was used.
Im used to using a tower PC most of the time, was hoping for something great, but was disappointed. It doesnt have any F keys.... I have a hard time trying to navigate through websites, it may be just that i didnt take the time to learn how to use it properly, but im not going to spend alot of time trying to learn something ive been doing forever with no problems.  Its just not user friendly at all, for me. but i still use it.
the system runnng speed is too low.
The Toshiba Chromebook 2 HD is a fine product itself. 5 Stars to Toshiba and 1 Star to Google OS. My reason for the 1 star is very simple, I purchased this model with a HD screen only to find out that Netflix, Vudu and other streaming sources are unable to playback in High Definition on this HD Chromebook 2. Why you ask? Apparently, Google is unwilling to pay the licensing fees to Netflix, Vudu and others for their Operating System to play HD. So, even though the consumer is paying fees to have Netflix, Vudu and the like, we are not able to receive a HD quality picture because of Google-Chrome OS.<br/>GOOGLE, the amazingly profitable and extremely high priced stock company is unwilling to provide the consumer with the basic things Apple and Microsoft include as standard with their products! Given the limited functions of the Chrome OS, HD streaming was one of the main reasons to own this Chromebook!<br/>THANKS GOOGLE FOR RIPPING OFF THOSE OF US ADVENTUROUS ENOUGH TO EMBRACE YOUR NEW OPERATING SYSTEM !!!!!!
It appears google just isn't there yet, the chrome book cannot receive the scanned documents. I've tried every way to scan a document on my printer and download it to my chrome book but it just can't be done.
Would have given this product a higher score however when I plugged it into a tv via HDMI it was difficult to adjust.  I would recommend something else for those who would use this for big screen viewing.
Thanks
I don't really like the chromebook. I really miss my HP.. this laptop was voted as the 4th or 5th best laptop of 2015.. I'm not impressed
It's too expensive for what you get. I ordered a cheaper chromebook after this one, and it worked just as well.
Freezes everytime i use it. Cant use it for more than 15 Minutes
Great value for the money
This thing is not worth the money I paid. About 1 month in, the screws in the bottom started to fall out and the screws connecting the hinge inside backed out also. I had to find a spare set of screws on eBay to repair this. NOW, less than 1 year, the screen went dead. Ugh. This thing suck! Don't waste your money look else where.
I returned it
Dont buy this.  Cant add printer, does not save photos, only good to read email and surf web.. hate it... already bought a Toshiba and wish I had not wasted my money on this... wish I could return it.
Good screen.  Underpowered.
slow as hell
First of all, Chromebooks in general, as I have now learned, are devices with very little functional capability. No Windows, so no typical computer functions such as printing, etc. You can access the internet and your email website. The salesboy mentioned that I could access multiple very useful apps, on the internet and a storage system called the 'cloud'. Perhaps, after I obtain an advanced degree from MIT, I might be able to make an attempt at one. If you just want an additional device for internet access and email, within your wi-fi zone then a Chromebook may meet your needs. But, if you need something more functional and flexible, get a good smart-phone or a real laptop computer, with the basic packages.<br/>As far as this Toshiba device is concerned, yes, it does have very good resolution and does what it's supposed to do relatively well. But, the list of negatives is too long for me to recommend this device. The default font was INCREDIBLY small and therefore every screen needed to be manually zoomed to at least 150% to be able to read anything. The touchpad (I call the stationary mouse) is a total pain in the a-- to use. Sometimes a normal 'click' works, sometimes a smack with a hammer is needed and sometimes a fly flying by completes a click.<br/>At this time, I would recommend a laptop computer instead of a Chromebook.
good !
PROS: This computer is nice... I guess. It is sleek and slinder, fast and the fact that it is connected to your email is awesome! It's simple and easy to navigate once you get the hang of it.<br/>CONS: You cannot download new browsers because they only want you to have chrome which sucks when you're trying to download something that can only work on certain browsers. Also, you can't download Java, Skype, along with many other things. The webcam has very poor quality.<br/><br/>I only recommend this computer to people who only need it for light use, such as googling or doing school work.
Made cheap
Good as long as there is Wi-Fi
battery life is dissapointing
Nothing wrong with the chrome-book, just not my thing.<br/>to small,and keyboard hard to navigate for me personally.<br/>It sits in the corner while I type this review on my old 15"<br/>Toshiba satellite Laptop
First let me say that I am a big fan of the chromebook.<br/><br/>I previously owned the HP 11.6 which had an amazing screen but was just way to slow<br/><br/>When I saw these reviews on the Toshibia I thought this would be an amazing purchase<br/><br/>However, I have a few quibbles with the product, while the screen is good it;s nothing to write home about compared to the HP .<br/><br/>The computer it self feels cheap especially the plastic.<br/><br/>As for the speakers nothing exciting considering Skull Candy was involved.<br/><br/>The computer is very fast for a Chromebook, but that;s about it.<br/><br/>Thinking of returning it and buying an HP stream
Not happy  with many things. Example  - can't have Skype full version  and Free
I can't use windows s*** on here and UNBUNTO blows.
This is a great unit if you don't need a fully functional word processor.  Even with the Word App, and Google Docs, we couldn't do all we needed to when writing documents.  If you are simply going to surf, watch videos, Facebook, etc. Then you can't go wrong with this Chromebook 2.  We were sad to send this laptop back , but it just didn't have the word processing functionality we needed.
It works great and the screen resolution is good, but it doesn't have windows. Without windows there are a lot of things yo can't download, including skype.
Over glorified web browser
Has no caps lock, no cd drive, can't connect to hp printers and had to buy windows for it...
This is the first time I've ever written a review. I hate this product so much that I have to tell everyone. Please, do yourself a favor and just get a tablet. This thing is a tablet with a keyboard. If you need something for school or work, don't get this. If you just want to watch porn all day, sure this is perfect for you. Every moment I've used this thing made me the worst version of myself. I want to tie rocks to this thing and watch it slowly sink in the ocean where it belongs.
I am disappointed.  I bought two Toshiba Chrome Books to give as graduation gifts.  I made a big mistake.  Because I am told that you cannot install Microsoft Office Products on the hard drive like word, excel, etc., and further I am advised that you can only use these products with WIFI or an internet connection.  Please tell me I am wrong about this information. This is a disaster for me.<br/><br/>Deborah
Not on windows OS
This is chrombook.  Chromebook is NOT a PC.  You cannot put Windows on it.  On this particular one you cannot even put Linux (using legacy boot or Chrubuntu).  It is only good for browsing, nothing more.<br/><br/>It is also missing a lot of keys on the keyboard.  For example, there is no PageUp, PageDown, Home, End, Insert, Delete ...  The missing Home, End and Delete keys are a big disadvantage, in particular when you edit text.<br/><br/>I find nothing good in this chromebook but the display.  I should have bought a real laptop, or at least the windows one, so I could have a bigger variety of software.
I'm pretty disgusted with the fact that I cannot right-click on anything and cannot get into any of the computer settings (to set up hardware, security settings, etc.) I cannot save anything to the hard drive....it's all saved to a google drive. Can't save anything to the desktop. Cannot change add-ons, etc. I will be returning this computer for a regular PC.  BTW....there is no DELETE button anywhere on this computer! I'm very computer savvy and can write HTML code as well as experience programming/building over 100 websites. This computer is for those who know nothing and have no intention of using it for anything other than facebook and emails.
I like the idea of a Chromebook and I am sure this is a good one but IT DOESN'T HAVE A DELETE KEY!  One of the reasons I choose a laptop over a tablet is to have a full-featured keyboard.  That includes a delete key.
Computer was great shape but it was not what I was looking for.
Great laptop overall. Sound quality for this little thing is amazing. Screen is beautiful. I have been using since sept 2014. But have ran into a problem. My trackpad has stopped working entirely. It was fidgety over the past couple months but wasn't too bad. Now it just doesn't work and is not detected after a power wash. Sent it in last week. Hope they don't try to screw me over.<br/><br/>UPDATE* got it back in a box and was not securely placed. Also about a week and a half later the touch pad stopped working again. Their sending me a complimentary box this time. (Yay me, had to pay for shipping before).<br/><br/>Update 5/11/15:::<br/>Got it back last Friday may 8. After shipping it on March 20. Comes back with two of the rubber stands missing that hold the laptop off the table. Call support minutes after finding it. They told me I had to send it back in so they can replace them. Another 7-10 days. Support is a joke. I'd rather have them missing than waste my time. Would not recommend buying any toshiba products. If something goes wrong with it, chances are you're out of luck.
In a nutshell, my experience with this Chromebook running Chrome OS is like going through a job interview, I being an employer interviewing a job candidate. The Chromebook showed up, pretty, feisty, nimble, dared to be different yet properly dressed and socially likable. But she lacked the very basic job skills for the work, and was unreliable. At the end, I couldn't hire her. And her friends were very upset about it.<br/><br/>Let me make this clear: I did NOT rate this one star because I was surprised to find out Chromebook different from a Windows PC.  Please don't automatically assume that others are less knowledgeable than you are without even finishing reading. Read what I wrote then conclude, or don't read it at all.<br/><br/>I bought it knowing that the Chrome OS was in itself not a replacement of a PC for productivity. I bought it because I thought I could use it as a network computer (which Chromebook claims to be one) and connect it to the company's virtual machines equipped for productivity. That way, just the great screen of this Chromebook would be worth the $300.  I gave it one star because it simply could not do such a very basic thing which is absolutely essential for a network computer.<br/><br/>Yes, it is more about the Chrome OS than the hardware. But it's about a computer as a whole product, and the manufacturer chose the operating system for the computer, didn't it?  If a car manufacturer makes a car using a third-party engine which won't start in cold weather, are Alaskans supposed to still rate the car highly just because it has an attractive body? Unless Amazon has a rating system that breaks down into components, I know of no better way to rate this product. I am an end-user, and I just tell others how I feel about a product, and how the product performs in the view of an end-user. It's not my responsibility to sort out things like who is responsible for what. That's not my job.  I simply write what I experience.<br/><br/>THE REPORT OF MY EXPERIENCE:<br/><br/>Hardware: exceptionally good considering how inexpensive this is.<br/>The OS:  useless (for productivity purpose, see below).<br/><br/>The screen is remarkable. High quality IPS, which you don't find on most much more expensive midrange Windows laptops (under $1000). In fact, some of the higher end Windows PC laptops costing above $1000 don't have such a high quality screen.<br/><br/>But unfortunately, that's about the only thing that's really positive about this thing. To the end, it is unusable for any serious work. If you are only doing browsing and entertainment, plus occasional editing work, this would be fine, but to use it as a work computer for productivity, absolutely not.<br/><br/>I actually bought it knowing that the Chrome OS is in itself not a replacement of a Windows computer for productivity, so I am not complaining that a $300 laptop does not have the functionalities of a $1000 one. But I was thinking I could connect it through VPN to a virtual machine which runs Windows and is equipped for productivity. That way, just the great screen of this Chromebook would be worth the $300.<br/><br/>And it shouldn't be too much to ask for some very basic network connectivity on the Chromebook, especially considering that Chromebook is a network computer. So I thought.<br/><br/>Sadly, after hours, I could not connect this thing to the virtual machine through our Windows 2012 R2 server. I consider myself very knowledgeable in these matters, and I don't like to brag about it. But the sad truth is that Chrome OS is not functional for workplace VPN.<br/><br/>First of all, it wasn't immediately clear where to even find the place to set up VPN. Searching the Chrome Store for VPN yielded some weird and irrelevant stuff. There are some public VPN services, but that's for privacy "hiding" purposes, not for secure workplace network connection.<br/><br/>But it's there, and I found it. After I finally figured it out, it was headache upon headache. It lacks automatic VPN, and requires you to manually set up LT2P/IPsec authorization, either through a shared key or machine certification. It is already a hassle to go back to the server to set up and dig out the right authorization information. But what makes it really bad is that it simply does not work even after you have entered the correct information so many times and in so many different ways.<br/><br/>There is a remote desk (RDP) app that actually works, but that is for peer to peer connection only, and does not allow real manageable network connections to a server.<br/><br/>After hours of frustration, I packed it. This is going back to the store (by the way, I bought it at the local Best Buy for $329).<br/><br/>None of the Windows-based PCs I have used has this problem. With a Windows PC, once the server is set up, connecting a Windows client to the server through VPN is a matter of a few clicks. VPN with Windows is mostly automatic, and the only thing you need to enter in the first time is the username and password. Due to the OS uniformity, you can expect this to work even on a $200 Windows machine.<br/><br/>To the end, I regret to even have tried it. Not only is it not worth it for what it actually does, but more importantly it has wasted so much of my time for what it should be able to do but couldn't.<br/><br/>If you judge this thing by appearance, you would find it hard to believe this costs only $329. It looks and feels better than almost every other Windows-based laptop I checked at Best Buy. Judged by the high quality screens, 90% of the Windows-based PCs are automatically disqualified. Among the few that have comparable screens, they are either heavy, bulky, or ugly, or all of the three.  The only possible exception is probably the Lenovo Yoga Pro 2, which is over $1000.<br/><br/>But only if this thing would just do what a computer is supposed to do.<br/><br/>Overall, the Chrome OS is far from being ready. Even some very basic things haven't been thought through. For example, it is a hassle to change and set custom display font sizes. The default sizes are so tiny, those who have the best vision might even find it barely usable. But the OS is not very scalable in terms of font size. It's a mixed bag. Fonts would change here but not there, then but not now, etc. Overall feels bad.<br/><br/>Also, if you're used to the depth of the settings and controls of a Windows PC, the Chrome is just the opposite extreme. The OS really has very little for you to change and control.<br/><br/>Perhaps that's intentional for the sake of simplicity. Simplicity, that's good, but don't forget that a computer is a servant, and it is supposed to do what you want it to do for you. No one likes a servant that is so big on style, but so small in actual service.<br/><br/>Wait for five more years to see what Chrome is turning out to be.<br/><br/>PS:<br/><br/>I am a little bit amused to see so much "dislike" of my review. I know, I know, feelings have been hurt. I didn't mean to.<br/><br/>I actually wanted this to work. I bought it, didn't I? Brought it home and worked on it for hours. Yes, I am biased, but I am biased toward productivity, not toward any brand. And I don't like products that are not productive, regardless of how good-looking they may be.<br/><br/>If you like Chrome despite its shortcomings, including those I pointed out here, it's your freedom. In fact, if you like it for a right reason, you may be doing the right thing (as I said in the review, Chrome clearly is a great choice for certain type of users). But I have spoken about what I have learned from experiencing it, and I know I'm telling the truth. I rated it lowly not only because this thing is mostly useless to me, but also because it wasted me so much time due to its inability to do some basic things it (or anything that can be called a computer for that matter) ought to be able to do.<br/><br/>Toshiba made the best Chromebook, maybe, but it is nonetheless still useless to me. I put my review under this particular Toshiba Chromebook, not to compare it with other Chromebooks, but simply because it happens to be the one I purchased and experienced. Doing otherwise would be nonfactual.<br/><br/>I focused on the VPN and Remote Desktop connection, because that's where I had to start with (but could not go any further).  Without VPN and Remote Desktop connection of ability, I would have to be looking into the Chrome OS' own capabilities related to productivity. That would be an entirely different topic. And I know for a fact that the Chrome OS by itself does not offer anything close to what I need for productivity. I can list a few dozen major programs on Windows ecosystem that are indispensable to productivity, but Chrome OS either offers an inadequate solution or no solution at all.<br/><br/>Chrome OS's critical claim to credibility is that it's a network computer, which can be networked to take advantage of capabilities of other systems (for example, a Windows-based virtual machine in my own case). Without this capability, Chrome OS is simply not a serious consideration for a productivity-centric environment.<br/><br/>Many people argue that "look I can do this, and I can do that as well", but that's not the point. When it comes to productivity, it's all about efficiency and freedom from friction in an existing work environment. If you're not using the right tools with the right system, the loss of productivity will soon far surpass the upfront savings.
***READ CAREFULLY***<br/><br/>I just got done chatting with Toshiba about this product.  I was considering one each for both of my daughters.  If you think you are getting a regular laptop for cheap you are WRONG.  You will be getting what you paid for.  You cannot just install whatever you want on this.  Both of my daughters play Minecraft and I indicated that to the representative and they were like oooh yeah there's not Minecraft for the OS.  I'm like ok so I can't  just install it?  They're like no you can't just "install" games.  You can play games like on your phone though.  I'm like so I'm pretty much pinned to this Google system(enslaved).  Pretty much.  If you want freedom with your equipment do not get this product.
WOO HOO! First one up. OK here goes. I'll try and restrain myself now that I have everyone's attention. If I wasn't so disciplined I'd try a little of my stand up on y'all. First off, I'd like to say I had the Samsung 13" version of this baby and all in all it wasn't too bad until it started crashing on me and I sent it back. But now I have this one I'm writin on right now and I have to say "its nice". The deigns is really good.The Samsung could not fit a regular sized sd card. And the screen is much better. I mean its not as good as the MacBook Air that I want to get. But I'd keep this for the wifey... speaking of which or who by the way I noticed is putting on a few pounds and hey they all do, so me being a nice guy I says to myself "I'll do her a favor and buy her a couple of bellbars at the sporting goods store." A couple of 1lb.ers for toning. while I'm online why don't I just flip write over to Dicks.com? Save myself the trip right? Boy that store sure has changed, I wouldn't advise anybody going on that site. specially if your looking for sporting goods. On a brand new computer no less. When did they change that store? Anybody?....tough crowd...
