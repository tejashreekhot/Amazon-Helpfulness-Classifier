I came home this afternoon to that familiar brown box with the smiley on it, tore into it, and have been playing with my new phone ever since. I bought the 635 as a replacement until I'm eligible to upgrade again.<br/><br/>If you intend to use it is a GoPhone, or this is your first AT&T; device, it comes with a sim card and directions to set it up. If your current AT&T; phone already takes a mini sim, all you need to do is insert it in this phone. If you're like me and need a replacement, (but don't want to spend a small fortune on a new phone) then you can just slide in your old sim. My old sim card didn't fit, so I went over to the AT&T; store and they gave me one for no extra cost. To be clear, this works as a GoPhone or as a contract phone for existing plans.<br/><br/>When I renewed my contract with AT&T; late last year, I picked up the much lauded and excellent 41 megapixel Nokia Lumia 1020 (also a Windows Phone.) I had the phone 6 months before it was stolen, and unfortunately, I did not have insurance :( I loved that phone so much and it's the primary reason I chose to go with another Nokia Window's Phone. Since my phone was stolen, I've been using my ancient HTC Desire HD which has been acting really wonky the last week or so. Enter the Nokia Lumia 635. After much research on budget phones, going back and forth over whether or not i should upgrade to a high end phone via the next installment plan, I decided to go with this one for a few specific reasons: The 4G LTE, it's a brand I know and trust, and the price.<br/><br/>Coming from the 1020, this phone pales in comparison. However, for a $99 phone (and we should judge it for what it is), you couldn't ask for much more. I've owned and used iPhones, Window Phones, and Androids. I have a windows laptop, a Chromebook, and a Kindle HDX. I'm not committed to any one system and enjoy using them all. All have their advantages and disadvantages. I won't spend much time addressing those here, as I will assume that you've done your homework and are familiar with Windows OS. This phone does everything that Windows Phones can do, so I will focus instead on the pros and cons of this particular device.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>1. Speed and Memory<br/>Phone is fast and responsive. Switching apps, loading browsers, setting up email accounts was quick and easy. The phone is 4G LTE so there are no issues with speed here. This phone is just as fast as every high end phone I've ever used. I was able to transfer all of my contacts without incident (under 3 minutes for 594 contacts) using the bluetooth transfer data app. I've had issues before, and was weary of this process as I was coming from an Android. It was seamless and easy. I was able to easily link the email server to all of my accounts, my primary being Gmail. The phone has 8 GB of memory and comes preloaded with apps for Microsoft's OneDrive and the AT&T; Locker if you wish to store your data remotely or back it up. There is a slot for a micro sd to expand your memory up to 128GB.<br/><br/>2. Cortana<br/>The Personal Assistant "Cortana" (Microsoft's version of Siri) works very well and is a nice feature that I anticipate will be very useful. I wasn't aware this phone came with this feature which was a really nice surprise. She is able to locate and give directions to local businesses, search the internet, set reminders, make phone calls, and send texts quickly and accurately. It is a really excellent feature that works just as well (and imo, better) than Siri. At setup, Cortana gives you a survey to learn your interests and preferences for content. Based on your responses, she gives you live updates on the Cortana Title on your homescreen. (For example, one of the things I selected was to get live updates on headline news.)<br/><br/>3. Customization, Appearance, and Settings<br/>Phones are highly customizable. You can arrange the apps (tiles) you use the most on your homescreen wherever you want and can change the size of the tiles. You can also change the color theme of the tiles, and you can choose a background photo of your choice for your lockscreen. Security is limited a numerical pin; you don't have any options for fingerprints or alphabetical passwords. The settings menus and options for the phone itself and apps are impressive. You can set up your preferences for when to use data plan vs wifi, your battery life, and much more. You have a lot of control over what the phone does and when.<br/><br/>The phone itself is relatively light and Nokia sells interchangeable backings in a range of colors to personalize your phone. On this point, it is reminiscent to the colorful personalization of iPhone 5c. This isn't a feature I was too concerned with as I prefer to use a case for added protection. I think it is an attractive looking phone and I prefer the rounded edges to the square edges of previous models. The screen resolution is quite good and colors are bright and vivid. The quality was much better than I anticipated. The volume levels are good on videos, calls, and the ringer. My 1020 was stolen when I was on vacation in NYC so I bought a temporary flip phone at a Walgreens. The volume was SOOO poor and so low, so I was nervous about getting another budget phone but this is not an issue. The sound quality, on the other hand, isn't so great. (see more below)<br/><br/>4. Ease of Use<br/>The phone is very easy to use. If you use Windows 8 or 8.1 on your home computer, this phone should be relatively intuitive for you. The settings menus have a bit of a learning curve, but are relatively easy to manage and figure out by playing around with them. To customize your homescreen, move tiles, or change their size, you simply touch and hold down and then either drag where you want it or use the arrow to enlarge or shrink. For those of you that have a Kindle Fire HDX, you will recognize the easy swipe type function. This allows you to drag your finger across the keyboard to type, which is much faster and easier to do than touch typing on a screen this size.<br/><br/>5. Price<br/>The price of this phone was the ultimate deciding factor in my decision to buy this phone. I wasn't sure whether I should go with this one or the older Lumia 520 which is selling for $49 at the moment. I decided to go with this one because it has 4G LTE, something that is lacking in most other phones in this price range. It is VERY fast and I've had no issue with loading times or download speeds. It's just as quick as my 1020 in this respect.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>1. Camera<br/>The worst thing about this phone is the poor camera quality. There is no forward facing camera, so no skype or selfies unless you stand in front of a mirror. It wasn't a deal breaker for me personally,but it is something to consider if you use your forward facing camera a lot. The back camera is a grainy 5 mp that has no flash. It works fairly well in daylight, but struggles to focus indoors and is very grainy and blurry in low lighting. It has a lot of nice features and the ability to change some settings, though. The video quality is mediocre, even worse than the stills. If taking photos isn't a priority for you or you can carry around a decent point and shoot as a substitute, then this won't be a major drawback. However, if you rely heavily on your phone as a camera, then you will be disappointed with the quality of this phone's camera. I feel that I should mention that I don't have much basis of comparison for other phones in the same class as I've only used higher end phones prior to getting this one. I imagine it's probably on par with them, though. For a phone under $100, you shouldn't really expect quality to match or replace your point and shoot.<br/><br/>2. Sound Quality<br/>The second biggest concern I have with this phone (after camera) is that the sound quality in calls is rather tinny. It's not so bad that I'm going to return it, but it's the worst sound quality I've heard since my Motorola Razr went on the fritz in the early 2000's lol. I did some research on this phone to see if others had this experience. I seem to be in the minority, so it may be I got a bad phone or maybe that the T-Mobile version is slightly better. The mic quality is fine, though, as everyone I've spoken to has reported that I sound perfectly clear on their end. The audio quality of speakers is just okay. If you're an audiophile, you will want to invest in a good pair of earbuds.<br/><br/>A couple of other issues I've noticed: the youtube app doesn't work (but hopefully this will be resolved soon.) An app for Amazon Music is allegedly in the works, which I am really looking forward to as I am a prime customer. It came preloaded with the kindle app and there is an Amazon shopping app available in the store. I was considering the Fire Phone and going with the next installment plan, but figured I will eventually have access to all of my Amazon content. Obviously, if you're heavily invested in Google Play or in iTunes, Windows Phone is going to limit your experience and options. That said, there are many excellent apps for entertainment available.<br/><br/>IN SUMMARY:<br/><br/>This phone is much better than I expected for a phone at this price point. The camera quality leaves a lot to be desired, but otherwise it does everything you'd want from a Windows smartphone. It is a good choice for those on a budget or in need of a temporary phone. It is not as good of a choice for those who are expecting stellar performance on par with higher end phones, have a need for a quality camera, or are heavily invested in other ecosystems. If money is not an issue, then there are other choices out there worth considering. But be assured, this is a high quality device. After using my 4 year old HTC for the past few months, this is a decidedly good upgrade. The HTC was considered one of the best in 2010. Its camera and flash are still better than the 635, but the 635 outperforms on all other points. However, the 635 doesn't compare to the monsters of smartphone technology that exist today. My 1020 looms a large shadow over this little lumia.<br/><br/>I think the 635 meets expectations for what it is; however, I've deducted a point for the camera quality, and moreover, for the in-call sound quality as my expectations for any phone, regardless of price, are that it operate optimally as a phone. That said, the smartphone experience on this phone surpasses expectations. Cortana, 4G LTE speed, settings, interface, and the quality of the apps available make it an attractive and worthy consideration as a budget phone.<br/><br/>I will update this review once I have a better feel for battery life and should any other issues arise. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.
I've had it a little over a week now and I'm really enjoying this phone.  I upgraded from the Lumia 520 because I was starting to have problems with it (the buttons on the side weren't working any more.)  They made some noticeable improvements on this year's model without really increasing the price.<br/>Pros<br/>Screen size:  its a little bigger.  I've heard people say the resolution isn't as good, but I haven't noticed.  it looks about the same quality to me.  This is the biggest screen I've had on a smartphone and its really nice.<br/>Build quality:  it seems a little sturdier than the 520.  the back battery cover can't come off as easily.  The buttons have a more solid feel and don't stick out as far.<br/>Battery:  I get about 2 days out of it with normal use.  that's texting, listening to music on it in the car.  not any games really.  It seems noticeably better than the 520's battery life to me.<br/>Weight:  this thing feels pretty light to me.  its a little lighter than my girlfriend's Lumia 928 and they have the same size screen.<br/>4g LTE: The 520 did not have LTE. I wasn't expecting to notice a difference between 4G and LTE, but loading videos and pages online is much faster.  That combined with the quicker processor makes it a pretty useful smartphone.<br/>Micro-Sd capacity:  This phone can take a 128 GB sd card.  Now that is a lot of space on a smart phone.  Especially considering how much you're going to pay to get one of the upscale phones that doesn't accept an sd card in a 32GB or 64GB model.  It actually seems outrageous to me how much people spend on an iphone with lots of memory when its so cheap to expand the memory on phones like this.  Right now I have a 64GB card in it that I paid around $35 for last christmas.  I have 2 shoeboxes of CDs stored on it in mp3 format if you need an idea of how much space that is.<br/>Cortana:  I thought this was going to be a stupid gimmick.  I anticipated NEVER using is.  So far it has been pretty useful.  She is VERY good at understanding what I say.  I love using her to find a certain song, artist or album in my library while I'm driving.  I've actually had cases where I said the wrong name of an album and she still figured out what I meant. She's great at grabbing me directions somewhere as well.  And from what I hear she is basically in her beta stage still and is getting lots of improvements soon.<br/><br/>Cons  (I realize these are going to be nitpicky)<br/>Camera button:  I always felt like having a camera button on the side was a Nokia trademark.  You have to use on-screen buttons to snap your pictures and videos on this phone.  its not a huge deal.  As far as the camera in general goes, it works fine.  No, it doesn't have a flash or a "selfie-cam", but at this price point I can't complain about the quality at all.<br/>touch-screen options:  This is very minor, but on the 520 I could double-tap the screen to wake it up.  This phone does not have this option for some reason.  Also, it doesn't have the "glance" feature where you can see the time and whatnot without actually waking the phone.  If this is a trade off for having the bigger screen, I'm completely fine with it though.<br/>RAM:  Only has 512mb of RAM.  I wish it had 1GB, but the quad core processor seems to make processes pretty quick and you really don't have to wait much for loading.<br/>Some of the Apps:  I've had a couple issues with some of the new apps.  The music player, for instance, takes minutes to load all the artists in my music library.  it can load the songs and albums list quickly, but artists just doesn't work.  I found a workaround for now...apparently the old music player from before 8.1 is written in still.  I had to download an app that was a shortcut to it.  it works great, so I'm using that until they fix the 8.1 music player.<br/><br/>Overall its a great phone.  To me, the bottom line is the price.  I can't imagine them making a better entry-level phone at this price range. I think the complaints in some of the bad reviews on here seem very picky, and don't reflect the price of the phone.  Like the camera.  Its a $99 phone...I don't see how they could've added a flash and higher res camera and still had a nice big screen and quadcore processor.  For me, having a fully-functional and responsive smartphone AND 128GB capacity mp3 player makes this phone a great value.
Last year, Nokia released the Nokia 520 and it became the best-selling Windows Phone of all time.  Not only was it a great deal in terms of pricing, but it was also a great phone.  So what could they do for a follow-up to their best seller?  They released the Nokia 635, which improves upon several aspects of the 520.<br/><br/>That is what we have here in this review.  First, let's discuss what a GoPhone is and what you can do with it.<br/><br/>There are two ways you can use a GoPhone.  A GoPhone can be used with its included SIM card or with your existing SIM card. If you want to use it with the included card, you'll need to follow the activation process with AT&T.;  The other option is to use an AT&T; SIM card you already have. If you need a backup phone, or broke your phone, and already have an activated AT&T; SIM card, you can pick up one of these and pop your SIM card in it.  You do not need to do anything with the included SIM card if you use your existing SIM.  In fact, there is a sticker on the back of this phone that basically says that existing AT&T; users just need to pop in their SIM card. That is what I did.  In my case, I chose to use my existing nano SIM card from my Lumia 1520 to test out this phone.  I simply placed the nano SIM in a micro SIM adapter tray, since this phone uses a micro SIM card.<br/><br/>With everything I state in this review, keep in my how affordable this phone is.  This is a mid tier phone, at a rock bottom price (relative to the latest and greatest of today).<br/><br/>The blister pack packaging (sealed plastic container) is very difficult to open.  I cut it open with scissors and because the packaging is rounded plastic, cutting it with scissors was difficult.<br/><br/>The package contains the phone, an 1830 maH removable battery, sim card, start guides, and the charger with integrated USB cable.<br/><br/>The matte black plastic back of this phone is very difficult to pry off.  I ended up using a credit card to help pry it open.<br/><br/>Compared to last year's Lumia 520, this phone has a larger screen, feels better in the hand, and looks more modern.  This phone also features LTE, which the 520 did not.  Other changes from last year include the new Windows 8.1, the removal of the hardware camera button, and the switch to onscreen navigation buttons (like some Android phones).  There is no camera flash on this phone and the 5 megapixel camera lens is a very very small bump on the back of the phone.  The volume control and power button, while clicky, feel a little bit too recessed and take some getting used to.  I was impressed to see the buttons had plastic on them for protection during shipping. The good thing about the recessed buttons is that if you pick up the phone by its sides, it is not easy to accidentally press a button.  The beveled edges make it easy to grip, as does the matte black plastic.<br/><br/>This phone is 802.11 b, g, and n compatible. It also has Bluetooth 4.0, which you can use to pair with a headset, earpeice, or your automobile.  It works on AT&T;'s LTE network.<br/><br/>It comes with 8GB of internal storage and the microSD card support goes all the way up to 128GB cards.<br/><br/>Setup is easy, and includes creating or signing in with a Microsoft account.  I chose to restore from a previous Windows Phone, which worked flawlessly.  It detected my SD card and asked me if I wanted to store my media on it.  After my restore, I had 3.88GB free on the internal storage.<br/><br/>The 4.5 inch screen is not a super high resolution screen, but is good enough.  It comes in a 217ppi.  Because Windows Phone uses big text, the resolution is not a big deal.  It is 854x480 and features Nokia's Clear Black technology.  If you are familiar with the iPhone 5 or 5s, the body of this phone is similarly sized. It is approximately the same height, and just a little wider than the iPhone.  It fits comfortably in the hand.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Nokia should have increased the RAM to 1GB when they designed this phone. There is only 512mb of RAM in this phone, and the user experience of this phone usually doesn't suffer as a result of this low amount of RAM.  Some higher-end games may have an issue, but Windows phone does a great job with low specs.  The only time I ran into an issue, (since I am not a gamer) is when pinch-zooming on webpages with small text.  This phone takes a second to re-render the text and during that second or two, it is noticeably blurry.  For a budget-priced phone though, this is something that you can live with.<br/><br/>The Windows Phone keyboard continues to be my favorite among phone keyboards.<br/><br/>I mentioned the 5 megapixel camera on the back.  There is no front-facing camera on this phone.  The quality of the photos from the camera are ok.  I would not expect quality photos at night though.  This camera isn't anything like a 6 element lens of iPhones or the 41 megapixel Nokia 1020, but it does its job.  It does offer the highly praised Nokia Camera application, like the Nokia 1020 and 1520.<br/><br/>Speaking of the Nokia apps, they are always nice features and a great reason to buy a Nokia-made (Now owned by Microsoft) Windows Phone. These include Nokia Camera, Nokia Cinemagraph, Here Maps, and Nokia Creative Studio just to name a few of the more popular ones.<br/><br/>Windows Phone 8.1 brings several new features to Windows Phone that iOS and Android have had for a while.  Windows Phone 8.1 now features Cortana, the digital assistant and the Action Center, which is much like the notification dropdown of Android and iOS.  This device also comes with the latest Lumia Cyan release.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a excellent value. The size of the phone is perfect in my opinion.  As a quad core, it is fast.  Windows Phone has always felt fast regardless of the chip set.  If you are looking for a Windows Phone, this is an excellent choice.  In terms of specs, it is comparable to the Mote G with LTE and the HTC Desire 610.  As an owner of the Nokia Lumia 1520, I have to admit that this phone is much nicer in daily use.  It is not the powerhouse that the Lumia 1520 is, but this phone sure is a lot more comfortable to hold and provides almost the same experience.  Plus, you can purchase a few different color backs and interchange them as you see fit.<br/><br/>Enjoy your phone!
This is my fifth cell phone in the past 6 years, and my second smartphone. I previously had the Nokia lumia 520 which I got back in the summer of 2013. I liked it at first and everything, however I dropped it and it smashed. The screen was very poorly cracked. Also, even before I smashed it, some of the side buttons were not working, and also it would never hold a decent charge. Like, I would charge it and then just texting or surfing the web for a little bit, would drain the battery about 1 percent per minute, if not more. Also the charger was crappy and would many times never charge the phone.<br/><br/>I have had gophone for 5 years now. I've never had a contract. Mainly because I am a student and I don't have the money for a real contract since I pay my phone. I do the 25 dollars a month plan which gives me unlimited texting and 250 talking minutes. It is perfect for me, since I hardly ever use my phone for talking. I just text, and use wifi for internet. I thought about switching to a contract because I wanted a data plan as well as a high-end phone. However, that would be like 720 a year just for the plan in total, as well as 99-200 just for the phone on top of that, plus phone insurance etc. Once I get a real job after I finish school, maybe I will get a contract phone, but for now, gophone is just fine for me.<br/><br/>Anyways, I was looking at some of the unlocked high end phones, but could not make a decision what to buy. Mainly because they were so expensive and I wanted to make sure I bought the right one before forking over that much money. What sucks is that every season they come out with different phones that have the latest technology, so phones become passe very quickly. Thats the problem. Why should I spend 500-700 bucks on a phone that will be outdated next year? Not worth it.<br/><br/>I was in the ATT store a few weeks ago when I stumbled across this phone. Since I already had the 520 I was familiar with Nokia. To my surprise, I actually liked this phone BETTER than the high end ones while I was playing with it! The screen is SOOO much better than the 520. Yes, technically it has way fewer pixles than HD phones, but who cares? I am here to tell you that I can hardly tell the difference between this phone's display and hd screens. Since the phone has a very high brightness level, it makes the phone look near HD most times. I mean, compared to other budget phones (even one of the htc budget phones that costs 100 bucks more), this screen is spectacular. Most non-contract budget phones have washed out looking screens and very limited brightness. In a few words: they suck. But not this one. The only time I can actually tell the difference that this is not hd is when reading small text. Small text looks bad on this phone unless you zoom in, but that is expected. Some pictures (such as album artwork from my music library) look pretty bad because you can make out the pixels, but other than that, games look pretty sweet on this phone (I have supermonkeyball 2, flappy bird, etc), and videos look good too. The screen is nice and glossy and I love the way the gorilla glass 3 feels. It feels much nicer than the 520, especially since this has clear black display, so colors appear richer and more true. This phone comes with 8gb of ram, but honestly, just get a Micro SD card and you will be good to go. I'm getting a 32 Gb sd card that I saw from samsung on here for 17.99. That should totally suffice.<br/><br/>This phone also has a qualcomm snapdragon quad-core processor. What a difference the quad core makes over the dual core. The 520 was dual core, and it was fast most times, but loading times would be a drag. You don't have that problem with this one. Apps load up VERY fast. By very fast I mean literally a second if that. Even games too. My Flappy Bird app loaded in one second. Videos can be a bit slow when you first play them, but for a budget phone I won't complain much.<br/><br/>Cortana. Now, everyone raves about cortana. I don't see anything special about her, because literally it is just like a bing search without you typing it in. If you do a manual bing or google search on your own, it is much faster than cortana. I don't get why people even bother with siri or cortana. Also she only works when you have internet connection. Even if you want to text someone using her, you cant unless you have internet.<br/><br/>The only downside to the windows 8.1 software in my opinion that I would like to see improved would be us able to customize our backgrounds in our text message screens. That would be really cool. It looks so plain against a black or white screen.<br/><br/>Also, people complain about the lack of apps windows has. They have 300k apps, which is more than enough. Honestly, I found nearly every app I was looking for in the windows store. So don't worry about lack of apps! Windows is catching up and they add more apps everyday! The only downside is that there are a great amount of games that aren't free, but other than that it is fine.<br/><br/>Another thing I love about this phone is that if you want to send someone a text but don't feel like typing it out, you can simply press the microphone button in the message screen and literally say out loud an entire conversation, and the phone will convert your voice into a text message pretty clearly and accurately. Isn't that awesome??! The phone can also read aloud news articles for you if you don't feel like reading them yourself.<br/><br/>One last issue with the phone is that it has no front facing camera. But then again, for 100 bucks what do u expect? If you take a lot of selfies, this is not the phone for you. Nokia has a glam me app, which allows you to take selfies, but I don't know how accurate that would be. For me, I never take selfies (having to look at pics of myself just seems narcisssitic and makes me cringe), but I do use skype so it's a bummer I can't video chat, but whatever. I have my laptop for video calling anyway. You can still use skype though. (It you really want them to see you, you can do it in front of a mirror lol), and you can still see them, and if you don't care about the camera aspect, you can just use skype like a traditional call. (I like that, because again, I have 250 minutes for the month, so i can call using skype for free on my wifi)<br/><br/>If you do get this phone, make sure you download the app called "music+" It is a music streaming service all free (you dont even have to sign up or anything or make an account), and you can take the songs offline too! All free! Its amazing. I downloaded 100 songs, and they have like millions to choose from.<br/><br/>Also it's nice that Microsoft office is built into this phone as well as the one drive cloud storage. Also onenote is included as well, which is great for me since I love taking notes. I have a windows 8.1 laptop, so it is nice that everything syncs so easily on my phone without me having to do anything. It just does it all automatically.<br/><br/>Everyone should definitely take a look at this phone. This is a great phone for kids too! Why get the kids an expensive iphone that they could break and smash, when you could get them this one?? I know someone with the iphone 5s and even he says that my phone looks better than his! He says the screen is much brighter.<br/><br/>I also want to add that this phone gave me 12 hours of battery life! That was me using it at full blast brightness, listening to some music, and reading kindle books all day as well as texting. However if you watch videos or play games it will eat up battery faster.<br/><br/>But anyways yeah, go with this!!! It is literally the BEST budget phone you can buy. PERIOD. Don't waste your money on an iphone for over 600 bucks that you have to replace every year to upgrade. Just get this. You can upgrade next year and it will only cost you 100 bucks for the Nokia that comes out in the fall of 2015. So worth it. I bet the next Nokia budget phone will even have a front facing camera and 720 pixel resolution. Don't fall for the apple fad. People who put down windows phones have no idea what they are talking about.<br/><br/>BTW if you really want that HD look, make sure that when you get the phone, you set the screen background to "light" instead of dark, so you have a white backdrop instead of the default black. Believe me it looks MUCH better on the light. Especially at full blast brightness.<br/><br/>Also PS: I have dropped this phone face down many times by accident on stone tile, hardwood, etc. Yet no scratch or buff on it period! It still looks brand new. I even dropped it from a 4 foot countertop onto hard flooring and nothing.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/>April 10th, 2014<br/><br/>Okay, what I have noticed recently is that this phone will freeze a lot, to the point where I have to take the battery out and leave it out for a few minutes and then put it back in. In addition, sometimes I will be on twitter or just texting, and the phone will start clicking random letters and writing random things without my consent, to the point where I again, have to take the battery and put it back in. A couple months ago the phone was so badly frozen, I had to put it back to a system restore.<br/><br/>You know the thing about this phone is that its very snappy in the beginning, but if you have it for about six months, it starts to lag. You really get what you pay for. Its a $50 phone (I bought it in the late summer for $100), so you aren't gonna get the quality of an iPhone or a nice high end android. I would just be careful is all. Also, some apps like twitter, I had uninstalled and now want back, but no matter what I do, the system wont let me reinstall it (even though I have the room!).<br/><br/>I will say one feature I really like is the built in navigation from HERE maps. Its completely free, even offline you can use it without wifi. Its been great. I love that its free and it still talks to you and corrects you on how to get to the destination. For that alone, this phone is worth it.<br/><br/>Also, they have added more apps to the windows app store recently. They are always adding more apps which is good. But it still PALES in comparison to android and IOS. Plus, even the ones they do have on here, they are never updated. Period. So good luck having fun with that. Even bank of America pulled its app off the store recently which ticked me off. They said there aren't enough windows phone users, so they didn't want to keep the app on there. That's another problem with windows phones. No one gives them a chance, and therefore no one wants to make or update apps for them. Its really a domino effect.<br/><br/>Its a fine phone overall with a nice screen (even tho its not HD....if you want HD, wait for the lumia 640 which is coming out this month for about $150 I think. Plus that one is 5 inches and has a 8 megapixel camera and 1 megapixel front facing camera). I just feel like this phone is a better back up phone, than a primary phone. If you aren't really a power user, this can be a fine primary phone. But if you are a power user, get something with more horsepower.<br/><br/>Also, if you care about your privacy, perhaps think twice about this phone. Microsoft sees all of your text messages, web browsing history, looks at all of your photos and videos, etc. I read the privacy agreement and I honestly was shocked that they were that "watchful". So to be honest, I may switch to Apple because of that.
If the user for the necessary features that will satisfy 100% of Windows Phone.<br/>Be very pleased to purchase quality products at affordable prices.
I bought this phone about 2 weeks ago. I was looking for a pay as you go phone that wasn't super expensive, but still allowed for all the perks of a smart phone. I have to admit that I wasn't sure I'd like this phone. I'm not a big fan of Windows, but I was pleasantly surprised. While it has the usually Windows 8 icons, they can be resized to be reminiscent of iPhones. I've found that the app store has all the apps I normally use on my iPod touch. It's not giant like the newer phones so it fits very comfortably in the palm of my hand. It has one back facing 5mp camera that takes pretty good photos (see the examples of photos I've taken below). It was very easy to set up and I love the fact that the entire back case comes off so you can replace the battery if necessary. It comes with a sim card and a slot for an SD card. I had a 16gb sd card already so I just slid that into place and have tons of memory, although the phone does come with 8gb which would have been fine for awhile. I would recommend this phone to anyone. I can play games on it, take descent photos, surf the net, get on many and various social networking sites, text and on and on. I haven't really found anything I don't like about this phone.<br/><br/>I do have to say that the negative views I've seen are about the camera. Now, as you can see the photos I took are very good. They haven't been doctored at all, this is exactly what I got when I took the photos. I do have to say that if you are someone that takes selfies, this isn't the phone for you. That's been the basis of a lot of bad reviews (the fact that it doesn't have a front facing camera for selfies). I'm not someone who cares about constantly taking selfies so that's not a problem for me.
I am coming from an Apple iPhone 4s. Prior to that I had an iPhone 3s. Before Apple phones, I had Samsungs. Yes, the change to the iPhone 3s was amazing. And I really loved having the front-facing camera on the iPhone 4s. However, the only reasons why I had to really change phones from iP3s to iP4s was because the battery was dying and the iP3s couldn't quite keep up with the iOS updates. It's as if the updates were slowly making the phone more obsolete and draining its battery. Well, that is exactly what was going on with my iPhone4s. I could barely keep a charge on it for more than 4 hours. It would die at the most inconvenient times and I was frustrated with the new phone pricing plans from all three carriers that I would consider: AT&T;, T-Mobile, and Verizon. Who wants to lease a phone these days?  And at crazy data plan prices? It just made me sick with the whole idea of having to have a cell phone.<br/><br/>What I really wanted was the Samsung Note 4! I always wanted a Note phone. I knew that I didn't want another iPhone....they just don't seem revolutionary anymore. I was bored with the iOS and with the same old phone style!<br/><br/>Never I thought I would get a Windows phone. I mean, I didn't even care for Microsoft products period. Until I got a touch screen laptop (Lenovo Yoga2) with Windows 8. I really enjoyed all the features of having a laptop capable of being so much more...more than any kind of Apple laptop could be at this time. And I do like Apple products...but lately, I am just yawning when I walk into an Apple store.<br/><br/>Using Windows on the laptop made me look into the Lumia Windows phones. I was definitely curious. If I didn't have to pay exorbitant prices for the top of the line Lumia, I would have purchased a Lumia 1520. However, the perfect opportunity presented itself over Christmas when the Lumia 635 No Contract Phone was selling for under $60. It had most of the features I wanted and honestly, has not left me sad or unsatisfied for ditching my iPhone4s.<br/><br/>What I really love about the Lumia 635:<br/>1. No Contract on AT&T.; I actually reduced my monthly expense and increased my data plan at the same time!<br/>2. My battery lasts more than 24 hours! More with less usage. I do use it for a lot of texting, checking emails, making appointments and reminders, taking care of banking stuff, wake up alarm, surfing the Web for news and Facebook, and to listen to music in addition to phone calls.<br/>3. It works as a personal hotspot. Great feature when there are no free Wi-Fi spots and I need to do work on my laptop. It is seamless.<br/>4. Less than $60! That is it. No leasing. No additional fees.<br/>5. Easy to switch from iPhone 4s. I simply put in my SIM card from the iPhone 4s and I was ready to make calls!<br/>6. If the battery begins to die, I can buy a new one and replace it myself.<br/>7. If I need more storage space, the 8 GB is expandable to 128 GB.  Comes with 15GB of OneDrive (Microsoft's version of Apple's iCloud).<br/>8. Very sturdy and simple yet handsome enough phone.<br/>9. If I am about 20% left of battery life, the phone goes into "saver" mode where it will allow texts and phone calls to get through in order to extend that 20% of battery life until you can recharge.<br/>10. When recharging, it does a nice quick job. It seemed like my iPhone 4S had to wait overnight to fully recharge. The Lumia 635 recharges in about 1.5 hours.<br/>11. Has speed dial! And you can quickly add a contact to your screen tiles to instantly call/text.<br/>12. Has free pedometer and diet tracker (just as cool as the Weight Watchers Points app but free!!!!) to help you keep healthy!<br/><br/>Here's what I really like about the Lumia 635:<br/>1. It's a bigger screen than the iPhone 4s. So I can read things better.<br/>2. It's very customizable. Personalize your tiles the way you like. No one's screen will look the same.<br/>3. Sound quality on calls....great.<br/>4. Perfect size. Fits in my pant pockets, shirts, carrying case, car compartment.<br/>5. Easily integrates with my car's Bluetooth system.<br/>6. Easily integrates with my Windows laptop.<br/>7. Good speaker sound quality.<br/><br/>****<br/>I'm tired of being forced to buy new products when I am not ready to buy them. The iPhone 4s with its draining battery and more and more demanding iOS updates simply just left the phone useless. I hated it. I wanted to smash it to pieces everytime the damn battery died within hours of just charging it.<br/><br/>Without having to lease a new iPhone, I was pleasantly surprised by the Amazing Lumia 635 and how quick it is, beautiful Windows 8.1 is, and despite not having everything that I was used to with my iPhone 4s, I am still happier with this less than $60 brand new phone that helped me reduce my monthly phone bill!<br/><br/>****<br/>What is missing from the Lumia 635 that I used on my iPhone 4s?<br/>1. Front-facing camera. Yes, I was getting caught up in the selfies before selfies even became selfies. It's nice to have a break from that actually!<br/>2. Flash. The Lumia 635 does not have flash for pictures. I actually liked using my iPhone 4s as a backup flashlight. Can't do that with the Lumia 635.<br/>3. Some apps that are in the Apple Store are not at the Windows Store. It's a shame really because this is the biggest gripe I have read over and over about people even thinking about switching to a Windows phone. For me, I've assimilated and found other ways to access what I need on the Windows phone. Not too much of a loss really.<br/>4. I thought my iPhone 3s took better pictures than the iPhone 4s. Although the picture quality got worse through an iOS upgrade, the Lumia 635 picture quality is not that amazing; especially when flash would be handy. This won't be much of a great camera phone.<br/><br/>Other than that, I can't really complain about my Windows Lumia 635 phone.<br/><br/>Find yourself in a pinch to replace your phone but don't want to lease and pay $800, $900, or even over $1,000? Your kids need a cell phone? You've grown bored with iPhones or Samsungs? I truly believe this Lumia 635 is a great way to get introduced into the Windows 8 environment. There is a Lumia out there for everyone. This one is a step up above the entry level Lumia 520. But for better pictures, front-facing cameras included, etc., at a more expensive cost, you can at Lumia 800s, 900s, 1000s, 1300s, and 1500s (as in 1520).<br/><br/>This phone does not disappoint. It opens up a different way to communicate with the world! Without going broke.
I have extensively used Lumia 520 and got this one as an update (notice, not upgrade).<br/><br/>While I didn't expect functionality of higher end phones from Lumia 635, I am disappointed to find out a lot of small useful hardware gone comparing with old Lumia 520:<br/>- No brightness sensor, so your screen won't adjust to the ambient lighting and you have to keep manually changing brightness (luckily new version of windows phone allows that easy from pull down menu, but not so easy as it used to be automatic).<br/>- No sunlight readability mode. It was very helpful and amazing feature unique to Lumia phones. (My guess it requires the brightness sensor.)<br/>- No touchscreen high sensitivity mode. Take your gloves off like in the old days. I really miss using my Lumia 520 with any gloves on, especially now that the weather turned freezing cold.<br/>- No camera side button anymore. Screen tapping only. I remember when Microsoft was a stickler about it and mandated all Windows Phones must have hardware camera button as licensing prerequisite. And quality of photos are about the same or a tad worse than on the 520.<br/>- No proximity sensor, which means your phone doesn't know for sure if you are looking at it or it is against your cheek in a call. Also you can NOT hang up in Skype calls, but have to ask the other person to end the call, since the phone treats your fingers like your ears and shuts off the screen when you try to touch it.<br/>- Processor is not as fast and responsive as some websites had touted. Day to day use is about as fast as dual core 520. I think usability has more to do with RAM than with the number of cores. Skype is just as slow.<br/>- Still no compass with GPS.<br/>- The screen is nice and bright, but seeing light from back LED's at the top of the screen is not exciting. Especially with new Windows phone OS pull down menu I look there a lot.<br/>- Audio quality from headphone jack is much much worse, which is my biggest grudge. I used to really enjoy 520 with Fiio amp on my AKG K701. Lumia 635 audio sounds really tiny and bright. Soundstage is not there. Amazing how much of a step back.<br/><br/>There are also some software changes that are not positive, such as missing agenda view from the calendar or music app that doesn't index SD card correctly, but overall the new version of windows phone is nicer. It is however now available as an update for the best selling 520 as well.<br/><br/>For positive changes please see a million other reviews that in detail (or not) talk about: Cortana, IPS Gorilla Glass screen (which is actually very helpful now that Windows Phone has Swype keyboard), and few other.
I've had a lot of different experiences with a lot of different phones. Coming from the days of the blackberry curve line, the last experience with blackberry being the curve 3G series, I took a leap years ago to the iPhone 4. I've always been a very basic, budget minded and simple smartphone user; and the iPhone met all of my needs simply. Then, I started to see the growth of the smartphone market around me; and after owning an iPhone 4 for a solid two years with no complaints, I took the leap to android finally with the galaxy s3. The galaxy s3 was an amazing phone, and to this day I love android more than any operating system, but I found myself missing the simplicity of IOS. Within the past year I've gone back and forth between platforms, switching on and off between my iPhone 4 and my samsung galaxy s3. I had at some point upgraded to an iPhone 5C, but was severely disappointed with the lack of change or innovation from apple; so I gave the phone to my father and went back to my iPhone 4. My iPhone 4 fell to its demise in the summer, and my samsung s3 is still 100% functional but has cracks across the screen. I like to try new operating systems and experience new innovation; and I was kind of tired of having an expensive $600 smartphone when I didn't really need all of the gimmicks and extras at the price. I was at walmart recently and noticed the lumia 520 on sale for $50, so I went for it in order to finally try the windows experience.<br/><br/>Having owned the Lumia 520 for two months, it was an incredible and solid phone. It really was one of the best phones I had ever owned, and I loved it so much more than any iPhone I had owned, but I still love the android ecosystem more than any other platform. A few weeks ago I saw that at&t; was giving a trade in at $200 for an iPhone, so I took my demised iPhone for trade in and walah, $200! So, I decided to not spend the entire gift card on anything flashy or fancy, but instead I put $100 of the gift card towards this gem of a phone.<br/><br/>This phone is a TRUE and amazing upgrade to the 635. I see a lot of mixed reviews on how people don't know if it is an upgrade or not in comparison to the 520, but it really is. The 520 is an amazing phone, but if you can spare the money you should get this one instead. Yes, there is no dedicated camera key, there is no ambient light sensor; but those are just really the two main knock offs from the 520. The build quality is amazing compared to the 520, it looks like an iPhone 5C but looks and feels more solid. The battery life on this phone is also spectacular, with average-heavy usage I get at least two days out of it. Sometimes if I barely use the phone also, just a few calls, texts, emails per day - I can get almost 3-4 days of usage. The battery is larger than the 520, which is why the battery life is a lot better than the 520. The screen resolution may be less than the 520; and other people have reported how the screen is almost the same size, well it basically is. The screen real estate is larger on the 635 because of the on-screen buttons now compared to the physical buttons on the 520, but the screen is actually a tad bit bigger; and to be honest the ClearBlack technology makes it a lot sharper and brighter than the 520. I could keep going into an in depth review, but basically this is a very amazing, nifty, and speedy device. I love the windows software, even though it has some limitations, it has no quirks, glitches, and is even more fluid in my opinion than the IOS software.<br/><br/>The software on this phone is spectacular, the build quality is fantastic, the screen is clear, the on screen keyboard is so easy to use, everything about this phone is simple and awesome. After using high end smartphones, this phone has made me reconsider why would people spend all of this money on these high end devices when you can have something affordable and simple that does all of the same things. Yes, it doesn't have a front-facing camera or the best high end back camera, and I do love taking pictures of scenery, etc. But for a 5 megapixel shooter with no flash, this takes really good pictures. Just, get this phone you won't regret it!
Paying hundreds of dollars for a phone to just be locked into a contract is blah. You hear that Amazon!? I guess so as the Fire Phone has decreased from $200 to 99 cents, but still with a contract! Anyway, for a hundred bucks this phone does everything I want it to do.<br/><br/>I'm coming from the Lumia 520, which really set the bar for affordable smart phones. The great thing with this phone is that Windows 8.1 and Cortana are already installed on the device. Saves a bit of time, but the screen gets bumped up to 4.5 inches, adds a few more pixels, gets a hardware boost from a dual core to a Quad core, 1200 MHz, ARM Cortex-A7, and comes with a larger battery giving you about 4 more hours of talk time.<br/><br/>Being fairly new to the whole smart phone thing I was literally blown away by the personal assistant Cortana. The voice recognition is spot on, even with my heavy Jersey accent. Being able to tell her anything, from calling someone, to setting appointments, all the way to having her send texts for you! No more typing--which is kind of a big deal to someone like myself who takes 27 minutes to try and type out a 2 sentence text.<br/><br/>I think the camera takes great pictures but there's a ton of apps you can download to tweak them too. Speaking of apps, there aren't as many as an Android or iPhone device but more are added every day. As I said, being new to the smart phone game I was blown away by all the free apps you can download. Maps for navigation, ringtones, games, and a slew off other apps--for free!<br/><br/>The built in WI-Fi was huge for me as I refuse to buy a data plan. I pay a hefty price for home internet service and simply hated being forced to buy a data plan. This is why I love not being locked into a carrier/contract. As I use my home Wi-Fi and pretty much every public place I go to has free Wi-Fi the omission of a data plan saves me a bundle.<br/><br/>The only downsides I can see are there's no flash on the camera and there's no front facing camera. In all honesty the front facing camera is no big deal. I can hardly stand talking to people face to face in person, let alone having to see them on my phone too! The flash I really would've liked to have and can't figure why one isn't added even to budget phones--how much can it possibly add to the cost? Oh yeah, they also removed the dedicated camera button! It's more of an annoyance than anything else, but still...I liked my camera button. :(<br/><br/>All in all I absolutely love this phone. The reception is great, the volume is loud enough, all the free apps, and the large screen size all fit my needs. It's Cortana that's the gold star in my eyes though. I asked if she would marry me and she said she doesn't think that's in the cards for us but I still think it's the beginning of a beautiful relationship!
I cracked the screen on my Lumia 830 so I bought this as a backup. Boy, am I impressed! So the camera is not as good as the 830's and it doesn't have a flash or a front facing camera, but for its price you can't beat this phone! The Lumia Selfie app resolves the lack of front facing camera, and even without the flash this camera (5MP) takes decent pictures. Windowsphone is a really cool OS and it grows on you if you give it a chance. Really wish Devs would support it better. I also think this the perfect size, not too big, not too small. The back shell comes out and you can buy different color ones for about $10. The green shell is pretty rocking I think. Almost forgot, the battery life on this thing is AMAZING!
I purchased this phone during Best Buy’s four hour sale for $19.95 as a backup phone.  In fact, because the price was so low, I purchased three of them so everyone with a phone in my family could have a backup.  I once watched my son’s (not yet paid off) Samsung S4 fly off a rollercoaster.<br/><br/>I’m on T-Mobile and this is an AT&T; GoPhone.  I was able to go on AT&T;’s web site and unlock all them for free! (more on the unlocking later)<br/><br/>As a backup phone, I’m impressed.  I’ve been using it as my daily driver for a week and it does everything I need it to do.  I’ve read a few reviews that say this is a great backup phone, great first smartphone, and great phone for your kids.  All true depending on how you use your phone.  For me it does everything I need it to do but I’m not a Snapchater or and Instramer.<br/><br/>My normal daily driver has been an LG G2 and an OnePlus One.  Both Android based phones.<br/><br/>Let’s start with the bad…<br/>The camera…Only 5 megapixel with no flash.  Pictures are ok in good lighting but poor in low light.  No front facing camera so no selfies without a mirror and forget about Skype.  Well, technically, you can still use Skype for calls, just no video<br/><br/>Only 8GB of internal storage, but an expansion slot is available.<br/><br/>The text messenger app.  It’s functional but runs into issues if you have a contact that has multiple cell phones.  If the send you a text from both, it ends up in the same thread and when they respond, you can’t tell which texts came from which number.  This is a huge pain.  On an android phone, it will break the texts up into separate threads.<br/><br/>The on screen keyboard.  You have to switch to another keyboard to get numbers and special characters, like the $, %, etc.<br/><br/>The apps.  This really isn’t the phones fault but the Windows store is significantly behind the Apple App Store and the Google Play store.  My guess is that if you’re a developer, trying to make a buck, you’re going to go with the platform where there are more phones and maximize your ability to make money.  It’s funny to me, that a software company as big as Microsoft, has trouble giving you the apps and functionality to make their phones more successful.<br/><br/>If there were more apps, it could fix the texting and keyboard issues here.  On Android there are plenty of free texting apps and keyboards to choose from.<br/><br/>Email and Text notifications.  When you get a text or an email, you have a notification in the notification bar at the top of the screen.  The problem is it’s the same notification whether it’s an email or a text or both.  They are not separate.<br/><br/>Now, for the good…<br/>Price, even if you pay $50 for this phone, where else are you going to get a smartphone that you can unlock for less than that?<br/><br/>It’s 4G LTE speeds for data.  I tested this out with the SpeedTest app and this phone is every bit as fast as my flagship Android phones for data speeds.<br/><br/>Call quality.  Calls are very clear on the phone and on a Bluetooth headset.<br/><br/>Car Mode.  This is pretty awesome.  If you connect a Bluetooth device, your car’s Bluetooth counts, you can set the phone up to automatically go into car mode.  This allows the phone to read your text messages to you and for you to respond to them, all without touching the phone.  I tested this out and it works great.<br/><br/>The ability to put different emails into the email app.  I have a windows live, yahoo, gmail, and work based IMAP email account all working in this application.<br/><br/>Google contacts integration.  When hooking up Gmail, it also pulls in the contacts, a huge plus for me as my phones have been Android phones for years now.<br/><br/>The size of the phone.  It may be just me but I’m getting a little tired of these huge phones.  Anything that has a screen bigger than 5 inches is too big.  Too big in my pocket, too big in my hand.  This phone has a 4.5 inch screen.  The phone is light and easy to put in and out of a pocket.<br/><br/>Cortona – This was a pleasant surprise.  Putting in reminders and calendar events are fast and easy.  Also, just asking for directions will automatically find the place you are looking for and pull up HERE maps.<br/><br/>HERE maps – not as good as Google maps, put pretty darn good.  Turn by turn directions and a nice… added bonus, the street limit signs right on the screen so you know what the speed limit is.  Also, you can download the entire North America map right to your phone.<br/><br/>Expandable storage.  You can add expandable storage, but I’m not sure the maximum amount, I think it’s 128GB.  The great thing about the expandable storage on a windows phone is that you can actually use it to install applications, not just for pictures, music, and movies.<br/><br/>For only 512MB memory, this phone is pretty snappy.  The animations are smooth and fast.<br/><br/>For a non HD display, the screen looks really good.  Not as good as HD but good.<br/><br/>I know I said the app store was weaker, and it is, but most of the primary apps are there.  Facebook, twitter, Instagram, NetFlix, Amazon, Youtube (not from Microsoft, other vendors, Microsoft’s app is simply a link to the mobile Youtube page)<br/><br/>You can unlock this phone for free.  The techs and Best Buy said you can’t but they are wrong.<br/><br/>How to unlock this phone.<br/>1. Do not turn the phone on, don’t even open the box.<br/>2. Go to this web site: https://www.att.com/deviceunlock/?#/<br/>3. Check I have read and agree to the eligibility requirements to unlock my device.<br/>4. This is super important, check Non-AT&T; Mobility Customer<br/>5. Fill out the form, including the IMEI number which is located on the Box<br/>6. Submit<br/>7. You will be sent an email with a link to confirm<br/>8. Open your email and confirm<br/>9. Anywhere from 1 hour to 48 hours you will be given an unlock code.  It took 8 hours for me to receive mine.<br/>10. Open up the box, put in your SIM from your Carrier and turn it on.<br/>11. You will be prompted for the unlock code<br/>12. Put it in and continue.<br/><br/>If you don’t get an unlock code for some reason, return the phone without opening the box. I bought three phones, and got unlock codes for all three.<br/><br/>One more thing…Do NOT, I repeat, DO NOT upload the Windows 10 preview.  It rendered the phone almost unusable.  Fortunately, Microsoft created a program to revert the phone back to windows 8.1.<br/><br/>Overall, I still prefer the Android experience over windows.  I think Microsoft has a lot of catching up to do if it could ever hope to overtake the smartphone market.  That’s it, I hope this helps.
I got this phone to replace an older AT&T; GoPhone and am loving it so far. I considered getting the new iPhone, but didn't want a contract or to pay full retail price for an unlocked iPhone. This Nokia phone seemed to have the features I wanted at a fraction of the iPhone price, so after using it for about a month now, I'm so glad I got this phone. It's a bargain for how much it has to offer.<br/><br/>I never had a Windows phone before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised at how many things you can customize on this phone compared to the other phone I had. Icons of different apps and features can be moved around, resized and you can choose which ones you want and don't want on your main screen. It's easy to customize everything from ringtones, backgrounds, security/passwords, apps, storage, and much more. From the 'User Settings Menu', you can totally personalize the phone to suit your preferences. I use mostly Apple products, so the Windows interface took some getting used to, but it's pretty simple to use and is easy to customize the phone to what features/apps are most important to you.<br/><br/>The phone itself works great: clear reception on calls, no dropped calls, easy to adjust volume, no technical problems or freezing. Videos and YouTube play nicely and the speakers project sound well. This is the second Nokia phone I've had and like the first, this one works well and is trouble-free. I've been using it a lot and it's never frozen or not worked when I need it.<br/><br/>I did find out that this phone doesn't have too much internal storage space and after adding some apps, photos, videos, etc, the phone was getting close to its capacity. I purchased a <br/> seperately. 32GB seems like more than enough space, so now I can add lots of apps, take photos, video and download music without worrying about the phone's storage being maxed out. In the phone's user settings, you can choose what things (like apps, for example) that you want to automatically be saved to the storage disk instead of on the phone. I think this option comes up when you first put the disk into the back of the phone and the phone automatically recognizes you added a disk.<br/><br/>The other accessories that I purchased for this phone are:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Good basic protection for everyday use.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cuts down on fingerprints, glare, easy to put on and keep the screen scratch-free.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Very convenient if you're out and your battery gets low.<br/><br/>These have all worked great with my phone.<br/><br/>There are just a few things I don't like about this phone. It feels sort of heavy if I'm holding it for a while with longer calls. Maybe I'm just not used to a smartphone or should get a bluetooth headphone, but it's just something I noticed.<br/><br/>The battery life is okay, but seems like it could be better. I'm charging at least every other day and I'm not someone who uses my phone constantly. If I use the phone a lot, I charge it once a day. This is one of the reasons the car charger is helpful.<br/><br/>If you love taking selfies, this probably isn't the phone for you because there's no front-facing camera. The photo quality is good, but not great.<br/><br/>There have a been a couple occasions where an app didn't work with the phone, which is more of a Windows issue than a problem with the phone itself. For example, I downloaded the U-Stream app, but it wouldn't work. Annoying, but in general, most of the apps I downloaded work as they're supposed to.<br/><br/>For the price, I feel like this phone is a steal. I did quite a bit of research prior to ordering and couldn't find another smartphone in this price range with as many features and good quality.<br/><br/>I really like having a good quality smartphone with so many useful features without dealing with a contract. I definitely recommend this phone for someone who wants a versatile smartphone at a good price. 4.5 stars.
I was really surprised at the quality of this phone especially for the low cost barrier.<br/>-The phone itself is very slim and pretty lightweight.<br/>-Screen size is excellent and the quality of the screen is pretty good too.<br/>-4G LTE speed is very fast and it works great over AT&T;'s network. Additionally the Wifi is good on this device.<br/>-Phone is pretty fast and definitely a noticeable upgrade over the Lumia 520.<br/>-Call quality is excellent and the speakers and microphones work great.<br/>-Windows Phone 8.1 runs excellently and it really compliments this phone well.<br/><br/>Overall very satisfied with the purchase and I'll be using this phone for awhile. I highly recommend it to anyone who's looking for a cheap device off-contract or to anyone interested in trying Windows Phone 8.1 for themselves.
I bought this phone to use with a shared mobile plan AT&T; account.  Not the go phone account.  I don't know anything about go phone service or activation.  Worked perfectly...installed my sim card and started up.  The network recognized my sim and registered the phone on AT&T;'s network.<br/><br/>Screen Clarity: I would rate very good, not great.  Its slightly less sharp than my MotoG (which had a great screen), but for being a mid range to low/mid range phone it is very good.  Screen backgrounds look sharp and colors are accurate. Text is clear and easy to read.<br/><br/>Speed: Very fast.  Menus are as quick to move thru as my Nexus 4 and MotoG.  I have never experienced any lag.<br/><br/>Build Quality: The phone feels solid.  Light, but not cheap.  My wife and I like the different colors for the back covers (sold separately).  The build joints are better than my old Galaxy S3 (if that's saying much).  It's all plastic, but well put together.  I think the screen is Gorilla Glass 3.  Seems solid.....no scratches after using for a week.<br/><br/>OS:  To my understanding this is one of the first Windows 8.1 devices out.  I like the windows 8.1 OS.  I've used them all.....and it has to be one of the easiest phones I've ever used. The App Store does not have near the amount of apps as Android and iPhone, but all the basic apps I use are there.<br/><br/>If your looking for a no-contract alternative, good all around phone for email, light web browsing, texting and phone calls this is a good phone.  Battery life is good.  It lasts me a regular day.<br/><br/>I cannot talk about the camera......I never use them on phones.  There is no front facing camera on this phone so if you need a front camera I'd look elsewhere.<br/><br/>I love the Nokia music service.  It's free and is basically a Pandora type of service.  You can select the sort of music you like and it plays a playlist of those songs.  The app is already installed and works by opening the app (no registration that I can remember).<br/><br/>Overall a good basic phone.
As an hardcore android user, liking an Windows Phone is difficult! But this WP v8.1 running windows phone is really really impressive, specially at this price point! Allow me to enlighten you:<br/><br/>0. Performance: You need to use this phone to believe that, how a 512MB RAM phone can run soo smooth.<br/>1. Perfect form factor: The phone is not small, not big, I would say perfect. Very comfortable to use. No complaints about that.<br/>2. Display: 5 stars. One the best, bright & vivid display on a smart phone. There is no slider to adjust brightness. Only 3 settings toggles: "Low, Medium & High". I mostly keep it on 'Medium', sometimes on 'Low', but never on 'High'! [You can set those 3 levels on settings menu] Because its too bright :P. Very very good color production. I'd say about the level of AMOLED panels. And, you can also tweak display colors!<br/>3. Battery Life: 6 out of 5 stars. You do not have to worry about battery life, trust me! My settings are like this: GPS, Wifi, Mobile Data on 24/7. And I always get more than a day easily with moderate to high usage! It is because, lack of higher resolution, proximity sensor & aided by the OS itself.<br/>4. Camera: 5MP back camera quality is too good for a sub $50 phone! You can compare it with the camera of iPhone 4, I'm SERIOUS! It is that good! It does not have a front facing camera, meaning, you have to take selfie blindly, have to video chat on skype blindly (with the back camera) :-|.<br/>5. Call quality: Call quality of Nokia phones are legendary. No rating needed!<br/>6. Removable back cover: Means, you can always swap a new color for ~$7 & get a new look! Those covers are sturdy & good looking.<br/>7. Expandable storage: Supports upto 128GB of micro SD card! You can move apps to SD card & free the phone memory too!<br/>8. OS: Windows Phone 8.1 is GREAT. Its fluid, smooth & a pleasure to use. All the mainstream apps are available, except those google apps. But third party apps are there too full-fill those gaps.<br/>9. Capabilities:<br/>  -HERE Maps & Navigation: The best offline & free maps & navigation service from Nokia. This app is unbeatable. You can use this phone as a GPS Navigatior!!! Which is much more smarter than a Garmin or Tomtom device! Yes, you can use it as a sub $50 GPS device!<br/>  -Health & Fitness by MSN: An excellent fitness tracker, steps counter & much more! A very very good fitness app. I couldn't find a better or more reliable fitness app on android!<br/>  -Windows Phone 10 preview: Yes, you can install & experience the new WP 10 Preview on this phone! Its officially supported & will be upgraded to WP 10!<br/>  -Camera: Really great! 5MP may sounds low quality performance, but this can capture some very detailed photos! There are some 'Scanner' apps on store, you install one of those (eg. Handy Scanner) & use it as a document scanner!<br/>  -Multimedia device: Even if you don't use this as a phone, you can use it as a MP3 player or a very good video player!<br/>  -FM Radio: Which is a very rare thing this days, in a smartphone! & it works perfect!<br/><br/>Conclusion: Can you suggest me a device which can play music, movies, browse web, which can be used as an offline (without internet) navigation device & on top of that, can make phone calls! And all these under $50??? Answer is very simple & short: NO. If I use other android phone as my daily driver, I use this phone as a GPS navigator! It works sooo good & the long lasting battery is always a plus!<br/><br/>In the end, I highly recommend this phone as a daily driver or as a secondary phone or as GPS Navigation device or as a multimedia device (like an iPod!) :-).<br/><br/>UPDATED [05/14/2015]: Since, I'm not selling this phone anytime soon, I bought a rounded edge tempered glass screen protector, received it today. It is 'A MUST HAVE' accessory for this phone!!! The phone looks & feels more premium with it!!! Here is the link: <br/>
Great phone! I can't believe it's only $99. I ordered just to play around with the new Windows 8.1 and Cortana, but it has turned into my daily driver. Size is very similar to the iPhone 5, but it feels better in the hand. Pros: battery life is great so far. Screen is very good. Phone reception is great and speaker is very loud and clear. The only Con that I can find is that the screen doesn't seem to repel oil as much as I would like. Overall I am very impressed. I am buying two more for friends and family.
I broke my Lumia 920 screen and wanted to replace it with an Android or iOS device, but then most of them are ridiculously expensive.  And this Lumia 635 "gophone", I can just pop in my exisitng SIM card and started to use it right away.  It sync'd all my apps and settings automatically (it was surprising) too.<br/><br/>No 2-year contract to buy phones for the discount price, and if I get 2-year contract, I lose other discount.  At the end, either 2 year contract or not, almost it seems I have to pay the full price anyway.  These days cell phones for $500~$900 and replace every 2-3 years, and they don't last more than 2-3 years.  It doesn't make sense to me to buy highend phones.  This phone is affordable ($50) and very good quality.  It has limited memory (8GB), but adding 32GB SD card and I can run apps from the card easily.  So internal memory is not a problem, unlike other phones (iOS or Android).  And moving apps to SD card is very easy.<br/><br/>Before Windows Phone 8.1, the new UI is nice, but it lacked many features, but with 8.1, it's great.  I love WP interface.  I have both iOS and Android phones, and iPads, android tablets.  I use Mac, Windows and Linux as well.  iPhone battery lasts longest and very well built -- best quality, but way too expensive.  Android device problem is the memory.  Most of apps don't run from SD card so large internal memory is necessary which pushes up the price.<br/><br/>Lumia 635 battery lasts longer than Lumia 920, and it's very durable, and with the cheap case+screen protector I bought on Amazon(E-Time, $6 for case AND screen protector), it feels really durable.  Lumia 920 was very nice, but it was heavy, the metal case was slippery, and the battery didn't last long.<br/><br/>I really really like this phone and I'm extremely happy with it.<br/><br/>Downsides are:<br/>- no camera light.  I rarely used the light anyway, so I don't miss it much, except the fact that I could use it as a flash light.<br/>- no sensor for brightness.  You have to manually adjust the setting.  It's easy to do, and not too much hassle though.<br/>- no compass sensor.  Not an issue for me, and GPS works fine (GPS doesn't require compass sensor), but some apps may not work that requires compass.<br/>- no front facing camera.  I don't take selfies, but take photos of my kids, so this is not a problem.<br/><br/>When I purchased Lumia 920 about 2-3 years ago, there weren't too many apps, but now it has tons of great apps.  And most of "essential" apps like facebooks, linkedin, etc are all there and tons of games as well.<br/><br/>Compare to other phones, I love these three features (app specific):<br/>- Offline map.  Maps can be downloaded and can be used offline.  Very fast, and I don't have to worry about the connection or data usage.<br/>- Music app that I can download (offline music) and listen for free.  I can't select songs for the free music, but it's not a problem -- I can listen to billbaord chart or classical music collection.<br/>- Radio.  It has built-in FM radio.<br/><br/>Lumia 530 is even cheaper (but smaller screen), but it's $30.  Even w/o the phone service,  you can use it as a GPS device and emergency 911 call, and games, music, etc.<br/><br/>UPDATE: 2015-03-04<br/>I've been using it for a while, and here are some updates:<br/>- I wish the camera has higher resolution, but for this price, I guess it's ok.  I took many videos and photos of my kids.  They look fine on facebook/web, but it's not high resolution that you can print and frame it.<br/>- I did once needed a flash light, but I used the phone screen instead and it was bright enough for me at that time.  I should look for an app that make the front screen all white+bright to use it as flash light.  I remember iOS has such apps.<br/>- I don't know if it's the phone or career, a few times, the caller on the other end complained that my voice was choppy.<br/>- I have iOS headset with mic -- the mic didn't work with Lumia 920, but it works with this phone.
I got interested in the Windows Phone platform earlier in the year when I read great reviews of the Nokia Lumia 520 and read rumors about the changes in the upcoming WP 8.1.  I picked up a 520 on the cheap to use as a backup phone, and just to see what the excitement was all about. It took months from the time I got my 520 to upgrade t0 8.1, but when it did, I was very impressed.  There were only about two apps I missed when I switched over to the 520 full time from a Nexus 4--I'm a sucker for an underdog.  Anyway, the 4" screen was a little cramped for my large hands, so when the 635 came out with a 4.5" screen, I didn't hesitate to make the move to it.<br/><br/>The transition from the 520 was fast and virtually seamless, involving restoring my apps and contacts from the cloud to the new phone with the push of a button.  After the apps updated from the store, it was good to go.  It even kept my wallpaper selection.  The performance bump from the quad-core processor is noticeable.  Apps load fast and screen response is smooth.<br/><br/>When other smart phone makers are pushing out more and more expensive offerings, I think Microsoft is playing a very smart gambit by hitting the other end of the scale with an excellent phone at a fantastic price.  Sure, it lacks a front facing camera, which doesn't bother me as much as missing a flash.  But I'm OK with that, since I don't shoot a lot of low light pictures anyway, and the rest of the package more than makes up for a couple of cost cutting deficiencies.<br/><br/>I've had several smartphones over the years, from cheap entry level models from Huawei and ZTE to higher end pieces from HTC to an iPhone and most recently the LG/Google Nexus 4.  So far, I stack the quality of the 635 up there with the best I've used.  If you're ready for something new, I don't think you'll be disappointed with the 635.  Great phone, great OS, great price.
I've been with Android for a long time. I am loving windows 8.1 OS . I was so skeptical because windows is known for crashing but this phone OS is .about the Nokia. I would've expected to pay a lot more for these features on this phone. The screen is so clear and details are perfect. Wish it had a flash  for the camera. I am finding better game apps with windows OS as well. I hope windows OS survives the OS wars going on now.
If you want a phone,I think it will be good choice,But if you want a good smart phone,you must think about something more,WP have a few APPs,and the quality of the APPs is so poor!
Is it worth the sub-$100 price of admission? Oh yes. Sure it's missing a few features, but I am not complaining because it was $99. For a brand new 4G-LTE Windows 8.1 device. WIth Cortana.<br/><br/>It's fast. Cortana is great. It's customizable. It has all the apps I need. It's well built. It's a good phone. No regrets.<br/><br/>The only negative I can really give it, is that there is no dedicated voice-to-text button on the keyboard like in Android. You can only use voice-to-text when doing a web search, texting or writing an email. I need it built into the keyboard to use with any app. So, that's frustrating, but maybe the Windows team will add that feature on the next major update.
I bought three of these for the kids. Where else can you get a smart phone for 100 bucks. Can't beat it. The only drawback is the camera but none of my kids are into picture taking. They use it for everything.  I wanted to upgrade their  messaging phones without signing up for a two year contract or paying $400-500 per phone. I picked these up and added them to my ATT account without any trouble. I switched to the family share plan and knocked my phone bill from $215 to $149 month.
One of the best entry Windows Phones. Period. I own HTC 8X, Lumia 520, 1020, and my wife has 925. Lumia 520 is a great phone, no doubt. But Lumia 635 (I bought it because it was on sale for $39.99) is an incredible value for those who do not want premium phone and do not take selfies. Since there are already many excellent reviews, I just want to add my two cents:<br/><br/>1. FAST. While it comes with 512MB RAM, because it is a QUAD core, it is much much faster than Lumia 520. I compared with my HTC 8X and most of the apps open at the same time, and the web experience was actually slightly faster than 8X to my surprise! So you will not be disappointed. L635 comes with LTE speed so it is pretty fast where there is no WiFi available. See [Hint 2] below for enabling LTE.<br/>2. BATTERY LIFE. I used it for almost 2 days. email, texts, few calls, and some web browsing lasted me 2 days. But I set the brightness to "LOW" and turned off the apps that work in the background.<br/>3. DISPLAY. Certainly at this price range, I do not expect to compete with HTC 8X, but it is decent. Gorilla glass 3 is a huge bonus! I dropped the phone from waste high to the concrete floor in gas station, the back cover popped out, but the screen was not cracked, but the screen protector was scratched. So the Gorilla glass 3 is definitely strong! Also, at least personally, setting the background "light" instead of "dark" helped to improve its display. Perhaps you should try it [settings -> start+theme -> background -> select "light"]<br/>4. BRIGHTNESS. Now it does not have "automatic brightness sensor" like Lumia 520, but you can control the brightness of each of "low," "medium," and "high" setting. Now if you see that your "low" setting is too low for you but "medium" is a little too bright, then you can control the brightness of "low" setting to make it brighter. Adjust it accordingly [Settings -> display -> Brightness profile -> click "adjust" -> move the bar at "low level (currently selected)."]<br/>5. SOUND. Both calls and music sound are average. They are  clear, but not as clear or rich as 8X or 925. But for a budget phone, this is normal.<br/><br/>[HINT: If dropped, the back cover of the phone will pop out even if you have the case put on. To prevent this, use DOUBLE-SIDED scotch tape inside the cover. It will prevent the cover from popping out when dropped. But make sure that you do not cover the sensors or speakers. I put the tape right below the battery and above the speaker].<br/><br/>[HINT 2: Enabling LTE. Initially, you will only see 4G speed, but make a call to your friend or a family member from your L635 and speak on the phone for 10 minutes, then within few hours, you will see LTE signal. Additionally, your visual voicemail (vvm) will be enabled - if you have the plan for it].<br/><br/>All in all, this is a great entry phone (or backup phone) for those who just want basic smartphone. But if you know Windows Phone, the OS does so much more. It is dependable OS, and at the end of the day, that's what we all want. And I have been using L635 as my daily driver. Highly recommended!
I got this phone when at&t; forced me to upgrade when they were going to 4G LTE. It replaced my old Nokia 2610 that I got when I signed up for an AT&T; contract years ago. I can't afford to buy a new cellphone every time I turn around.<br/><br/>The Nokia Lumina 635 is my second Cellphone and my first smart phone. It's great for phone calls, texting and occasional web surfing.<br/>The sound is great.  I have bad hearing. It is loud enough for me to hear from it. I like to use the speaker when I make calls also. The speaker is 100 times better than my old cellphone's speaker.<br/>Some people complain that it doesn't have a camera on the front for selfies, I got it for phone calls and Texting not for taking selfies.<br/>Another complaint is that it is the camera is 5mp. The pictures from this phone are great as it is. If I wanted to take pictures with a higher mp rate I'd use my camera. The pictures it does take are very good. I can take pictures of stuff when I need to email them to someone.<br/>It does eat up power if you use it a lot like playing games. It does have a number of apps you can get from the Store. The only app I got was WeatherBug because that is the best weather app out there IMHO.<br/>For someone that just wants and needs a really good basic phone that is under $100 it doesn't get any better than Nokia Lumina 635. It's a vast improvement over my old Nokia 2610 in every way. It was like going from a VW bug to a Ferrari to me.<br/><br/>Update on Jan 7, 2015: The charger that came with the phone stopped charging the phone. The end that plugs into the phone had a wire break. I ordered a new and Sturdier charger from amazon.com. I would recommend getting a spare charger That is not made by nokia because they are flimsy. I still think this is a five star phone even with the poor quality charger that came with the phone.
I got this phone the other day and I am liking it so far. It is my FIRST Windows phone and I was scared going in since I have been on Android for close to 5 years now but the transition has been pretty smooth. The app selection is OK and I hope it gets better since it doesn't have certain apps I used daily. The battery can get me thru the whole day (I am not a heavy user) and I can drive roughly an hour with the GPS and go from 100% to about 81% (While playing music at the same time) by the end of the trip. The camera is decent... it's not the best out there, but for the price it's good. The build feels solid in my hands and the display isn't bad either.<br/><br/>This part is for the ones wondering about trying windows<br/><br/>On the device the operating system has been smooth for me so far. Switching between a game to a text is quick and just takes a second or so to start the game again. The live tiles are nice and everything is right where you need it. Cortana is interesting and the fact that it's in beta and can at times go toe to toe against Siri and Google Now is a good sign. The phone has a "Drive" mode and by that I mean you can connect it to your cars Bluetooth and it'll ask if you want to go in Drive mode and if you tap yes, it will ask "Messaged received from ___, would you like to hear it?" and if you say yes it will read the text and ask if you want to respond and it'll type up what you say and ask if it's alright or not and it'll send the text without you even touching the phone and the same goes with a call. For the price I would say try it and give Windows a shot. It's simple like Apples OS and that's really the best example I can give.
I did not expect too much from this phone given the price. WRONG! This is by far the best phone I have used to date and I have gone through a long line of very expensive phones. The build quality is very solid and the perfect size and shape. The Windows 8.1 OS is very fast, much more so than any Android phone I have tried. Over the years I have found Android very irritating to use and Windows is a simple pleasure to use. Nothing fancy, it just works flawlessly. The phone runs at LTE speed on AT&T; and like I said, it is fast, more so than a comparable or higher processor equipped Android device.<br/><br/>Specs are nice and useful as a guideline but sometimes they don't tell the whole story. This Lumia is consistently snappier and faster than my wifes Galaxy S5 and though she loves all the Apps on her phone, I use Office a lot and can even download Scrivener files from the cloud and edit them on this phone then sync back to the cloud seamlessly.<br/><br/>If you like to fiddle around then Android might win points, but if you want a phone that is fast and straight to the point when it comes to real productivity then this is about the best you can find at any price....and at $79 you don't need to coddle this phone although it can certainly take a fe hard knocks.
I have to say that I wasn't expecting such a nice quality phone having been an iPhone user for the past few years.  This phone is great though!  It has a nice screen, is quick and responsive, and battery life seems better than my iPhone 5.  Considering the cost difference between the two, the Lumia is much better.  While the Microsoft Store doesn't have all the apps like Apple, you can likely get by - especially due to the integration of Microsoft Office and OneDrive with the phone.  And the best part is I can still use it with my AT&T; GoPhone 10 cents per minute voice only plan.  My old GoPhone had a standard SIM card, and when I received this phone with a Micro SIM card, I just called AT&T; GoPhone support and they moved by balance right over to the new SIM over the phone.  No trip to the store needed!  Now I have a smart phone that costs 10 cents per minute for voice calls, has no cell data access (which costs too much anyway), and the phone gets all the data it needs from my home wi-fi or other access points as needed.  Overall, it's a great phone at an incredible purchase price and even better monthly recurring price if you're a light cell phone user.
This is an absolutely  AMAZING phone.<br/><br/>First things first... As other people have said... If you want the apps of Google Play and Apple, DO NOT get this phone.<br/><br/>Now that we are past that, this phone is great!  I love Win 8.1.  I had android before and Win 8.1 is so much cleaner, faster, and more responsive.  I love the tiles of 8.1.  It just makes it a great experience.<br/><br/>Battery life has been EXCEPTIONAL.  I use my phone for everything and by the end of the night I have 30-40% left.  AMAZING!<br/><br/>If you don't care about having all the apps, get this phone.  It still has a lot of apps, but not all the games you might be used to.<br/><br/>Loving this phone!  I paid $99, but I just saw it for $80 the other day.  If that's the case, I don't think ANYONE could find a better phone.
Nokia really got it down with their line of budget phones, starting with the 520 phone, their best-selling phone to date. So what's all the hoopla about a sub-$100 Windows phone? Well, let's see if we can address that question well enough to make a positive argument for acquiring one (or ditching the thought).<br/><br/>First, let's preface this review by stating upfront that the Lumia 635 is a budget phone on steroids. There is no chance of mistaking this phone as more than that. If you are looking for a mid or high-end Windows phone, please look into the other phones in the Lumia line, such as mid-end 735, or high-end 1525 if you are into expensive phones, whatever your reason. But if your expectations are reasonable as to what to expect for a low-end phone, then the Lumia 635 will not only please you, but will surprize you as well, as it does pack a mighty punch for what you pay to own this baby. Let's get to the phone and see what we can uncover.<br/><br/>At under $129, on the T-Mobile carrier (also available on AT&T;) this phone simply rocks for the price. The 635 boasts a screen with Corning's Gorilla Glass 3, which will protect the screen from cracking under normal ground-drops. Its ClearBlack and IPS 4.5 inch screen gives a good screen experience, even when used in bright outdoor situations, something its predecessor, the 521, lacked.<br/><br/>Its live-tiles are eye-candy and can be set to small to large tiles, depending on the app you pin to the start screen.<br/>The 635 comes with the latest incarnation of the Windows Phone operating system, 8.1, and brings Cortana, the chatty assistant, along with it, as well as other under-the-hood improvements that make for a fluid experience that is a pleasure to interact with. I found no screen lag when swiping across screens, and most of the applications launched quickly without the slightest struggle, even with just 512MB of RAM. It appears the system is optimized to do its job well on that. I have to agree. It comes with 8GB of on-board storage of which just slightly over 5GB is usable. You can supplement the memory capacity with up to a 128GB card for storage of your music and movies. This is a welcome addition. Gone are the days when memory was confined to what came with your phone.<br/><br/>The back camera is a decent 5mp shooter that also shoots 720p videos at 30 frames a second, resulting in clear video. As there is only one camera, no Skyping; but for a budget phone with the specs of the 635, concessions had to be made, and this one is an acceptable omission, as is the camera button. But touching anywhere on the screen in camera-mode makes for a steadier shot.<br/><br/>Screen real-estate is a generous 4.5" with pull down action-center, allowing you to check email and make changes to certain settings without having to go into settings menu. Text was clear and pictures popped with deep blacks and acceptable whites. Good job, Nokia!<br/><br/>Videos played smoothly with no lag and were crisp, reproducing colors far better than similarly-priced phones and some phones costing much more.<br/><br/>Youtube videos were a pleasant experience that actually surprised me. Audio was another pleasant plus: it was louder than I would have anticipated for a low-end phone, and there was no shrilling, even at the highest volume level; it was quite a good experience on par with higher-end phones.<br/><br/>Another welcome feature is Wifi calling. This phone can hand-off to Wifi when your carrier signal is weak, or you can just use Wifi when you don't have a signal in areas your carrier doesn't do well in. Calling on both Wifi and carrier signal is clear and loud. There were no sound-drops or call-drops, a fine addition to the Lumia experience.<br/><br/>Battery life is exceptionally long, given its 1485-mAh battery. With normal use of email, music and a few videos, I can go 5 days without charging! It has an extended talk-time and long standby time. This is not usually found on phones in the price range. The battery-saver option and shutting down of apps that run in the background can further extended battery time.<br/>The phone's design is a fresh-looking modern piece, and its back cover can be switched to various eye-pleasing colors. It has a nice feel in the hand and doesn't have that cheap quality associated with other budget phones.<br/><br/>The chatty digital assistant, Cortana, beats Siri (Apple) by a mile. She does all your bidding from launching a song or applications to making appointments, and much more. You will find Cortana to be the go-to for daily needs.<br/><br/>Other notable inclusions: 4G LTE, a very surprising addition; quad-core engine for fast, seamless launching; internet sharing that allows you to use your phone as a hotspot; Office, OneNote and OneDrive. Actually, you would be hard-pressed to find something not available for work. To see what Microsoft/Nokia has to offer, peruse their lines at:<br/>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/phones/all/<br/>.<br/>In summary:<br/>My month with the 635 has been a pleasant one. It is still difficult for me to consider that this phone is a low-end model in comparison to phones costing up to 10 times the cost. I cannot, in good conscience, qualify the expenditure of hundreds of dollars for a phone. This phone has features the high-end phones have and more! Yes, some concessions had to be made in order to keep the price low, but for the average user who can do without Skype or selfies and other frivolous bling, you'd have a difficult time in choosing a Windows phone with this kind of bang for what you pay.<br/><br/>If you are content with a phone that gives the basics and more, and does it exceedingly well, you can't go wrong with the Lumia 635. It is my pick for best-featured Windows phone for the price.<br/>Note: Its predecessor, the 521, is similarly decked, save for 4G LTE and ClearBlack technology. A few other minor differences exists, but the 521 can be bought at around $60 now. Most will find the 521 a great buy, so you have the choice of spending a little more, or coming in at a bargain-basement pricing for the 521. Either one is a great phone, but if you can, spend the little extra for the 635.
Firstly: Wow! I don't think I had low expectations even considering the low prices at Amazon and that's because, looking at the Reviews here and the apparent selling out on Amazon (and other online places), I guessed a very good phone. But would it be a 'very good phone for the price' or a 'very good phone' on its own? The answer to that is a resounding extremely good phone for the price and a very good phone on its own.<br/><br/>Anyway is my Review:<br/>1) Got it delivered yesterday from Amazon. I put in my postpaid/contract Nokia Lumia 920's SIM inside. The phone worked right away--no APN changes.<br/>2) Logged into Windows Live and, in about 90 minutes, all my 'apps' were transferred/install from Lumia 920 to this Lumia 635. That ate up most of my 8 gb storage though--but I can and will get an SD card.<br/>3) Downloaded Nokia maps (free) for the US Southeast states and tested 'offline' navigation by going to a place 7 miles from the house. While the experience was not 100% Garmin-like it was more than adequate: Re-routing, over-speed alerts, and voice-based navigation all worked to pin-point perfection through quite a circuitous route I deliberately took. This phone can be your completely FREE GPS device if you use Wifi to download maps and don't have any cell plan.<br/>4) The battery lasted hours into late night until I plugged it in before going to bed. And at this time, at work, the battery drain is about 15% after moderate web usage, text etc--about 5 hours of usage so far.<br/>5) Camera quality is not too bad--***see my uploaded picture**. I am going to miss the LED flash of Nokia 920 though.<br/>6) AT&T;'s LTE is working fine--I have used speedtest 'app' to record both upload/download speeds of 17mbps!!<br/>7) Call quality is adequate. Speakers to play music is adequate.<br/>8) Windows Phone 8.1 is a great OS! I am very impressed by the performance on such a low-end hardware and am very impressed that the 'settings' from my Nokia Lumia 920's faithfully duplicating on this new phone.<br/><br/>In short, despite the phone's shortcomings (no LED, no front facing camera, and relatively fewer 'apps') this phone can be your phone, your camera, your GPS device, your alarm clock, your wifi hotspot, your mp3 and video player, and with literally hundreds of thousands of 'apps' you will find plenty of ways to make other uses from this phone.<br/><br/>I really can't say there are any 'negatives' about this phone! I may not replace my $480 Nokia Lumia 920 because of the camera-quality difference but this phone is a stronger contender to become my main, almost 'disposable' but extremely useful electronic Swiss Army Knife!<br/>**Update 15 Dec. 2014** Still using and loving this phone. In fact, just ordered another one for my wife to replace her Lumia 520 as her Christmas Present!**
I couldn't resist buying this phone when I saw it available for $39.99. To put things in perspective, I am a long time Windows Phone and Nokia user. I had a Nokia Lumia 920 and my wife uses a Nokia Lumia 520 and I was planning to give her a mini upgrade.<br/><br/>This phone can do 90% of the things that the most expensive ones can do, and do it well, at 1/10th the cost!!!!. If you are an AT&T; post paid customer, you can save a lot of money on your plan by bringing your own device instead of signing a 2 year contract. By spending less than $100 on this phone, you could save around $250-$300 on your plan over a 2 year period. You don't have to worry about buying expensive protection or insurance either. If it breaks, just buy another one.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Cost conscious, New to smartphone, light users, kids and youth, seniors, people who are looking for a simple user friendly interface, normal people who want to use their phones to make calls, check emails, access internet, listen to music, those who use phone as a GPS etc.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: Photo enthusiasts, too much into apps, heavy gamers, people who use phone as a status symbol, heavy users<br/><br/>Hardware:<br/>1. Very nice screen for the price, great battery life, loud speaker, works well with WiFi<br/>2. The GPS works well and you can download maps to your phone for the navigation and mapping app. That means you don't have to burn your data plan as with other OSes, also you will not be without a map if there is no coverage.<br/>3. The camera is OK for daytime use. The lack of flash will limit its use in low light and night time photography.<br/>4. There is no front facing camera, so if you are into selfies, you better be a gymnast or ask someone else to do it for you. Also, this will limit video calling using Skype.<br/>5. If you are coming from a higher end Nokia, you will miss the Glance feature, but for most people reading this, who are coming from other OS, you probably have no clue what I am talking about. (This is a unique and cool feature of higher end Lumias.)<br/>6. It paired nicely with my FitBit One using Bluetooth.<br/>7. It comes with 4G LTE capability, which provides lightning fast internet wherever you go. It also connects to AT&T; WiFi hotspots where available.<br/><br/>Software:<br/>1. Windows Phone OS is the smoothest operating system out there, and it outperforms Android phones especially on lower end hardware like this phone. No lags, no freezes, no crashes. You will hardly need a restart ever.<br/>2. The keyboard on Windows Phones is the best in the business, based on my experience. The touch accuracy along with the amazing word prediction engine, makes typing on this keyboard a breeze.<br/>3. It is a well documented fact that Windows Phone OS have less choices in the app store compared to Android or iOS. If you are too much into apps, I wouldn't recommend this phone. Having said that, most commonly used apps are available. I think this problem would go away in the future versions, as Microsoft is going to have one integrated OS across all devices. If you are wondering if a specific app is available, you can do your research at the Windows Phone store from your computer.<br/>4. Cortana personal assistant is amazing. She understands natural human commands and will learn from your favorites and usage patterns.<br/><br/>****Edit: After few days of use, one thing I wanted to add is that this phone is a finger print magnet, especially the screen. Get a good screen protector., if you like.
Nokia continues to make great smart phones at extremely affordable prices. The Nokia 635 is the best phone available with no contract price under $250. It's only competition is the Moto G LTE which costs twice as much as the 635. The camera is better than the Moto G.<br/>Nokia remains one more of the only companies putting a real GPS in their phones with a separate GPS radio. This means the GPS will function in the middle of no where without a cellular connection. Most phones require a data connection to use the GPS. Just make sure to download maps for the area you intend to be in before you travel if the area has no cellular coverage. If you want a larger phone, the Nokia 1320 is amazing and only $179 on Cricket. It grassroots a 6" screen and slightly better specs. This phone is not unlocked. ATT will unlock the phone after a certain period of time. The phone will work on ATT MVNOs without unlocking. All the other features have been adequately covered in the other reviews.
This review doesn't reflect anything much about the Windows Phone OS. I personally love it, but it certainly isn't for everyone. If you are not familiar with Windows Phone, you should probably watch a video that goes over its interface and such before purchasing a Windows Phone device to see if its right for you. A great article that does this can be found on Windows Phone Central (http://www.wpcentral.com/windows-phone-81-review). My review primarily discusses the hardware as opposed to the OS.<br/><br/>This phone is effectively the "new" Lumia 520 (released last year). It is extremely inexpensive but has numerous improvements over the 520 from last year. The major improvements are the processor, the wireless radio, and the screen. With the updated Snapdragon 400, the Lumia 635 is smoother and more responsive than the 520. Besides the occasional loading screen on heavier apps (which I tend to blame on the 512 MB of RAM), I would say it runs as older flagships like the Lumia 920. It runs games very smoothly, such as Wordament (the greatest game ever! haha).<br/><br/>This speediness is augmented by the fact that the 635 has LTE capabilities, making it probably the least expensive phone that has AT&T; LTE. If your phone doesn't support LTE (or you don't live in an area that has it) then you may not appreciate this, but here in the greater Denver area AT&Ts; LTE is impressive. It makes pulling up web pages and updating content in apps much snappier than just standard HSPA+ speeds the 520 offered.<br/><br/>The screen is also beautiful for a budget device. While not HD (what do you expect for $100?), it does have the latest Gorilla Glass 3 for great scratch resistance. It also has Nokia's ClearBlack display meaning that the screen basically has an extra polarized layer to improve visibility regardless of the lighting situation. It makes for easier viewing in sunlight. It also makes the colors much richer and blacks much deeper than the 520 (which had fairly washed out colors).<br/><br/>Of course there are some downers with the new phone. We lose the two-stage physical camera button, which is a real pity. That is something that I feel all phones should have, but alas. It still only has 512 MB of RAM. This isn't a dealbreaker for casual smartphone users, but if you are a heavy smartphone gamer you shouldn't buy this phone... or any other budget phone for that matter. Some apps have a 1GB minimum requirement which this phone does not fulfill, but almost all of them are games. There still is no front facing camera. I don't care about this, but some people do. The rear camera isn't that great either. There are a few sensors also lost on this phone like the proximity and ambient light sensors. Overall you will likely not notice a super difference with the proximity sensor as they work around that well. The missing ambient light sensor can be a downer at times, but with the new Action Center in Windows Phone 8.1, you can easily toggle between three preset brightness settings. The medium one works for most situations.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1) Super responsive despite budget specs<br/>2) MicroSD for tons of expandability<br/>3) Super inexpensive<br/>4) LTE speeds<br/>5) ClearBlack display with Gorilla Glass 3 is very nice for a budget phone<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1) Camera is pretty bad (plus it doesn't have flash)<br/>2) No front facing camera<br/>3) Lost the hardware camera button<br/>4) Occasional loading screens on heavy apps<br/>5) Some apps require 1GB of RAM and will not install (some games)<br/><br/>All in all, the phone isn't spectacular, but you aren't paying for a spectacular phone are you? This phone has great specs for the price, but due to the price you are going to have some features cut. You simply need to evaluate if this device would fit in with your usage habits. If you are a heavy smartphone gamer or have a selfie fetish, you obviously won't want this phone. If you are a casual smartphone user that likes phones that function well, but don't require you to sell a kidney to buy it off-contract, this would probably meet most of your needs.
This phone cost about $20 more than the avail 2, and some other phones. The quality of this is like going from a regular car to a Cadillac.It works so easy,and has far more features,than one would want,and more than you'd expect from a phone at this price.Try it, you might like it!
Nokia really got it down with their line of budget phones, starting with the 520 phone, their best-selling phone to date.  So what's all the hoopla about a sub-$100 Windows phone?  Well, let's see if we can address that question well enough to make a positive argument for acquiring one (or ditching the thought).<br/><br/>First, let's preface this review by stating upfront that the Lumia 635 is a budget phone on steroids. There is no chance of mistaking this phone as more than that.  If you are looking for a mid or high-end Windows phone, please look into the other phones in the Lumia line, such as mid-end 735, or high-end 1525 if you are into expensive phones, whatever your reason.  But if your expectations are reasonable as to what to expect for a low-end phone, then the Lumia 635 will not only please you, but will surprize you as well, as it does pack a mighty punch for what you pay to own this baby.  Let's get to the phone and see what we can uncover.<br/><br/>At under $129, on the T-Mobile carrier (also available on AT&T;) this phone simply rocks for the price.  The 635 boasts a screen with Corning's Gorilla Glass 3, which will protect the screen from cracking under normal ground-drops. Its ClearBlack and IPS 4.5 inch screen gives a good screen experience, even when used in bright outdoor situations, something its predecessor, the 521, lacked.<br/><br/>Its live-tiles are eye-candy and can be set to small to large tiles, depending on the app you pin to the start screen.<br/>The 635 comes with the latest incarnation of the Windows Phone operating system, 8.1, and brings Cortana, the chatty assistant, along with it, as well as other under-the-hood improvements that make for a fluid experience that is a pleasure to interact with. I found no screen lag when swiping across screens, and most of the applications launched quickly without the slightest struggle, even with just 512MB of RAM.  It appears the system is optimized to do its job well on that. I have to agree. It comes with 8GB of on-board storage of which just slightly over 5GB is usable. You can supplement the memory capacity with up to a 128GB card for storage of your music and movies. This is a welcome addition. Gone are the days when memory was confined to what came with your phone.<br/><br/>The back camera is a decent 5mp shooter that also shoots 720p videos at 30 frames a second, resulting in clear video.  As there is only one camera, no Skyping; but for a budget phone with the specs of the 635, concessions had to be made, and this one is an acceptable omission, as is the camera button. But touching anywhere on the screen in camera-mode makes for a steadier shot.<br/><br/>Screen real-estate is a generous 4.5" with pull down action-center, allowing you to check email and make changes to certain settings without having to go into settings menu.  Text was clear and pictures popped with deep blacks and acceptable whites.  Good job, Nokia!<br/><br/>Videos played smoothly with no lag and were crisp, reproducing colors far better than similarly-priced phones and some phones costing much more.<br/><br/>Youtube videos were a pleasant experience that actually surprised me. Audio was another pleasant plus: it was louder than I would have anticipated for a low-end phone, and there was no shrilling, even at the highest volume level; it was quite a good experience on par with higher-end phones.<br/><br/>Another welcome feature is Wifi calling.  This phone can hand-off to Wifi when your carrier signal is weak, or you can just use Wifi when you don't have a signal in areas your carrier doesn't do well in. Calling on both Wifi and carrier signal is clear and loud. There were no sound-drops or call-drops, a fine addition to the Lumia experience.<br/><br/>Battery life is exceptionally long, given its 1485-mAh battery.  With normal use of email, music and a few videos, I can go 5 days without charging!  It has an extended talk-time and long standby time.  This is not usually found on phones in the price range.  The battery-saver option and shutting down of apps that run in the background can further extended battery time.<br/>The phone's design is a fresh-looking modern piece, and its back cover can be switched to various eye-pleasing colors. It has a nice feel in the hand and doesn't have that cheap quality associated with other budget phones.<br/><br/>The chatty digital assistant, Cortana, beats Siri (Apple) by a mile. She does all your bidding from launching a song or applications to making appointments, and much more.  You will find Cortana to be the go-to for daily needs.<br/><br/>Other notable inclusions: 4G LTE, a very surprising addition; quad-core engine for fast, seamless launching; internet sharing that allows you to use your phone as a hotspot; Office, OneNote and OneDrive.  Actually, you would be hard-pressed to find something not available for work.  To see what Microsoft/Nokia has to offer, peruse their lines at:<br/>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/phones/all/<br/>.<br/>In summary:<br/>My month with the 635 has been a pleasant one. It is still difficult for me to consider that this phone is a low-end model in comparison to phones costing up to 10 times the cost.  I cannot, in good conscience, qualify the expenditure of hundreds of dollars for a phone.  This phone has features the high-end phones have and more!  Yes, some concessions had to be made in order to keep the price low, but for the average user who can do without Skype or selfies and other frivolous bling, you'd have a difficult time in choosing a Windows phone with this kind of bang for what you pay.<br/><br/>If you are content with a phone that gives the basics and more, and does it exceedingly  well, you can't go wrong with the Lumia 635.  It is my pick for best-featured Windows phone for the price.<br/>Note: Its predecessor, the 521, is similarly decked, save for 4G LTE and ClearBlack technology. A few other minor differences exists, but the 521 can be bought at around $60 now.  Most will find the 521 a great buy, so you have the choice of spending a little more, or coming in at a bargain-basement pricing for the 521. Either one is a great phone, but if you can, spend the little extra for the 635.<br/><br/>B-t-w: The 635 actually can take selfies, with an app for that purpose, but you just can't see your pose. The apps beeps when it detects faces and shoots automatically.  As far as Skyping, you can if you stand in front of a mirror so your Skype partner can view you. Even without the mirror, you can see your partner and your partner can hear you. Of course, teens will find the omission of a front-facing camera a deal-breaker.  But you, adult, won't mind.  Enjoy!
I am a novice smartphone user, this is my first one. I am 60 years old and have been fighting upgrading because I liked my little qwerty pad cheap phone, and I feel electronically challenged to say the least, but when my old phone became unreliable I decided I had to make the switch to a better phone. I was hesitant because I had never used a touchscreen before, and felt dumb about it.<br/><br/>Man was I wrong! This phone is awesome and was not expensive. The features are easy to learn and use, and the sound quality is great! I am so glad I made the switch. I recommend this phone to anyone who is thinking about an inexpensive smartphone and needs for it to be easy to learn the features.<br/><br/>It does it all at a lower cost!
This is my first smartphone. I've never been that interested in Android and refuse to pay the "Apple Tax" just for the bragging rights to owning an Apple iPhone. However, Windows Phone looked like something I'd like to use. I wasn't wrong. I ordered this Nokia Lumia 635 based on a combination of hardware/software, good reviews, and price (since this was my first outing with a smartphone I didn't want to spend too much and find I didn't really use it for anything else than making calls). I was happily surprised when it got it. First, the Nokia didn't feel cheap like some inexpensive phones. Setup was a breeze and within minutes I was all set up. The phone is fast, has great call quality, and having wi-fi in addition to 4G LTE means around the home I can use my wireless wi-fi connection to connect to the internet so that I I can reserve my data plan for when I'm away from home. Though I haven't used the Metro/Modern Start page on my Windows 8.1 desktop (hated it there), I find I really love it on my Windows Phone (and on the tablets I've tried). For me it's been very intuitive, i only had to resort to the user's manual a couple of times. But the 'Crown Jewel' of Windows Phone 8.1 is CORTANA, the voice assist agent. I've used it several times and even with my bastardized Texas/South Arkansas 'twang', Cortana was 100% accurate on every request, from local restaurants and movie listings to providing answers on using the phone itself. I can tell that Cortana and I are going to be best friends before long and this is one phone feature that I wouldn't mind seeing Microsoft include on the next version of Windows, Windows 10, next year. Overall, I would have no qualms recommending this phone to fiends and family as long as they are aware of a few things:  1) it does not have a rear-facing camera so if you're into posting selfies of yourself, you'll want to look elsewhere; 2) it has only 512MB of internal memory instead of the 1GB more expensive phones have. This might be a consideration if you like to run a lot of apps at the same time but so far I haven't run into any problems; 3) internal storage total is 8GB but that number is reduced by the operating system and apps. However, this Nokia will let you add a micro-SD card with storage up to an additional 128GB so if you like to carry a lot of music, photos, or video, you'll want to invest in one of these cards. Other than that, this is a great starter phone in the Windows Phone family if you're on the fence as to whether you would like WP over Android, iOS, or Blackberry, or if you don't feel the need for the high-end features of more expensive phones. As for me, I'm a convert to Windows Phones!
I got this as an upgrade to my Lumia 520 and I'm very, very happy with the upgrade.<br/><br/>For 49.00, this thing was a steal. I'm very happy with the feel of the glass, the side buttons and the overall redesign of the case. Although I liked the overall feel of the 520, since it was a bit smaller, the larger screen size is a nice trade off.<br/><br/>The speaker, when playing music, is (to me) much louder than my old phone. And, with the quad core there is very little lag when opening a new application or having multiple apps open. That was the major problem that I was having with my 520, I had to close out apps just to run Pandora or Netflix without lag. This phone, no issues. The camera is as good as the 520, so not amazing but it does the job, and call quality is fine.<br/><br/>The only major issue I've been having is when i'm on call and, the screen will kick on unless the phone is flush against my face. I suppose the sensor that turns off the screen is the cause, but yea. I just hit the lock key and it the screen stays black. It's a minor inconvenience and not every phone may have that problem.<br/><br/>As always, the App market for Windows is very, very limited. But, that's not that big of a deal for me. If you're looking to buy a windows phone and are coming from Apple or Android, I would heed the reviews and maybe steer clear. The market place is very limited and if that's a deal killer for you, avoid Windows phones. However, if you're looking for a very cheap, very solid phone I would consider this over an entry level android.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a good phone. The price is stupid low, and you get a lot more than what you paid for. I didn't regret my 520, it was worth a lot more than what I paid for it and so far the 635 is looking to be a nice upgrade.
I have no experience with smart phones, this one is my first, but I have had a couple Android tablets, so I am basing my thoughts/opinions here on the two. Simply put, no matter what I am VERY impressed with the Lumia 635!!!! :)<br/><br/>I like everything about it, even the touch screen keyboard that I'm finally learning to use correctly (LOL), as my last phone had a slider keyboard that I liked VERY much. But, I also discovered (I hate reading manuals, and feel jumping in and playing with the phone works best for me) I can TALK my text messages in, WOW!!! Too cool! So between the words that pop up as I type a text, and being able to use my voice for text, I think I'm over the keyboard break up ;)<br/><br/>I am like a kid with an expensive new toy when using this phone, but it's not expensive, so maybe the "wow factor" is a bit over rated? Dunno...... ;)<br/><br/>I guess I kind of expected some lag & drag like the Android tablet I had, but there is really none to speak of! This phone is VERY fluid, screens roll by like a summer breeze! Considering there is only 512MB RAM, I am amazed!<br/><br/>I have installed a few dozen apps with absolutely no problem, have used same with absolutely no problem, and keep discovering new and cool features every day, and it's been a week since I got it!!!!! :)<br/><br/>I plan to buy another one VERY soon, so no matter what I'll have this phone for the next few years!!! OH! And for what it's worth, the 635 has all the features I personally want, and doesn't have the features I don't want, WIN WIN 4 ME!!!! YEY!!!!!! :)<br/><br/>(I forgot to mention that I seem to be having problems with video, Netflix in particular, but like I said, I'm still learning. I'm not sure it is the phone, I need to play around some more!!!)
bougfht 2 for college age daughters who 'needed' (according to current trends, not my daughter's themselves) smart phones for college; SO MUCH cheaper than iPhones ( and we tend to be Mac people) and fewer glitches, according to my oldest girl who has an iPhone..... reasonable price, performs as needed.
I swapped the SIM out of my iPhone 4s to see what this device was capable of...and I am surprised at the results.  First, I had set my expectations pretty low; I knew there would be apps missing from the store and I knew I would be giving up some integration with my laptop and iPad.  A week in and I easily have 85% functionality at a FRACTION of the price.  I am simply amazed at the price performance ratio of the Lumia 635.  The performance is comparable to that of my iPhone 4s - that is to say it does feel a little slow when using some apps.<br/><br/>The biggest issue with the device itself is the screen showing fingerprints.  That was easily resolved using the Mr. Shield matte screen protectors.  Otherwise, I've been pleased with the size, weight and battery performance.<br/><br/>As for the apps, the weakest link is the standard email app and the Nokia Drive app is simply amazing.  This device is worth the money just to use it as a GPS in your car...forget the Garmin.  The email app on the other hand needs some love and care.  You can only do two tasks easily with a mail message: reply or delete.  Any other action requires three taps or more.  Google handles my email and it would be cool to Archive and Move messages more easily.<br/><br/>I plan on evaluating an Android device in the future, but for now this has replaced my iPhone.  I considered an iPhone 5 but looking into the future, I already know the iPhone 6's are both too big for my (and my wife's) taste.  Given that, we are looking at other options.
I bought this phone because my previous phone would stop receiving text messages from time to time. I looked on Amazon for a GoPhone and this is the first that came up. Looked at the reviews and they said that it does what it is intended to do (text, call, internet). I came from an Android phone so I am used to pretty much going on the app store and getting anything I wanted because the app store is huge. On the Android phone, I would pretty much call, text, play minor games, Snapchat, twitter and Instagram and check email. This phone has the ability to everything that I want it to but somethings are limited.<br/><br/> Snapchat is a third-party software that in my opinion, sucks compared to the actual but it gets the job done.<br/><br/>Twitter and Instagram are great.<br/><br/>Email kinda sucks as well. I mostly use Gmail and there are apps on the app store but they are third party and I am not comfortable giving my email and password to someone that isn't Google or "name brand." The Windows email is not that great. I get the email but there are no folders like Gmail has such as, Primary, advertisement or even a spam folder. It is all just one big folder. There is no organizing at all. Something that was nice on my Android phone was that I would only get notification if it was a Primary email. But with Windows, I get a notification every time I get an email.<br/><br/>Bottom line of the phone is that it gets the job done and it beats having to go buy a $300 phone from ATT for $600+.
For international and other network use, the phone can be unlocked by your provider if you fulfill their unlock requirements. Be aware that TMobile's unlock rules differ if it's prepaid vs postpaid (Simple Mobile) service. These phones can also be unlocked by paying an unlock service (google). The going rate for unlock service is $40 so it may be better to buy the cheaper AT&T; 635 model (as opposed to the more expensive TMobile version) if you are going to use an unlock service. I used an unlock service to unlock an AT&T; 635. I also had TMobile unlock several 635s. In all cases, the phones work wonderfully well on French LTE service and likely on LTE anywhere in Europe. I'm getting up to 85Mbps downloads on French Bouygues service. That's hugely fast for any 2014 year phone and service, much faster than my tests in America. TMobile's Simple Mobile plans are industry leading for international travel and their unlock requirements are far better than AT&T.; A reason to buy the TMobile version (must use a TMobile SIM card) is WiFi calling feature. WiFi Calling allows you to call and receive calls on any WiFi network. It works everywhere across the world given a healthy Internet connection. That said, I have experienced both good quality and frequent dropped calls on WiFi Calling everywhere -- it almost works well but not quite mature yet. Still it's better than not having any signal or service at all.
This is a great phone. I bought this as a Black Friday deal, so the price was very good. It's a very good upgrade from the Nokia 520. The 520 can lag a bit - you tap something, and then there's a pause. While it has the same 512 MB of RAM as the 520, the 635 has a quad core running at a faster clock rate, and that makes a big difference in the experience (e.g., loading web pages). The screen is also much nicer being an IPS LCD. It also has support for LTE, which the 520 does not. Neither the 520 nor the 635 has an LED for a flash (also neither has a front-facing camera). The 635 does not have a dedicated camera button either. This phone also has the motion sensing hardware so that you can use tracking with Bing Health (like you would a Fitbit, for example). It's definitely a good upgrade from the 520.<br/><br/>I recommend the Mr. Shield clear protectors (wrote a separate review of those). It went on correctly the first time with no issues.<br/><br/>I also purchased the gray Incipio NGP case, which fits very well and doesn't add a lot of bulk to the phone.<br/><br/>Disclosure: I work for Microsoft, but I've never worked on the phone at all. I bought it with my own money.
Good Choice for a Budget/Replacement Phone<br/><br/>I was using Android phones (Samsung Galaxy S Duos and S4) since last 3 years.<br/>In Aug I lost my S4, but due to contract I need to purchase this budget phone.<br/>Switching from Android to Windows phone seems to be bit challenging, but believe me, it is very easy.<br/><br/>I was little bit afraid of another concern regarding my contacts in Google. My all contacts are stored with my gmail account. But I am easily able to configure windows phone with my gmail account for all my contacts and calendar.  You have to have Microsoft account to use Windows Store, but it is not compulsory to use MS account for your contacts and calendar. I am really happy with that.<br/>Limited but all required apps available for your day today tasks in Windows Phone app store for …. FREE.<br/>4G LTE, Good Responsive and processing power with expandable memory.<br/>No LED Flash, No Front Camera, Rear Camera with considerably good picture capturing in sun light.<br/>If you want budget phone or replacement phone, 635 could be your first choice.<br/>My next contract will definitely on Windows Phone.
I needed an mp3 player for my daughter.  She has a phone for calling and texting only, but her cheap mp3 player stopped working.  After shopping around for what seemed like very little selection for shoddy dedicated music players, I came upon a deal of the day for the Nokia Lumia 520 for $19.99.  After reading about this phone as a potential mp3player, I saw that there was the more recent 635 for $49.99.  I wondered whether the phone could be used as a mini-tablet/player, without using the AT&T; service. The answer is YES.  She has used it for almost a week now and it is great. She can browse the Internet.  She can add a memory card to extend the 8 gig already available.  She is using apps...streaming YouTube, everything.  The touch screen is good, too.<br/>I also bought the 520 for 19.99 and it is working really well for my 8 year old for apps, wireless, and music.  They both work GREAT.<br/><br/>We have Verizon for our phone service, so I can't say anything about how well the phone part works.<br/><br/>If you don't have a smartphone, or want a spare to hold music, this is perfect!
i strongly dislike windows and microsoft in general, but this is a fantastic product. specs are incredible for the price. windows phone 8.1 is light, simple, and actually benefits from its lack of popular android/ios apps. rather than a handheld entertainment machine, it's mainly a pocketable communication device, and it plays that role flawlessly.<br/>hardware is great. all plastic, but nokia made it feel clean and solid. buttons are part of the shell which makes it them harder to break. call quality is amazing, battery life is at least 2 days standby, reception is better than my iphone, and it actually vibrates enough for me to feel it when i'm moving. probably the worst thing about this is its camera, but it's about as good as an iphone 4 so for $50 i can't really complain. no flash doesn't even bother me either — those stupid tiny led's make shots look horrible anyway.<br/>also the colorful shells you can buy for like ten bucks each are cool.
I worked on the Windows 7 development team for 5 years and I hated Windows Phone.  Ironic right...  But if you can't beat them join em I suppose.  My wife trashes her phones, I have to buy a new one every 5-6 months.  I got fed up paying $300+ for Samsung devices so I bought her this lumia 635 for $70 on amazon.  We are with cricket on the PRO plan and this worked without any unlocking or problems with our "BYOD" sim card (bring your own device.)<br/><br/>She said it took some getting use to the new OS but she really likes it.  It takes great pictures and is reliable.  Battery life has always been a battle for her, she talks a lot and this is rarely dead... Certainly last much longer then her last galaxy S4.  When she breaks this one I'll be buying another Lumia..
At this price point, with no contract... it is a hard sell to get anything other than this if you are in the market for a windows phone.
For the price you can't beat it.  Since I am a windows user on my home computers the transition was simple. I found the key apps that I was using with apple but admittedly not all of them, however, you can pin a web page to the tile screen and be very close to an app experience.  As long as prices for windows phones undercut apple and android I don't think I will ever go back to either of those platforms.  The best part, this was a "no contract" purchase.  Just took the phone to my local AT&T; retail store and they installed the sim card for my current phone line at no charge.  So I am not using this phone as a "gophone".
I used to have a basic flip phone with AT&T; but it broke. Thus I decided to look into smartphones and came across this one. This is the first smartphone I've owned, and I've got to say that it has exceeded my expectations. I really like that even though it's an introductory budget smartphone, it gets things done. Its 4G LTE capability is a big plus. I also really like Windows Phone 8.1 (the phone's operating system); the fluidity and the optimization is amazing. I highly recommend this phone. 5/5
This is a amazing phone with the new Windows 8.1 . The new voice assistant Cortana is much more useful then Siri and this voice tech is coming to Xbox one and Tablets soon . For gamers Xbox 1 Smart glass control is awesome . The phone takes micro SD HC class 10 cards up to 64 and even 128 but for most people 32 Gigs  is plenty . This is a excellent smart phone for everyone young teens to seniors as its full of features and quality and only 100 $ instead of a 700 $  iPhone . All in all a awesome buy , Its better to buy on line for 100 then in the store for 169 or 8 bucks a month for 2 years .  The same phone is on ATT and T Mobile . OEM SPECS from Nokia Page below  .Uncompromised Performance<br/>1.2 GHz Quad-core Processor<br/>4.5 inches ClearBlack, IPS LCD Display<br/>5 MP Camera<br/>The Lumia 635 isn’t your average smart phone. Powered by Windows Phone 8.1, a Quad core processor and supporting a microSD card of up to 128GB of memory, it’s fast and smooth. It’s also got apps that update easily with live tiles on your screen at 4G LTE speeds. Don’t forget the inclusion of a free streaming music service – all at a great price!
I got this to replace my 520.  This works better than the 520 with 8.1 and has LTE.  I miss the Camera button, and I prefer the 520's buttons on the bottom rather that this phone's bottom buttons being part of the touch screen.  I have also been using the pedometer function of this phone...never thought I would or would care, but I guess I do.<br/><br/>Feels very snappy.<br/><br/>Can't go wrong with the 635 in this price range.
What's great about it: Features for the price<br/>What's not so great: Camera is mediocre, but that's to be expected for price point.<br/>I had the Lumia 520 and this phone was it's replacement. The 520 was fairly slow after it updated to Windows Phone 8.1, so I figured I'd replace it for $100.<br/>This phone has a perfect sized 4.5 inch screen, which to me fits in most hands perfectly. I'm personally a huge fan of the OS, due to the fact it does everything you need it to seamlessly.<br/>Setup should take roughly 5 minutes and you're ready to go. For the money this phone cannot be beat, especially with the quad-core processor.<br/>Pros:<br/>-Screen size/quality<br/>-Operating System<br/>-Removable battery<br/>-Micro SD card support up to 128gb<br/>-Speed<br/>-Typical Nokia durability<br/>Cons:<br/>-Camera (also no front-facing camera for you selfie fanatics)<br/>-Lack of apps (all the ones you actually need are there, but no games like Clash of Clans or Words With Friends yet)<br/>-Not a top of the line phone, so don't expect otherworldly performance, but it's certainly not slow.<br/>Bottom line: Get this phone if you either want a solid replacement for your outdated phone, or if you want to upgrade to Windows Phone, without getting locked into a 2-year contract. It'll do everything with ease, and is a nice alternative to an iphone that gives you some more overall customization.<br/>This product is...<br/>Replaced my MP3 player  Easy navigation  Tough/durable  Good video quality<br/>About me...<br/>My phone is my life  Heavy texter
Bought this for $45. A little tip for those that don't know - you can use this phone with an AT&T; Straight Talk SIM. The phone does NOT need to be unlocked. At $45 for unlimited talk, text and 5 gb of data, ST is the best deal in the US. Combined with a $45 phone, which runs Windows Phone great btw, you really can't go wrong.
I was a little upset that this Nokia smart phone was missing a feature that my older un-smart Nokia phone had which is the red glowing LED light indicating a missed call that stayed glowing off and on until you attended to it.<br/><br/>Other than that, I like the phone a lot!  Indeed worth $46!!  The sim card in my other phone was too big to fit this one, so the AT&T; store got me up and running (same account, same phone number) with the sim that came with this phone .<br/><br/>A few things I discovered about this phone:<br/><br/>1. You can see the screen in sunlight with the brightness setting on high.<br/><br/>2. You can purchase a USB cable that fits the phone and copy files from computer to the phone. I used that feature to create a few notes to a text file on my computer, then copied the file to the phone for quick look up on some of the phone functions (I'm forgetful).<br/><br/>If you want to see all the functions in this phone and how to operate them before you buy it (huge index), just paste the following address in a browser for the AT&T; Nokia_Lumia_635 pdf manual at:<br/>  http://www.att.com/support_static_files/manuals/Nokia_Lumia_635.pdf<br/><br/>3. If you have a lot of contacts from your old phone and don't have an online sync account, it's going to be hair pulling trying to put them all in using the tiny keyboard in the phone.  Much quicker to create a free Microsoft Account. and easily type them in at  https://people.live.com/  using your computer keyboard. You can then hit the sync link on the phone to download them to your phone's contact list in one whack. When you get a call within ear shot of the phone and it's from a contact you put in, the phone will loud speak the name of the contact several times that's calling.<br/><br/>4. The online data will burn a hole in your Go Phone balance quick. To prevent this, there are settings in the phone to switch data off, and WI-FI on to get the data free to your phone.<br/><br/>5. The Cortana feature is nice!  When you verbally ask her a question, it's automatically becomes typed in at the bottom as you talk. That lets you see if spelling is flowing correctly in order to be understood by Cortana. Ask her anything (weather forecast, etc) , in a few seconds she'll get back with the info and inform you verbally!  I think she will actually do task for you like typing in stuff.<br/><br/>6. The camera takes sharp pictures and the video camera makes clear sharp movies with good sound quality at a distance. Can copy the movies to your computer and watch them on the big screen.<br/><br/>There is a lot more stuff the phone does like amber alerts, weather alerts, etc  .. I just wished it had that glowing missed call light.
I recently decided to upgrade phones. I had the iPhone 5 and wanted to change to an Android with a bigger screen (I was not going to shell out $800 for an iPhone 6+) I'm using this phone while I wait for my new Galaxy Note 2 to come in the mail, since I sold my iPhone 5 to a friend. I have to say, I really enjoy this phone.<br/><br/>First off, the battery lasts for at least 2 days. That includes using a ton of apps, off and on those two days. For those of you who want to use the apps all the cool kids are using (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc.) this phone allows you to download and use those apps, as well as some fun FREE games. Games in the iTunes store that used to cost .99c to $2.99 are FREE on this phone! (Cut the Rope, Where's My Water, etc.) For those who like to customize your phone, Amazon and eBay both sell cases for this phone as well. But if you just want a case for protection, you really don't need one! This case is sturdy as a brick! The battery case cover is plastic so it can get chipped if you were to drop it from a high distance, but the screen would likely be fine.<br/><br/>The phone stays connected to WiFi very well and is pretty fast. WiFi stays connected for quite a distance as well. My router is in my living room and I can pick up WiFi sitting in my car out front. Pretty impressive for a cheap smartphone.<br/><br/>The downsides to this phone are:<br/>The terrible camera quality. If your someone who loves to constantly take selfies and upload to Instagram, this is not for you! Yes, the camera is THAT BAD! Facebook also has a tendency to not work right most of the time. If your creeping on your friends status so read the comments, be prepared to be dissapointed. Their status my say is has 20 comments but you may be able to see all 20, or just 6. It depends on how the app feels that day. Kindof a a pain when it's your own status and you can't see what people are saying to you.<br/><br/>All in all, this phone is great for temporary use, or for someone who just wants a nice phone that does more than they bargained for, on a cheap budget. Great for a teenagers first cell phone. (Unless you want to shell out $800 on an iPhone 6 for them that they will likely break within a week) It's great for what it is. I gave 4 stars because of the few glitchy apps, but I am sure those will be fixed with a few updates.<br/><br/>This phone is $49.99 at Walmart as well. I've seen people selling them on Craigslist for $100! Don't be fooled!
Plain and simple, this is a basic Windows phone and is being regarded as such. I have used Android, Windows Phone, and iPhone... my current phones are a Lumia 1020 and iPhone 6+. I bought this for my parents--- they have been doing a pay as you go plan and it drives me insane how they have to manage minutes. With them relying more and more on their cell phone, I offered to add them to my plan and needed a phone for them. I did a quick search and bought this Lumia 635. Honestly they need a phone that can make calls, take a decent picture, text me once and a while, as well as have email and some basic apps. This will do it with ease.<br/><br/>Overall construction is fine, lots of plastic and the screen is not bad at all plus the battery is removable. Basic setup was as simple as it gets and one thing it has that I wish my 1020 had was a micro SD card slot. I can also say that if I had even thought about it--- I would have bought one like this years ago for myself as a backup as when I had my Blackberry I had a trackball keep going bad and after replacing it four times, I finally came to the end of my contract and was able to get a new phone. Another instance I had dropped and broke the screen and had to have it fixed which took a week from start to finish--- would have been easy to swap SIM cards and use it until my contract was up or had my phone repaired.<br/><br/>I will be updating as I had it sent to me so that I could get it working and then send it to them to use. I am also happy that it is a Windows Phone as I am very familiar with how it works and it will make it easy for me to explain how things work!<br/><br/>Update #1: So I was going to use a SIM card that I had on hand... and I couldn't register online, so I stopped in AT&T; and was completely setup and out the door in under five minutes. Sweet! So of course I had to use the phone for the rest of the day to check it out and I am even more impressed than I thought I would be. Internet is decently fast, the display is nothing to gripe about at all, and I took a couple of pictures inside and out--- no problem there either. Again, no flash and no button on the side specifically for the camera, but honestly you cannot complain for the price. Speakerphone works very well and the screen is perfectly responsive. So for me it is a win win and have to say for the price--- it is a great piece of equipment.
Many phones at this price range aren't really close to the power this phone has (at the time of this review).  It is a quad core processor and it doesn't bog down when trying to make a phone call while background tasks are going on.  If this phone is replacing an Android phone (as I did) you should make sure that all of your contact information is backed to Google servers.  While the phone has a way of transferring phone number from an Android phone to a Windows phone via I had over 1,000 contacts and it didn't transfer all of them.  If you have an existing Microsoft e-mail account (Hotmail, Live, Msn) you should see import all of your contact information from Google or your Android phone using Microsoft Outlook.  That way once you use your existing Microsoft e-mail account, your contact information will synch to the phone.<br/><br/>The video is great on this phone.  It does use the new Miracast features for displaying your phone onto a HDTV with Miracast features.  GPS and navigation systems can be used offline if the mapping programs are installed into the phone.  This will make your device work similar to a Tom-Tom Navigation system.<br/><br/>Memory storage on this phone isn't a problem since it can work with 128gb micro SDHC cards.  Programs can be stored onto the SD memory card as well.<br/><br/>There were a few programs that I missed from my Android phones but with the way the internet browser is designed for mobile use.  Many apps that I couldn't get had a internet mobile option (except for my credit union).<br/><br/>The system can sync files between Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 computers using a Windows Phone app available for download from Microsoft (this feature is built into Windows 8.1 computers).  This program will let you sync Windows and Apple media libraries with the phone.<br/><br/>I was hesitant to use a Windows Phone at first but the features were so much better than the Android Phones at the same price.<br/><br/>Unlike Android devices, an external keyboard will work with this phone for editing Microsoft Office files (if you wish to do so).
I received this phone this week. I am familiar with Windows 8 and have had no trouble getting familiar with this phone. It is really easy to manage and set up.<br/><br/>I have an older go phone plan that I didn't want to give up and was concerned with data usage "consuming" my time. I went to the at & t store and they showed me how to turn off the cellular data use. Now I am using it at home on my own wifi, without being charged to surf the internet because it is set up to never roam or receive cellular data. I was squeamish at first because I just knew that it would 'sneak" in there somehow and charge me for data. But... so far not a dime!<br/><br/>It has a preloaded Kindle app. The screen is larger and easy to read. I should have no trouble reading on this phone.<br/><br/>I was able to load my music and some photos onto the phone using "windows phone app". I added pictures of my contacts to my contact list. I have a windows 7 laptop with iTunes. the 'windows phone" loaded my iTunes playlists and let me choose which playlist I wanted to add to the phone.<br/><br/>The amount of music and photos I can currently add to the phone is limited by the storage on the phone itself.(8 GB)  I will soon solve this issue by upgrading with an additional micro SD card. I plan to use the phone when I exercise so wanted a little more music on it for variety.<br/><br/>I was really hesitant to purchase a windows phone. I have had just a basic flip top phone for years. My son gave me an android phone about 3 months ago. I used it as a basic phone but never took the time to learn how to get all it's benefits. I lost it about two weeks ago and was looking for a replacement that had good sound. I must say I have really been surprised at how much I think I am going to like this phone. The key thing to note here is probably that I have taken the time to read over the manual and used the help area of this phone to learn about it and what it will do.
This is a great phone for the money.  Here are the pro's and con's.<br/><br/>Pro:<br/>-  Great 4G/LTE reception with AT&T.;  (You can use it with regular AT&T; service, just take it in to AT&T; and they will activate it.)<br/>-  Windows 8 phone is a decent and stable operating system which has real potential.  (See cons below.)<br/>-  Lumia app map/traffic directions that come with the phone are very good.<br/>-  Screen is good.  It has a few issues in direct, bright sunlight.<br/>-  Phone performance and build have been very good for me.<br/>-  It survived a 4 foot drop to an asphalt surface with no damage.  (It was in a Transformer Case.)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-  The apps available for the phone from the Windows app store are EXTREMELY, EXTREMELY limited.<br/>-  Cortana is ok, but if you ask "What is the score of the hockey game between St. Louis and the Colorado Avalanche", the best Cortana can do is bring up a website for one of the teams.  Google will give you the score of the game by voice.<br/>-  The camera is passable as a 5mp camera but the pictures are more like a 3mp camera.  There is no front facing camera.  There is NO flash.<br/><br/>I paid 70 dollars for the phone but it has been selling for as low as 40 bucks.  At this price for a 4G/LTE phone, it is worth it.  I must admit that the Windows App Store is the biggest drawback to this phone.<br/><br/>Other inexpensive phones to consider for AT&T;:  HTC 610 Desire (Android).<br/>If you like using the Google Chrome and Android apps, the HTC 610 Desire or the HTC One M7 may be the phone for you.
I am on the  $25 a month go phone plan and I Replaced my Nokia 520 with the 635. Its a little bigger in size than the 520 but nice and thin. It comes with the phone, micro sim card and wall charging adapter. If your already using a go phone you just insert your micro sim card in and it works with no trouble. This is a excellent buy as you still can use a smart phone with the $25 a month unlimited text and 250 minutes a month plan without having to upgrade your plan or pay to activate your phone like  the other cell phone networks . Of course if your like me just using for text and calling you cant use data without having to buy a different pay plan  unless you use your home or any open  wifi signal which is good and works great .It has 8 GB internal space for downloading music etc or getting the Windows store applications I also used my 32 GB micro SD card and its great . Its windows 8.1 which runs very smoothly and has a nice display of tiles and applications. Bluetooth which took me a few seconds to connect to my Bluetooth headset and home hi fi system . For the price its one of the best smartphones out there and<br/>well worth $99. One good thing about this is that it comes with a free Micro sim card so if its your first AT& T phone there's no activation fee and if its a upgrade phone like mine you just put in your own micro sd card and it works straight away. If it isnt a micro sd card you can use your new one and call AT & T customer services and the will transfer your number to your new cell. Excellent
I'm going to be honest here:<br/>I'm switching from an iPhone 4, which was starting to slowly show its age.<br/><br/>Initially, I wasn't impressed. It felt bad, it didn't seem to work right, or function properly.<br/>Then, I turned on battery saver. That completely fixed everything.<br/><br/>This phone will get Windows Phone 10, which is going to be huge, and prolongs support.<br/><br/>It's fast, and has remained fast. It has LTE, which is amazing, even on AT&T;'s network.<br/><br/>It allows just enough customization. iPhone has some, whereas android has more than the eye can bear.<br/><br/>Oh, the main thing... CALL QUALITY. oh my god, call quality is FANTASTIC. I have to actually turn the volume down when on the phone because I can actually hear them clearly! And, in this day and age, no one my age (21) calls anymore, but since I'm always running around, a phone that actually works is amazing.<br/><br/>Onboard memory is not so great, OS size is 3.06 gigs, on the 8 gig memory, so you're given just under 5 gigs to work with. Go to a store and get a microSD. If you like music, 32gb.<br/><br/>To be honest, I wasn't expecting much. To my happiness, this thing exceeds everything I need in a phone.<br/><br/>lack of apps is fine by me, I don't need 6 million apps.<br/><br/>Why did I buy it? I needed something new, and that would continue support. I worked and got the money, bought it, and haven't looked back.
It gets the job done and more. I'm a long time Android user also Apple. I love tech and appriciate every OS. I use Windows 8.1 on my PC so I decided to give this phone a try. I'm not a prepaid user and my HTC One M7 that I used was wearing out. I didn't want to upgrade yet because I'm waiting on some new phones in 215. As far as this phone goes I'm impressed first with the amazing battery life. I presume it has a lot to do with the not as great display but you get used to it, a little hard coming from a full HD phone. The free maps is amazing and a huge plus. The Windows interface is practically flawless and snappy. Its very beautiful I must say. I love the animations and live tiles. For a mobile device, Windows hits the nail on the head, much more practical than Android and Apple as far as seeing everything at once. I've fallen in love with and have been contemplating buying a higher end Windows phone for the side. I'm a very content person and make the best of everything so its very nice to have a brand new phone for under $100 with no new contract. If I were you I'd try it out. The app store at first was underwhelming but really its not that bad. I love apps, I had the best on Android and I've found practically all I used there. If you cant find them, then there is a third party app thats probably better, seriously. Good job Microsoft, you have made a great OS for the traveler. Thanks, give it a try folks!
PROS:<br/>Battery life is killer - even when doing heavy tasks like voice nav, will last a full day on a single charge.<br/>Runs everything I used to run on my Lumia 920 (except forward facing camera apps)<br/>Expandable memory (via microSD)<br/>Battery can be removed/replaced<br/>WinPhone 8.1 preloaded - Cortana and everything<br/>Good form factor, easily one-handed<br/>Lumia exclusive apps are decent<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>Camera is terrible. No flash.<br/>Screen resolution is fine, not spectacular.<br/>Lack of forward-facing camera means no automatic brightness adjustments<br/>Packaging is TERRIBLE - blister pack is almost impossible to open without damaging the phone.<br/>Tiny onboard storage - phone really won't be usable until you get at least an 8GB microSD. I'd recommend 16 or 32 if you store music on your phone.<br/>Speaker is mediocre at best.<br/>Some of my headphones don't seem to fit. Don't know why that is.<br/><br/>For $100, this phone is a fantastic deal. Just wear work gloves when you're hacking the blister pack with a knife to get the phone out. It comes with a GoPhone SIM card, but if you're like me and replacing an existing traditional AT&T; phone, if you have a microSIM you can just swap that one in and it'll work right away. (I don't think iPhone SIMs are compatible, but I don't have a way to compare them.)
I am not quite sure where all these negative reviews are coming from (Please search for T-Mobile Nokia Lumia 635 -- same phone, different service, more cheerful reviews) but this is the best budget phone on the market right now. Period. Windows and Nokia are the cellphone parents I have always wanted ^^<br/><br/>Big plus points:<br/><br/>- Snappy<br/>- Supports LTE<br/>- Feels sturdy but lightweight<br/>- Battery life (average user: 2 days)<br/>- Speaker<br/>- Straight forward OS<br/>- Hasn't died on me once (neither the 520 nor the 635)<br/>- Syncs flawlessly with the Desktop Windows 8.1<br/><br/>Negative points:<br/><br/>- App store >> but it is growing fast and really has all popular apps for the average Joe >> best free Nokia navigation software<br/><br/>You should give it a try -- you won't be disappointed.
Bought 3 of these phones when Microsoft was offering them for $39 on a Black Friday special. Two of them were for new employees for the business I do IT operations for and one is to be held in reserve in case we need it later. I simply couldn't pass them up for the price. We provide devices for the employees of the business and we run Windows systems (Windows 8, Windows Server 2012 and Surface tablets), so Windows Phone is the obvious choice for seamless communication. Plus, Windows Phone is far more secure than Android and much cheaper than an iPhone. Also, being able to walk into our local AT&T; store to activate two new lines without contract is PRICELESS. These phones are so easy to use that our new HR manager, who uses a Galaxy 4 as her personal device, had the '635 figured out in 15 minutes. She now wishes she had something like Cortana for her Galaxy. The so-called "App Gap" is also a non-issue. All the major apps are on the Windows Store, about 300,000+ with more coming each week. Sure, it's not a flagship device, but for the performance and features, $39 per device is unbeatable.<br/><br/>This device will also be eligible for upgrade to Windows 10 when it becomes available.
This review is based on my first 24 hours with the device, so bear that in mind. I think the value this phone provides is incredible. For under $50, you get an LTE Phone, a music player, a video player, a mobile web browser, a photo/video camera, a gaming device, and an email/calendaring client.<br/><br/>What are the bummers about the device so far? The screen scrolling can get a little jagged sometimes. Not sure why. Maybe the new technique of having the onscreen back/window/search buttons is to blame. Might improve with time and updates. And with only 512 ram, I can see switching between apps can have a little lag. But this isn't a $400 phone; it's a $40 phone, and it shines in its pricing category. If my kids were of cellular age, I'd get them each one.<br/><br/>Will this phone become my daily driver (currently a Lumia 820)? Not sure. My guess is the camera on my Lumia 820 will keep me there. But this phone has so many uses outside of just being a phone, that it has definitely earned a place in my device lineup, and its great having a backup device when needed.
It's been pretty good so far. I've had it for nearly 3 months and it does its phone functionalities ok. I mainly use it for texting and calling because I have multiple devices for apps and entertainment. I am not a heavy user of this phone, so a full charge lasts me about 3-5 days, mostly on standby. The speaker on this one is crazy loud, but not so good in terms of sound quality. I've dropped this once, about 4 feet high, back cover fell off, and when I looked at this there were no cracks and the phone was still on. This has froze on me twice though. I think the software is resposible since some of my friends have the 520's and freezes from time to time for them. I just take out the battery and turn it on again. I really like the setting to default apps, photos, downloads and other stuff to occupy the micro sd card. Though I don't like the fact that the navigation buttons are on screen instead of physical or capacitive buttons<br/><br/>This is probably the best phone in the $40 price range.<br/><br/>I will update this review if any major problems come up.
This works with Cricket and by simply putting in a SIM card and then telling cricket the IMEI number. You can even tell Cricket through the chat feature on the site. The back of the phone feels very durable and AT&T; unlocked this phone in less than a day. It turns out though that didn't even need to unlock it because Cricket uses AT&T; towers.<br/><br/>This review will hopefully help other cricket users. 1GB of data unlimited talk & text is $40 a month no contract and $35 with auto pay INCLUDING taxes. It uses the AT&T; network.<br/><br/>If you are forced to have a cell phone for GPS, text, and calling then this is a phone to get; it is a low cost phone but functions with high quality. The main use of this phone is checking email, weather, calendar, games, apps, and GPS. Also using it for texting and some calling.<br/><br/>This phone comes with a free music service too.<br/><br/>If you are forced to have a cell phone this should make it feel less annoying.
8/27/14...Changed from 3 stars to 4 as I am liking the phone as I am getting used to all the features.  With the text font fix it is so much betting on the eyes. If a sound update comes in I would like to know and install it. Also took some photos and the quality was not that bad for a no flash camera. For the price it was a very good buy.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Nice phone for the low cost. I wanted to stick with the AT&T; Go Phone plan but wanted a larger screen and some extra features. I like the notifiers on home screen which will tell your in a flash if you have any messages. Good thing because you may never hear the quiet beeps.  More on that later. For a novice I got used the the phone is a short time. Have not used the camera so can't comment. There is no flash feature.  Texting was fairly easy but I wish the text font can be increased as it is a bit smaller than I hoped for.  I use the $2.00 a day plan which helps me keep costs down. The drawback is no wi-fi or data plan. To change the plan to include wi-fi the cost shoots up.  The GPS feature works without wi-fi which I was very surprised and glad about. It may not be able to update road conditions but it will get you where you need to go.  So now the worst thing about this phone which is why I only give is 3 stars. The volume is way too low. Even on max 10 for ringer and max 30 for apps it is to low to hear in normal conditions. If there is a way to increase volume with a app I would like to know about it. I don't think it is possible but I could be wrong?  For instance with GPS on in the car with air conditioner running I can barely hear the speech.  I played with sound settings and ringer styles and none are all that load. Some are very tinny sounding and annoying actually.  Better sound quality and LOUDER sound volume are the big misses here.  Maybe a update with fix this in the near future. I hope so.
I was leery of buying this phone because of the low price and never had a Windows phone before. Don't be. If you're even slightly used to Windows 8.1, the phone is like second nature to set up. For the price, you can't beat this phone. No, it's not an Iphone, or a Galaxy, so don't try to compare it to those.<br/>The phone uses a micro sim. If you're just updating from a previous GoPhone and your old sim is a mini sim, it won't fit. Use the new micro sim. I advise calling the 800 number to transfer your account. I read in a previous review that someone went to an att&t; store and the rep told them they had to upgrade their package, and couldn't keep their 10 cents a minute plan. NOT TRUE. Unscrupulous sales rep.  I called the 800 number, and transferred my account to my new phone and kept my plan with no problem.
My son's first phone was a feature phone. I loathed it. He loathed it. It was loathed. For just making calls, it was ok, most of the time. It was a notorious 'butt-dialer'. Anyway, it got washed by accident and while the phone still worked, it was water logged and the screen was damaged.  He's a middle schooler and we want him to have a phone and they actually encourage the use of smart devices in school. Times they change.<br/><br/>I use a L920, and the wife an 820 so I jumped over to ATT to see what they had. I saw the 635 and played with it for about a minute before realizing it was the perfect device for my son. It's not a flashy, fancy, flagship device. That's fine because it's cheap and in the event he destroys this phone, it won't break the bank replacing it. I was asked if he wanted an iPhone. For my 11 year old? No thanks.<br/><br/>The 635 is zippy, considering it's a low-ish end device. It opened apps quickly. It loads pages quickly. It comes with WP 8.1 which is nice. The only bad thing is that my kid has a child account and that turns Cortana off.  Not sure I understand the reasoning for that but that's my only complaint.<br/><br/>Pros: Cheap, fast, great first smartphone, light, thin, sleek and low profile. Great battery so far. Comes with WP 8.1<br/>Cons: Cortana disable due to child account, no dedicated camera button.
This phone kicks some serious tail. Yes, I know its trite, but I do have an iphone 5s for work and have had every brand of Android phone there is. This phone hangs with them all. I love it - it's the perfect size, performs really fast, the 8.1 is much better than I ever imagined it would be, the Windows store has more than I'll ever use app-wise, and some of the Nokia apps that came with the phone kick but. The phone is the perfect size for me too. Battery life is great too - all day on a single charge and more. Now the cons, the screen is fine, but i hard to read in bright lights. The only other con I can think of is it lacks a front facing camera. Great phone IMHO.
I basically bought this phone as an unexpensive way to give it a try to Windows 8.1 (without too many expectations), and I have to say that I think Msft finally got "into the game" of the mobile OS. I am an IOS/Android user, and I can tell that this OS is very intuitive and stable (at least so far). Nokia use to make great phones, so That's not a surprise, and the GPS Nokia app (Here) is very good. This phone under 50, would be a great "mini-tablet / GPS" Wifi device (and a Bargain). Do not hesitate because of the 512 mb ram, it has ran all the apps I have tried very smoothly.
For $50.00...this phone is pretty darn awesome...I don't care what anyone else writes about this phone. It's perfect for 90% of any one who purchased. Runs great, pretty fast, simple, inexpensive...it's a Nokia...and you can unlock before activation to use on T-Mobile, AT&T; and Cricket without a hitch. Bought this phone for my mom and she loves it and she is horrible with technology.  Get this phone! It's worth it for $50.00 even though it's been discontinued.  Only bummer is no Front facing selfie camera.  Plus...it's upgradeable to Windows Phone 10 when it comes out.
For $50 with no other obligation, this is a great deal.  For the record, I have a standard ATT plan and simply put my SIM card in this phone and continued to use my existing plan.<br/><br/>Yes, it is noticeably lower-end than my previous Lumia 920, but for the price it works great and is worth the money.  The most obvious differences are the screen resolution, camera quality, and lack of light sensor for auto-dimming.  Worthwhile sacrifices for the savings until I decide whether or not to spring for the 940 when it comes out.
Bought this Lumia 635 not only because I needed a backup phone, but also because I needed a Windows 10 test phone AND it was on the short list of compatible phones AND it was a Daily Deal of $29.99.  I have a Lumia 1520 and just recently sold my Lumia 1020 because it was seeing too much shelf life.  The 635 is a pretty decent phone for its price point.  Plus it's no contract which is always a good thing.
I am a full time Windows Phone convert as it is.  I wanted a phone that fit my hand perfectly as well as had a decent sized screen and felt great in my hand.  This phone is it.  It has replaced my 920 and the only thing I can fault it for is not having a flash LED or front cam.  I guess if I paid more I could have that, but this is the price point I wanted with the right features.
After almost two weeks with this phone it is great for the price. I use the phone with my ATT contract. Quality is good. The screen works well and is a good size. Windows 8.1 is new to me but so far I have been able to do what I want without too much effort. If you want a smart phone and don't need a  front camera this phone is a great value.
After many unsatisfying cells (Nokia Lumia 520 included) this cell does everything I need.  The larger screen,sensitivity to a rubber tipped stylus, and ease of operation along with Windows 8.1 has given me great pleasure.  If or when I need a new cell it will be this one..  I am a satisfied customer.
Had an old iPhone 4 that was bogged down, having OS issues. I walked into the Microsoft store and found this gem.<br/>If you can get over brand and a different OS this is probably one of the best phones on the market for the money.<br/>On a side by side review to the iPhone 6, the 6 has more bells and whistles, deeper pixel depth, better camera, but on most features for the average user this $50 phone is a great buy. I also purchased one for my sons first phone he is 12 and he loves it.<br/><br/>Bells and whistles I didn't care for.<br/><br/>The camera is 5mpxl and does'nt have a flash or front facing<br/>Pixel depth is slightly smaller then the iPhone 4, its barely noticeable, I have a real camera so I don't depend on my phone for that feature.<br/>can't snap chat or face time (these or open source apps and Microsoft phones are encrypted to protect against data hackers.)<br/>I don't want my kids snap chatting or face timing anyway.<br/>What ever the iPhone 4 can do there is a app I can download to fix the problem on the Nokia, I can down load a Selfie app that beeps when your face is in view of the camera for no reversible cameras.<br/><br/>Plusses over Iphone 4 I had.<br/>Cortana equal to better than Apples  Siri<br/>I like the OS better, more customizable<br/>Faster<br/>Gorilla Glass<br/><br/>My iPhone 4 glass was cracked and it was going to cost me $50 to fix the glass on an out dated phone I upgraded the phone to this Nokia 635<br/><br/>I own 3 iPads, an iMac and Apple Laptop, and manage over 100 computers in 4 labs filled with Mac computers so I am not an Apple hater. I work in the Digital Media, Graphic Design and video production industry, I think Apple stuff is great but for $50 the phone sure beats the pants off an iPhone. Even with a side by side comparison to a 4s, 5s or 6 you may only notice the lack of bells and whistles. You have to stop and ask your self what do you really use your phone for and are you really going to get $700's of use out of the phone.
I've been using this phone for a few days now and I am writing this review from it! My iPhone 4s took an unfortunate tumble into the toilet so I needed a phone that could tide me over until my contract is up. It's a huge difference, but for a low end phone I have to say I am not at all disappointed. It is a 4g LTE phone for less than 50 bucks after all!<br/><br/>I am very pleased with the speed of the phone itself as well as the battery life. It does have a learning curve, but if you've ever used windows 8 is easy enough to figure out. The texting app is simple and I like the swiping feature that lets you text one handed. There are even built in emoji. The phone is a little awkward to hold, but the nice big screen is great for browsing the web. There is no front facing camera and the main camera is somewhat low def, but it is sufficient for my daily needs. It'll do fine for social media.<br/><br/>The phone has a lot of really cool apps. The photo editing apps are great, there is a great translator app (wish I had this during foreign language classes), and OneDrive. OneDrive allows you to access all your photos, docs, and and videos on any of your devices. I've already hooked it up with my kindle and computer! Of course, the windows app store is not as comprehensive as the apple store or google play, so you might miss a few of your old apps, but the important ones are all available.<br/><br/>The display is vibrant and attractive, even if it isn't quite as sharp as most higher end phones out there. Everyone who has seen my new phone is surprised by the quality of the phone for the low price.<br/><br/>Cortana is a nice feature, comparable to Siri. The voice recognition is on par with my old iphone, perhaps a little better even.<br/><br/>The expandable memory is a really important feature because the phone only has 8g of storage, so I would recommend ordering a micro SD card, which I recently did. I ordered a 32gb SD card for under 20 bucks, although if you spend a little more you can increase your phone storage to 128gb!<br/><br/>You'll also want to get some screen protectors and a case, although the phone seems fairly durable. The matte finish on the back is nice so there are no unsightly finger prints, even when my phone is case-less.<br/><br/>If you are like me and need a phone to tide you over until your next upgrade, get this one! I did a lot of research and this is one of the best options. I don't know if I will stick with windows in the long run, but I have to say I am pleasantly surprised by this phone.
They probably cringe to hear me say this, but I bought this phone as a backup.<br/><br/>My 5 month old Iphone 6 was showing some signs of problems - the backlight has a glitch and sometimes partially fails.<br/><br/>I saw this Nokia as a possible backup phone in case the Iphone fails.  I got it at a great price here on Amazon.<br/><br/>When I got it, I opened the box, put the battery in, took the SIM card out of my Iphone, and put it in the Nokia - fired it up and it worked!  I could make or receive calls.  When I put the Sim back in the Iphone, it didn't miss a beat.<br/><br/>I'm not really familiar with Windows 8.1 on the phone, so it was a little difficult to navigate, but the Nokia phone itself works great. - In some ways much better than the Iphone.<br/><br/>So what is there to like:<br/>1. Replaceable battery - when the battery goes bad, you buy another one.  Also, when you want your phone turned off, take the battery out.<br/>2. Usable screen size is almost Identical to my Iphone 6 - maybe 1/8 inch smaller in both width and height.<br/>3. Screen resolution - good - honestly I can't tell much difference from Iphone when looked at straight-on.  When you look at it from an angle, the Nokia loses some brightness.<br/>4. Camera - I love the Nokia Camera - It has full camera functions - ISO, White Balance, brightness compensation - wow..  There is no front camera on the Nokia - which is OK, because I don't think I've ever once used a front camera on a device.<br/>5. Case - The back of it is a hard plastic case - you don't need to buy anything else.  My Iphone is a brushed and anodized aluminum case that is so hard to hold onto, and so prone to scratches, that you have to buy a separate rubber case or you can't hold onto it.<br/>6. Charging cable is a standard Micro USB cable - no more $30 charging cables.<br/>7. Micro SD slot.  Yup, it has a Micro SD slot, so you can put anything on it you want.<br/>8. FM Radio - this phone has an FM Radio built in - works great - You can just leave yourself plugged in all the time<br/>9. There are tons of apps built into the phone<br/>10.  So cheap it's easy to replace if you lose it.<br/><br/>Things I don't like:<br/>1, Doesn't have a silence switch - I guess you have to just hold the volume down until it silences<br/>2. You have to have a Microsoft ID to get many of the apps to work.  Every app asks if it can track you<br/>3. It doesn't seem intuitive to navigate - that's just windows 8.1 - I'm sure it works fine once you figure it out.<br/>4. No front phone - actually I like this - but I read somewhere that's the fatal flaw of this phone.  No it is not.  I don't skype.  I don't need pictures of myself.  I need a phone that works, and the camera on the back works fine.<br/><br/>You want a good, cheap smart phone?  This is it.  You want a smart phone for your 12 year old?  You got your more expensive phone lost or stolen and you can't afford another one?  This is it.  Your phone on the fritz and you need one to get you by until you get it fixed?  This is it.  You want a cheap as dirt music player, remote control, FM radio or any number of other things?  This is it.<br/><br/>I bought it as a backup to my Iphone, but it has some features the Iphone doesn't and if I lose it, I go buy another one.  Heck I'm thinking of turning this on and using it as a second live phone - I like it that much.
I'm probably going to be kicking myself for a while yet, but this phone, which cost me $50, and costs me $50/mo (after tax), delivers exactly what I was getting out of the Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini ($400 at the time I started paying for it) I was still paying off when I switched from that phone and Sprint to this phone and AT&T;'s pre-paid. There's no extra little extra fee between the monthly cost and the tax like there was with my post-paid plan with Sprint, and the base cost of the plan is $10 cheaper.<br/><br/>I don't take selfies, I'm not a huge shutter-bug in general, and every app I use on a daily basis is also available on the Windows phone platform. On top of that, the Cortana assistant makes setting up reminders and alarms an absolute breeze. Phone call quality both in service and audio quality has been equal to my old phone as well.<br/><br/>Personally, after having a plan that had 1gb of data per month for over a year, I find that I -never- hit that cap (and I have the phone set to shut off data after hitting 900mb and I never hit that either).<br/><br/>Overall, I find myself with a phone that cost 1/4th as much, on a plan that costs at least $10 less per month, on an identical plan (unlimited talk/text 1gb data/mo) and a phone that delivers exactly what I was getting from my old phone and a little extra. I even brought my number from Sprint over just fine, and while the lady at the AT&T; store was going to charge me $25 for an activation fee, I activated it online instead and I only had to pay the $45+ tax to get my service started. I didn't even pay anything to have my number brought over.<br/><br/>Windows 10 will be a free upgrade, but I'm aware that the Lumia 635 was meant as a "Entry/Mid level" phone. Personally it doesn't seem to choke on the Windows Phone 8.1 OS itself and some of the games I've put on it, so I'm cautiously optimistic about it handling Windows 10 well.
My daily driver is an iPhone 6, but I bought a Microsoft/Nokia Lumia 635 smartphone for $39 during the holiday sales madness just to play around with. Really impressed by what Microsoft is able to pack into their low-end Windows Mobile phones. The phone retails for around $100 off contract, but the AT&T; prepaid version can often be found for less. It can be unlocked via a code purchased from any number of third party services online. So for a total $90 or less (in my case $65) one can get a fully unlocked GSM and LTE capable smartphone with very good build quality. Main downsides are screen resolution (just okay), only 8 GB built in memory (but expandable via Micro SD) and the still-limited Windows Mobile App ecosystem. These are really great entry-level/back-up/travel smartphones, though. I'm rooting for Windows Mobile, though with its miniscule market share compared with iOS and Android, there are few incentives for the top software developers to make apps for the platform, at least in the developed markets. But for those with basic needs, this is a terrific bargain. Other than screen resolution, this phone's hardware compares favorably with the Moto G (another great budget smartphone choice but running Android). Moreover, it supports LTE (4G speeds) whereas the Moto G only supports up to 3G HSPA, and the Nokia typically costs less than half the price. Granted the Moto G does feel more premium than the 635, but not sure it's 2x better. The main advantage of the Moto G is that it runs Android and has access to many more high quality apps. Finally, I had a Nokia 521, and the build quality of this device is much better. Screen is Gorilla Glass, and the phone  has a nicer feel to it due to slightly better plasting and a less tapered back panel. Screen is also bigger (though same resolution so pixel density is a bit lower).
Since this is my first smartphone, I am unable to make any real comparisons.  Was having problems with a low-end phone that was still well under contract (AT&T;), so I needed a replacement.  Options are limited with the Go-Phones, but this model was getting good reviews, so I bought one.  And I just love it!  It's been a relatively easy transition for me even though my home PC is running Win7 (phone is Win8.1).  If you're new to smartphones like I am, just ask one of the "kids" to show you the ropes, my 21 year old son was invaluable.  Turns out, he liked mine so much that we bought another for him to replace an iPhone.  The Gorilla Glass is important to us as the same son has dropped and instantly ruined two LG G3s, hopefully this one will hold up better.  Amazon carries all kinds of protective cases for this model, we bought several, screen protectors too.  We've only had these phones for a few days, will update after some more time has passed.  To anyone else who already has AT&T; service but needs a replacement phone -- definitely consider this one!  Really great, especially considering the price.<br/><br/>UPDATE:  After using the phone for a few more days, I find that it's quite fast (quad-core processor) and has a lot of nice features.  I know some complain about the lack of apps in comparison to Android, hopefully WP will catch up.  In the meantime, you can pin any webpage to your start screen and access it similar to an app.  The whole thing is very customizable.  You can arrange the home screen tiles any way you like; change tile size and placement, add/remove them, add new ones, set the background image, etc.  Enable the WiFi while at home to save on data usage.  When you leave your WiFi signal, data can easily be turned on/off so you only use it when you want to (for those with a limited plan).  Additionally, apps can be configured to not run in the background (avoids wasting data).  The phone accepts a Micro SD card which will be necessary for those who need more than the 8GB of internal space (for music, videos, etc).  You can pick up a 32GB card for about $17.  Cortana is being well received by the masses, but I haven't yet tried this feature.  Still extremely happy with this phone, no problems or issues for either of us so far.
I absolutely love this phone. I've had Android smartphones and they were okay. The windows 8.1 phone is so much better. I know a lot of people hate windows 8.1 but I am a big fan and think it's fantastic. I loved Windows 7 for a long time but went to Linux for years. When I first saw the new windows 8 I didn't even want to try it. But I recently bought a laptop with windows 8.1 and I fell in love and even bought it for my Desktop. I can do so much more than I ever could with Linux or windows 7. So the next step was to get a windows 8 phone and I'm so glad I did. With a microsoft account and linking it with my phone, I can sync my contacts and settings and not worry about losing what took a long time to set things up the way I like it. The touch screen is so responsive and it only takes a couple of taps to get to where you want to go. The speed dial feature is awesome, the visual voicemail is awesome, and the volume is wonderful for those of us getting older and having a hard time hearing. This is the first phone I've actually been able to use with the speaker phone option. I got a phone with Senior mode on it and I could hear phone calls just fine with the phone to my ear but still couldn't use the speaker phone feature. With this phone on the highest volume of 10 it is sometimes too LOUD. And the volume for music goes to 30. I can read my kindle books, watch Netflix if I want to and so much more. You can even download an app that  lets you project it to a bigger screen like a TV because I have my laptop connected to my TV with HDMI. I just can't say enough about this great phone and believe me I've owned a lot of cell phones. You also can't beat the price.
This is a nice phone for a darn good price. If you want to use it as an interim phone you just stick your micro sim in the back and go. And that is definitely a micro sim. I may end up using this for my regular phone for a while being it is fairly nice in it's own right. There are some deficiencies like no front facing camera, no flash. However, I turn off my flash a lot of times cuz the picture turns out better without it. Of course, night time shot or very dark is a no go. I don't take selfies or Skype, etc. so not an issue there. microSDHC card slot goes up to 128gb so storage is not an issue. Plus if you save everything over to the chip you can transfer it to another phone real easy like. Web browser is fast loading pages as good as any smart phone. For web browser only does have a thing where you have to really mean it to pinch to zoom or scroll which is to say not super sensitive not like you have to beat it up or anything like that. Vibrate could definitely be stronger. Good speaker, mic, Bluetooth. Play Halo without a hitch. Windows Phone 8.1 is excellent. Cortana very helpful and understands very well. Removable battery. Lasts me a couple days with web browsing and texting mostly with a few short calls. Screen is excellent have it on medium and it's bright enough. Does not have auto dim and bright option. Pics are excellent and what is really great is the Nokia editing app Nokia Creative Studio. It's simply awesome to fix pics to color, brightness, size, blur background, etc. Haven't found out all it can do yet. Also lots of manual settings seen real time as you adjust for photo pros or semi-pros. For the price you just can't beat it.
jewel of a phone and only $49.99.  why would anyone pay $600 or $700 for anything else.  I've got a video/photo camera, unlimited talk/ text and internet with oodles of apps, games and cloud storage.  only $35 monthly auto pay for all this .YES, I'M AS ECSTATIC AS I SOUND.
Purchased for $90 from Best Buy with coupon.  Was specifically looking for a low cost no-contract smart phone to add to AT&T; family plan for $15/month.  After much research, narrowed it down to the Nokia Lumia 635 and Moto G which is $80 more.  Both have solid customer reviews.  Final deciding factor is 4G LTE for Lumia 635 and only 3G for the Moto G, plus the cost difference.<br/><br/>At &100 total cost, I fully expected trade offs.  I was surprised to find that the trade offs are relatively minor compared to the total cost.  Overall I strongly recommend this for users on a tight budget.<br/><br/>Pro:<br/>1.  Quick, responsive internet<br/>2.  Interface friendly and intuitive, though the windows are a bit busy.<br/>3.  Internet interface exactly as expected.<br/>4.  Internet fast, fast, fast.<br/>5.  Phone works well, good sound through phone.<br/>6.  Memory expansion with addition of Micro SD card.<br/>7.  All the standard a smart phone features including GPS directions.<br/><br/>Con:<br/>1.  Screen has zero smudge resistance, quickly gets dirty.<br/>2.  Speaker has tinny sound, not loud enough.  Functional to hear, but would not want to listen to music through it.<br/>3.  Back pops off every time protective case removed.  Snaps back on, but worried that will not last if case removed often.<br/>4.  Camera hunts for focus in low light.  Decent pictures in good light.<br/><br/>Bottom line - this is a gift, on a budget, and my adult son is very happy with the phone.  My 7 year old grandson also approves!  I will update if there are any quality issues over time.
This is my first Windows smartphone and as I discovered its features, I really like it. The speed is very fast and smooth to use. I love the free steaming music service and no ads! The phone can function as stand alone camera, GPS, media player, and other stand alone basic apps like the calculator,etc.The GPS can also assist in the health tracker associated with MSN app (track how many steps/calories).The live tiles are awesome to arrange. You can re-size and rearrange the tiles to your liking. It is similar to a mini tablet.The Cortana assistant is pretty awesome in that I can use the voice function to search the web. I love the translator apps. I also appreciate how I can link/sync a lot of different emails from outlook, yahoo, gmail, etc all in one phone and be able to view any incoming emails. The phone is suited for professional and educational uses. Although Windows store does not have as many apps as the other app markets, it has the basic or similar apps found in other app store markets to use. The camera takes OK pics as long as it is in day light use. Even in dark, there is a bright adjustment to get some light in the picture. I wished this phone had a front view camera instead of only rear view camera. Overall, great phone yet I wished Nokia comes out with better ways to open the back compartment. The instruction where the thumb push in the middle and index finger at the right corner of the phone to open can be tricky and it hurts the fingers. I think Nokia should develop a mini button compartment to open the slot.
I'm giving it 5 stars, but understand what that means. Is it a 5 star phone compared to the competition? No, of course not. But it *IS* a 5 star budget phone for people looking for a great smartphone without a contract. First things first for people that don't know - this is advertised as a Go phone, but you can use it as a regular phone. All I did was take the sim card out of my previous ATT phone and stick it in this and it worked straight away.<br/><br/>For people wondering it it's a worthy upgrade from the 520, HECK YES IT IS. The extra .5 inches of space is very noticeable as is the much improved screen. The PPI dropped a little from the 520, but the newer screen is so much nicer that you won't even notice it. Again, this is the best budget phone I've ever seen, and unlike the 520 it feels solid in my hand. It also has twice as much memory in it, which makes some stuff go faster, but the 520 was OK in that regard too. This phone comes loaded with 8.1, so you have Cortana immediately and wow she's so much better than Siri. And the Here Drive free navigation system is infinitely better than Apple Maps.<br/><br/>Negatives:<br/>- No light sensor, which means you either set it to low, medium or high.<br/>- No front-facing camera<br/>- It's a Windows Phone, so while you'll have apps for all the major social media offerings etc you'll find it lacking in the big-name IOS games. The reason this doesn't bother me so much is that the iOS game store has turned into a sea of free games full of irritating in-app-purchases.
Bought this for my 13-year-old son, who needed a phone. He loves to borrow my iPhone, but I was growing frustrated with my iPhone's failing battery and even more frustrated with the cost of maintaining my carrier's plan.<br/><br/>Enter the Lumina. Let me say, despite a short learning curve, I'm pleasantly surprised by Windows Phone. I've found Android to be a mixed bag, and I actually prefer this. It doesn't have all the apps that my iPhone has, but it does have all the apps I actually use. The screen is not quite the resolution of the iPhone, but Nokia/Microsoft have tuned the screen beautifully. Beside my iPhone, the screen on on the Lumina is subjectively brighter and crisper. Speed was at least as good as my iPhone. Battery life is phenomenal--we've been able to go days between charges, even while heavily using it. (Plus, the battery is replaceable.) Finally, for $5 I threw in an extra 16GB Micro SD card. That's a fraction of the up to 128GB available and also 1/20 what Apple charges for the same amount of memory. Oh, and the plans! $45 per month gets my son the same thing that I pay $80 for on my iPhone. To<br/><br/>When my current plan ends, I'm buying one of these (maybe a spare while I'm at it) and switching! According to my calculations, I'll save 50% over the life of the phone (about $1100). Multiply that by three phones in the family, and I think we just gained a nice family vacation in the deal!<br/><br/>Don't hesitate. A good quality phone at a phenomenal price!
Works as advertised. Here are the negatives. Some stability issues with the IE browser. It kicks you out on occasion.<br/>Messaging will be a problem if you are coming from an iPhone. Make sure you turn off iMessage on your iPhone at least a couple of days before switching sim over. If not, iMessage will block texting.<br/><br/>If you are not able to do that step, call 800- myapple to deregister your number.<br/><br/>Anyone using an iPhone MUST turn off iMessage so the SMS will take over if you have not deregistered the number.<br/><br/>I hope this helps someone. It's very time consuming<br/><br/>Update: According to Apple, the problem will only be solved by having ALL your contacts delete your profile from their phones and add you again along with having them delete all the threads that you were included in and then all will be good.<br/><br/>ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  I experienced the same issues with my Samsung S3 and S4. So basically, you are going to miss out on some hot group conversation once in a while. I for one really don't care much about that. I call people when I want to talk.  Now these folks have you by the shorts if you like getting texts in groups.  Not me. I only paid $50 for this Nokia and it doesn't disconnect its WIFI like my iPhone 5S after that awesome IOS 8.<br/><br/>I'd still recommend this phone. It's actually a good phone and it does have good battery life. I'd say give this to anyone as their first phone. It will work quite well.
Huge upgrade from my Nokia Lumia 521.<br/><br/>Compared side by side with my 521 - The differences are noticeable.<br/>- 635 has much better color display, everything is more vivid, viewing angles are better, text is much more crisp and brighter, higher contrast ratio.<br/><br/>- 635's camera is also better than the 521, the pictures are warmer in color, and seem to be better in less light, even without a flash.<br/><br/>- Recording video is better too than the 521, in dark indoors side by side, the 635 seems to adjust more brightness than the 521, and in natural and indoor light, the 635 looks amazing with recorded videos, 720p which is the same as 521.<br/><br/>Overall, this has a little bigger screen at 4.5 inches, compared to the 4 inch on the 521, this has a quad core cpu compared to the dual core on the 521. This has Corning Gorilla Glass 3, which 521 doesn't have. And the battery (1830 mAh) is a little better than the 521 (1430 mAh). As for the built-in speakers, they sound about the same, with Skype calls, it sounds exactly the same, music playback sound about the same too, which is pretty decent considering this is a low end smartphone.<br/><br/>Conclusion : For the price (got this here for around $55) you cannot go wrong, amazing device, sure it would be nice with a front facing camera, and a flash in the back, but other than that, it's very responsive, no crashing from my everyday use, and it's a NOKIA! yay!
I am giving this a 5 based on the price versus features.  I got this for $39.99 as a temporary phone since my Iphone 6 plus died.  I was not expecting much but WOW this thing does pretty much everything I do on my Iphone  and while a little less zippy the speed overall is perfectly acceptable.  It connects to my car has all the Important apps I use etc.  I love it so much I am considering selling the Iphone and keeping this but I will ask my my wife for a slightly higher for Christmas If I do that.  not sure yet I need more time with this to see if I hit any walls were I get angry because the phone cant do something. Screen is low res but everything looks bright and clear and HD video look HD despite the screen actually being 480P<br/><br/>So instead of talking what it does I will say what it does not do.<br/><br/>-NO Selfie Camera.<br/>-Only 512meg and a few apps will not run on it because of that.  (For me it was only the GoPro app)<br/>-Cortana works Great but you cant do "Hey Cortana" due to hardware limitation but their is a workaround<br/>-Windows App store has all the essential apps but depending on what apps you use your experience may be different.  Windows Phone OS is for anyone who like to download lots of Apps apps and Games.<br/><br/>Again the 5 is due to price vs features  if this was a $100 phone it would have gotten a four and it would lose one star for every $50 increase in price.
I have had this phone for 4 days and find it hard to beat for the price.  Activated an H2O SIM card ($0.01 shipped on Amazon) and got 200 minutes, texts, OR MB of data for 90 days of pay as you go service for $9 (avg $3 per month). It's normally $10 but you get a 10% discount for signing up for autopay. Didn't even have to unlock the phone (which can easily be done on AT&T;'s website), since H2O is an AT&T; MVNO.  I'm switching from Net10 which was costing me about $15 a month.  Not only is it cheaper, but I also get to upgrade my "dumb" slider phone to a "smart" windows phone.  Only downside to the phone is the appstore is much more limited in comparison to google's, apple's or even amazon's.  For instance I couldn't find a "working" Pogoplug app, or an "official" youtube app since google and microsoft are competitors.  It also seams like Kodi, previously known as XBMC has been ported to every device and OS except for windows phone.  But for under $50 I can't complain.  Even if I didn't activate phone service, I'd have a WiFi device capable of Facebooking, web browsing, playing music and videos, reading books or comics, GPS with downloadable offline maps, and playing graphically intensive mobile games just to name a few.  I'm hoping windows phones become more popular and the appstore gets some more attention from developers.
This Windows Phone is extremely easy to use. I have had a Nokia Cellphone in the past and this one surpasses the old cellphone. I am happy with my purchase and highly recommend purchasing this phone if you wish to upgrade.
I'm an e-mail person and always hated dealing with phones or cell phones. But I did have a cheap, dinosaur-age-old AT&T; GoPhone, which I purchased after my car broke down many years ago. It is then that I realized that I needed a mobile phone for emergencies. Up until now, I never had a "smart phone", but when I saw the awesome deal of less than $50 (and dropping to $35 with my $15 rewards certificate), for this new Nokia Lumia 635 / AT&T; GoPhone Windows phone, I was sold. I now use this device mostly as a handy little tablet device within the vicinity of free WiFi in my home, at work, or waiting rooms, which allows me to use all the functions I need without costing me a penny > by turning off data connection. I've customized the device perfectly and according to my needs, mainly to check e-mails, stocks, news, Google, Facebook and Twitter while sitting on the couch or laying in bed. I also get a kick out of watching stand-up comedy videos on YouTube in bed before going to sleep :D And best of all - thanks to the SD micro memory card I added, I can play my 290 all-time favorite songs in my car during my hour-long commute without the need of being online. A micro data cable comes in handy if you want to connect your phone to the desktop computer. The battery life is sufficient for my needs, and I am extremely happy with this multi-functional device :)<br/>Samsung Galaxy phone and large tablet devices are still on my dream/wishlist, but until I can afford those, my Nokia Lumia 635 satisfies my  mobile needs perfectly :)
Very impressive for a low cost phone with a lot to offer. Windows 8.1 run very smooth.  It is very easy to setup.  After login to my Hotmail account, all my contact information automatically loaded into the phone.  Likewise with my facebook account.  It even combines the information from the two accounts together.<br/>Live Tile makes it easy to organize apps and file.  I like the "pin to start" feature.  It allows user to the pin apps, music, contact, picture, file to the Start page.<br/>App selection is not as good as IOS or Android, but it provides enough selection for what I need.  Facebook, Whatapp, Skype, Office, Bible, dictionary, GPS Navigation, Adobe Reader, etc. GPS Navigation is Great on this phone!  It can let user to download offline map.  Web browsing is very smooth and responsive on Windows Explore.<br/>The build quality is decent. It even has a SD card reader for additional memory.<br/>I wish the phone comes with camera flash and front facing camera.<br/>Overall, it is high recommended for first time smartphone user. It is very easy to use and has most basic functions for beginner. It is also great for someone who are looking for a great bargain phone.
Premium phone at the price of a cheapo phone seen hanging at your local pharmacy.  Runs smooth, feels great with the glass screen, vibrant resolution, camera is average, battery life is good.
I never have written a review of a product before, but I have to say that after a week with this lumia 635 I am blown away with its performance and the level of customization available with the Windows platform. The phone is solidly built, and though not as 'high def' as other phones, let's be honest.... it's less than $80 and you can expand the memory with a card that costs more than the phone itself. I don't do selfies, so a front facing camera is not important to me. The Moto G is the next 'comparable' phone and it costs nearly twice as much. The call quality, speed, colors, and screen are all great for the price. For $80 or less, this is an absolute steal! My gf has a phone that is $10 dollars less than this one and runs android.... you can't even compare the two. A brilliant phone. I got the Caseformers case for it and together, it is a solid piece of equipment that I feel will hold up to abuse and also is functional and attractive. I'd take the Windows OS over Android or Apple anyday.... they know how to make an intuitive and attractive interface. Look no further for a budget smart phone... this is the deal of the year!
I bought this phone as a back-up for my Samsung Galaxy because the Galaxy has been giving me fits ever since the last update on the OS. I thought because this phone is so inexpensive that it wouldn't work that well but it was just going to be a back-up, so no big deal.<br/>I have been greatly surprised by how much nicer this phone is than the stupid Samsung Galaxy. These are the ways this phone beats the Galaxy hands down:<br/>1. The battery lasts about three hours longer even when I am using it instead of the Galaxy. In other words, it gets me through the day and I talk on my phone for my business a lot.<br/>2. The clarity on the screen is much, much better than the Galaxy.<br/>3. Processing time is much faster<br/>4. It's a much sturdier phone than the Samsung<br/>Cons:<br/>1. It's very difficult to get the back off the Nokia<br/>2. Not as many apps available<br/>3. Screen is a little smaller<br/>But, hey, this phone is $400+ cheaper than the Galaxy.<br/>I really need a bigger screen and thought about upgrading to the newer Galaxy but have decided to just get a bigger screen version of this one.
A little clarification on the star rating - I bought one at a local mass-market retailer for $29.17 and am basing the rating on how much I paid to get the features. Had this phone cost what a current model iPhone or Galaxy S costs, the rating would be much lower. Knowing what components cost, getting an LTE device with as much CPU power as the 635 offers is a pretty good deal, especially now that the phone is in the sub-$50 range without any carrier subsidies or contractual obligations. Previous to acquiring the 635, I had a 520 lying around to tinker with and, needless to say, the 535 raises the bar considerably.<br/><br/>To give a brief background, I jumped ship from having an iPhone since iOS 8.x just frustrated me to no end with its quirks and instabilities. This phone was available at a too-good-to-refuse price, so I jumped on it and haven't regretted it too badly except for one area, which I'll elaborate on below.<br/><br/>So let me review what this sub-$50, no-contract, no-subsidy phone gets you:<br/>* 8GB onboard storage for apps, media, and documents : 8GB is fine if you aren't going to do much, but music will rapidly fill this up and don't even think about videos.<br/><br/>* MicroSDXC reader : Thanks to the available MicroSD slot inside, you can bump this phone's capacity to 128GB, which would be plenty to store a few hours' worth of movies, and a few days' worth of music, as well as downloading your entire region's map data. Of course, not everyone will want to lay out the cash for a 128GB MicroSD card, even if it only costs what a 128MB thumb drive used to cost some ten years ago. For around $25, you can put 64GB into the phone which should be enough for all intents and purposes.<br/><br/>* 512MB RAM : Windows Phone OS makes pretty good use of low-spec hardware. You will notice the hit when switching apps, as they will take some time to resume or load, so be prepared to wait a bit for some apps to load and/or switch.<br/><br/>* Quad-core 1.2GHz CPU: Having a fast, yet power-efficient CPU makes for a good user experience. Apps are pretty smooth and responsive, thanks to this abundance of horsepower built in.<br/><br/>* LTE Radio : Since this phone can take advantage of LTE speeds, you have the benefit of quick data transfers over the cellular network and (if you have the feature available on your plan) a personal hotspot that can provide pretty quick surfing speeds to tethered devices.<br/><br/>* 802.11 WiFi (2.4GHz band only) : I'd like it better if it came with 5GHz as well, as my neighborhood is saturated with 2.4GHz networks and 5GHz is the only frequency I can get quality WiFi service from on my home network. That said, the radio on the 635 gets a few feet more range than an iPhone 5, which means less hopping onto LTE for Internet access. WiFi has also proven a lot more stable on the 635 than my old iPhone 5 with not a single instance of being dumped onto LTE that was par for the course with my old iPhone 5.<br/><br/>* 5MP Camera : The camera sensor takes decent pictures but I have found that cell phone cameras generally only take good quality pictures when there is an abundance of light. Once again, considering the overall cost of the phone, the camera is only a small piece of the package.<br/><br/>* Apps : This is where Windows Phone hurts the most. I have a modest list of apps that aren't available on WP, such as Amazon Prime Music, Buy Me a Pie, Walmart's Savings Catcher, SmartHub (for paying utility bills), EZ Receipts from WageWorks, and a few others. While Apple's app ecosystem is incredibly crowded, Microsoft's is practically at the extreme opposite.<br/><br/>Something worth noting about charging: I have a pair of Anker chargers that charge this device with no issues, but the rest of my chargers that I have scattered about the house will cause the phone to display a "charging slowly" message. I might wait until some high-end Anker cables go on sale or just suck it up, since the phone does charge anyway.<br/><br/>Another thing worth noting: If you want to use this device with corporate email, be advised that some companies disable the SD card reader (some percent of those will only disable if it can't be encrypted). Bear this in mind if you install apps on the SD card, as those apps might become unavailable once you enroll the phone. WP8 doesn't have the encryption controls surfaced, so it's up to the system admin to set up encryption policies correctly, and even then I can't say for sure whether or not the SD card can be encrypted or not.<br/><br/>When ordering or purchasing this phone for post-paid service, please note that you will need to go in person to have a new SIM card set up if you are going to transfer your existing number to it, unless your existing phone already has a micro-SIM card.<br/><br/>All in all, having come from iOS, there isn't that big of a learning curve going to WP8 and this device does not disappoint. I'm looking forward to seeing the 640 or 640XL on AT&T; and seeing what it offers, but this has been a pretty good device for the money.
The Lumia 635 is a build off the original 630 and an upgrade from the 525. Keep in mind this is a budget smartphone running the windows 8.1 OS with Cortana beta on board. The 635 is running a snapdragon 400 quad core processor and 512MB of ram, now the ram is low but the operating system design doesn’t require that much ram so the phone runs smooth even under heavy multitasking with sometimes only a slight delay.<br/>  The screen  is 4.5” with Nokia’s famous clear black display. It’s crisp, clear and bright enough to use in sunlight when your outdoors. The colors however are a bit lacking but it’s still a beautiful overall screen that’s just the right size for one handed use.<br/>  While built just to keep you sort of entertained and informed the 635 runs Microsoft’s office 365 mobile hub with one drive. So if your, say keeping track of your checkbook on excel and maybe blogging from word. The phone’s processor runs this platform very easily and smoothly. Editing word, and some excel spread sheets and workbooks can be done in a very natural since much like on your pc or tablet.<br/>  The windows app store is growing thought still no match for android and IOS, chances are you will find what you’re looking for though with all the social media apps like Facebook and Instagram and twitter all there. There are plenty of mobility and productive apps in the store and many are free.<br/>The GPS system works well and there are a lot of apps in the store for navigation if you don’t like Nokia’s Here Drive, the phone can download and store maps so they can be used if your offline if don’t want to use up your data while you’re driving. In Here Drive traffic, and speed alerts are mostly up to date and as close to real time as it gets. I have found it to be a very useful app in the short time I have used it.<br/>  The 635 has one major improvement over many of the other no contract budget phones and that is its 4G LTE. On ATT’s network it gets near broadband speeds with only two bars showing. It also has a built in WIFI hotspot to connect your tablet or laptop. Streaming music and videos won’t be a problem if that’s what you enjoy. Data is not an issue either downloading emails and documents or PDF files is very quick.<br/><br/>The phone is short on onboard memory with only 8GB and the OS uses roughly four of that. But it does have upgrade capabilities with a micro SD card slot that supports up to 128 GB. Storage Since is built in to the operating system and you can store your apps, music, documents and maps on the card. Pick up a high speed card and your storage worries are over.<br/><br/>The most impressive thing about this phone besides its blazing speed is how well it becomes a companion with your windows 8 PC, pictures, music, video and documents stored on your PC is on your phone if you use One Drive. Even your color theme will transfer to your computer in seconds if you desire. Your favorite web page book marks on your pc are also on your phone’s browser.<br/>  Cortana shouldn’t be over looked either, it a fun new way to interact with the device, as you use it, the device learns about your day to day life and even reminds you when it’s time to leave for work or come home, at the same time it shows you currant traffic and weather around you. Keeping a calendar has never been better, all you need to do is speak in your natural voice and Cortana adds things to your outlook or google calendar. Simple reminders, alarms, and notes are just as easy. The 635 will also read your incoming text messages to you while you drive if you so choose, Cortana will reply for you simply by using your voice over Bluetooth or just by speaking depending on how you set it up.<br/><br/>It has only a 5MP rear facing camera that can shoot 720P video’s it has no led or flash but still takes very good pictures and video’s that will upload to your PC automatically without having to use a cable to sync.<br/>The battery life is pretty good, I get about 8 to 10 hours of heavy use. That’s listening to music, using Bluetooth and the hot spot often with the screen settings on high along with performance on high as well.<br/><br/>Over all this is a five star phone because of its price and ease of use. One last piece of advice however. It feels very slick in your hand, it’s also very light and thin, I would pick out some sort of case while you’re placing your order. It does feel and look like a quality device but Nokia is famous for its uni-body construction and this phone is no different. There are many different color backs or shells you can buy from the Microsoft store, Nokia or Amazon, but it won’t improve how slick the phone is. A silicone soft case makes this unit feel better in your hand.
This is my first Windows phone but I am a long-time smartphone user.<br/>Iphone 3g<br/>HTC Inspre 4g<br/>Iphone 4s<br/>Samsung S3<br/><br/>I've seen the good and bad of both iOS and Android.<br/><br/>I have been using my new Nokia Lumia 635 for about a week and I must say, I am VERY impressed. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and I will try to touch on a few things, good and bad, that stood out to me.<br/><br/>The Screen: I knew going into this that the device had a sub-par, low resolution screen. I don't know what kind of voodoo magic Nokia is using but the screen is impressive for such a low resolution display. Everything looks bright and crisp until you view black text on with backgrounds, not a deal breaker of course, but worth noting.<br/><br/>Build Quality: For less than $100 I was expecting a cheap, plastic, toy-like phone. I was dead wrong. The phone feels very solid in the hand. I did notice some very minor plastic clicking from the back cover when the phone is held in the landscape orientation and some torquing force is applied. Very minor.<br/><br/>Battery Life: I don't know if this goes for all Windows phones but WOW. This thing has tons of juice. I would always have to charge my other devices mid-day. I have been testing to see just how long it will last and i have been getting a little over 30 hours. Your results will very of course but for whatever its worth I text a lot, very few phone calls, check lots of email(syncing three account) and check facebook/twitter a bit.<br/><br/>Call quality: This leaves something to be desired. It is loud enough but tinny sounding and kind of annoying. I've tested with a few different phones and they all sounded tinny but had no complaints on how I sounded.<br/><br/>The App Store: This may be a deal breaker for some. The Windows phone app store does not even begin to compare to the app stores of iOS and Android. You can view the Windows phone app store online to get an idea of what they have to offer. I own an Android tablet so I am able to make due using the tablet for apps I need, but this may be an issue for some.<br/><br/>Overall I am very pleased with this phone, any aspects I didn't mention are preforming well and I felt I didn't need to break down every feature of the phone.
Best smartphone for the dollars spent, PERIOD!  I did not need or want a $800 flagship phone.  I make phone calls, send text, get weather info,  view maps with turn by turn navigation, take a few pictures and search the the internet when away from the house.  I added a 32GB SD card for $12.95 and have plenty of room for my music.  It is built like a tank and slides in and out of my pocket with ease. I never have to worry about it getting stolen.  All those iphone and Galaxy fans would be too embarrassed to be seen with a Nokia windows phone.  Fine by me.  I am thinking of buying a second one to throw in a drawer just in case I accidentally destroy this one.<br/><br/>The lack of Apps available for windows phone might be a problem for some.  It is not YouTube, Instagram or DropBox that is the problem.  The problem is most banks and major retailers only write apps for iOS and Android.  This does not bother me, but if you are a "power shopper"  or are into "preferred customer rewards programs" you will be disappointed with the limited apps available.
I love this phone.  I originally had an iPhone, which I replaced with a Galaxy 4 because I wasn't completely enchanted with the iPhone.  The Galaxy was a nice phone, but I just wasn't a huge fan of the interface, the additional size, and I certainly didn't need half the features.  I asked myself why I had such an expensive phone when I used only a few apps and certainly do no gaming.  The Lumia 635 is perfect for me.  I absolutely love how clean the Windows interface is on mobile.  I can still do banking, look at stocks, take pics, read e-mail, text, Spotify, all the stuff I actually use a phone for enough to justify having the features.  No second camera?  I'm not a selfies guy, but there's an app for that.  Sure, it's missing some bells and whistles, but at the end of the day...do I really need something I use twice a year or...never?  Anyway, 50 dollars...and I use it as my primary AT&T; phone now, not as a GoPhone contract.  Selling my used Galaxy 4 for triple what I paid for this phone new...maybe I'll get 2 more in other colors to match my wardrobes.
Phone: 4 Stars. Not a bad phone for such a little price<br/><br/>Windows App Market: -2 Stars. There is not one app in Windows that doesn't have a superior counterpart on the Android market<br/><br/>I actually really liked this cheap(ish) phone and was nearly converted from Android to Windows...that is until Windows stopped supporting the only apps I ever use. Would you like to check your bank balance from your phone? Well, you can't do that anymore on a Windows phone if you bank with Chase or BofA. Would you like to have a chat room that contains a calendar, file sharing and SMS? Well, they took that away, too.<br/><br/>At work, we work strictly with Windows platform, yet I couldn't get any apps on my Windows phone that would sync with my work email, calendar, payroll or file sharing. Yet, my new Android phone allows me to do all of this. You would think that Windows would do more to make their software available on their own products. My husband and I have happily returned to Android and couldn't be happier.
I have to say...  I purchased this phone for my wife being her second Galaxy s4 died on her...<br/><br/>It has been hands down more reliable, the hotspot feature seems to be more predictable and the performance of the phone has been great...  If we can buy smartphones for this price and it be this awesome, then what the hell are we paying 600+ for other ones?  Cause their camera has a freakin flash?  No thank you, i'll take one of these..<br/><br/>It also feels more durable than the galaxy s4 and other than a screen protector, I don't feel as if this one will explode into 100 pieces if dropped.<br/><br/>For those wondering about the galaxy s4's that have broken..  The first one the DVI screen behind the gorilla glass broke while in an otter box defender..  The second one, the Sim card slot failed.  On top of that, both models the service was flakey, on att, but with the Lumia 635 it has been rock solid...  Just pop your att sim into it and boot it up and follow the screen prompts and enjoy the phone!
To give perspective, we currently own three iPhones, a 4s, 5 and 5s (along with retired 3 and 3s).  This is our first venture into the Windows phone OS world and so far, I am very impressed.  I was surprised how easy it is to use the phone with little experience with windows 8.  The voice recognition is significantly better than it is on my 5 and I love the fact you can add a micro sd card (up to 128g) (come on Apple!!!).  The camera is decent, the speaker could be louder, but considering I have only $40 (BF) invested in this phone, I am absolutely floored!  I took it to the AT&T; store and was able to activate this on my AT&T; Next account without any problems.<br/><br/>It is not listed on the HondaLink website, but this phone connected with our 13 Honda Odyssey via bluetooth and was able to make and receive calls.  HondaLink is a PIA, but this phone does seem to be compatible.<br/><br/>Overall, it is not as nice as my iPhone(s), but considering it is about $500 cheaper off contract, it earns 5 stars!!
Not a fan of the APPLE Proprietary Empire [and outrageous pricing]. Replacement for Nokia 521. Bigger screen for weaker eyes and big thumbs. Seamless integration with my Windows based equipment [desktop - laptop - tablet]. Liked my Android phone but got tired of chasing Apps and having to learn how to integrate with other hardware [ Senior citizen here]. Does everything I want without a big fuss.<br/><br/>As for the no contract side, here's the deal. Depending on how much you use your cell phone [I don't use Data - think free Wi-Fi at McDonald's or Starbucks] buy a $100.00 worth of minutes [1500] and the minutes are good for a year. And left overs roll over. Beats paying a minimum of $25 a month for 250 minutes. Do this at the local ATT store and they'll explain to you. I told  the guy and his wife across the street who like me only uses the cell phone when they need to. I got invited to a really nice steak dinner about a month later. At minimum I figure they are saving $400 a year [probably more].
I bought this phone about 2 weeks ago. I was looking for a pay as you go phone that wasn't super expensive, but still allowed for all the perks of a smart phone. I have to admit that I wasn't sure I'd like this phone. I'm not a big fan of Windows, but I was pleasantly surprised. While it has the usually Windows 8 icons, they can be resized to be reminiscent of iPhones. I've found that the app store has all the apps I normally use on my iPod touch. It's not giant like the newer phones so it fits very comfortably in the palm of my hand. It has one back facing 5mp camera that takes pretty good photos (see the examples of photos I've taken below). It was very easy to set up and I love the fact that the entire back case comes off so you can replace the battery if necessary. It comes with a sim card and a slot for an SD card. I had a 16gb sd card already so I just slid that into place and have tons of memory, although the phone does come with 8gb which would have been fine for awhile. I w... Read more
I'm very impressed with the phone. In fact I cannot believe how stable, fast and responsive the phone is. The only reason, I've bought the phone, is to try Windows 8.1 system. So far I'm very impressed. It took no more than an hour to learn all the settings and the os principles, very intuitive and easy. App store doesn't have much choices, but it won't be long before it expands as we've seen with app stores for both apple and android. The phone is an excellent choice for people just switching to smartphones or to experienced users as well. The phone does have its cons as well, such as low resolution display (not bad as someone may think); absent ambient light sensor and front facing camera; and low resolution rear camera. Those things don't bother me at all, but buyers need to consider those things before making their decision of buying the phone or looking for something else. I would rate myself as an experienced user and I'm very satisfied with all the phone is capable to do.
I love my new phone. I was an iphone grrrl for several years but after going through three iphones in 5 years, I decided to try something diffrent and I am pleased.
I wanted to add something to this review.  I purchased this go phone and then took it to my local ATT store and added it to my account as a normal account phone post paid.  No difference from the $145 version offered at the store.<br/><br/>Really surprised.....I guess I am an iPhone snob.  Didn't know it till now.  I have always had an iPhone since the first release.  Well I needed a cheap phone to replace a work flip phone and went for an entry level smart phone.  Wow was I surprised.  This thing is awesome!  OK, the setup is a little more difficult that an IPhone, but I think that is just because that is what I am used to.  After setup, I have all my apps and the phone works perfect.<br/><br/>Keeping in mind this is a basic phone.  No flash and no front facing camera.  That said, the data speeds are just as fast as my iPhone 6.  Cortana works better than Siri, and the flow of the phone is perfect.  Easy to used and rather intuitive.  Any questions?  You can go to www.windowsphone.com.
I'm really satisfied with this phone. I have a prepay phone plan through Consumer Cellular which means I can take any AT&T; phone and just swap the SIM card. I have never had to actually pay for a phone. My last phone was an Iphone 4 that was given to me and was just starting to get a bit worn out. There was no way I could justify paying that much for a new one. I'm not completely sold on my Droid OS tablet, so figured I would give the Windows OS a try. I'm really quite satisfied with it. I knew going in the app store is not as substantial as either Apple or Droid, but I'm not a big app user. The phone is lightweight and I like the power button on the side. Calls so far have been clear and no sound issues. My favorite feature is probably just being able to slide my finger across the screen to type on the keyboard.<br/><br/>When my husband's phone dies there is a good chance we will purchase another one. I think well worth the $100 I paid.
This is one of the most affordable smartphones I have ever come across... Priced at below $50, I was truly fortunate to come across the Lumia 635<br/><br/>The Lumia 635 features a 4.5 inch IPS display with a 480 x 854 pixel resolution, a 5MP camera, 8GB of internal storage which can be expanded through microSD and a quad-core Snapdragon 400 processor with 512MB of RAM. It comes with Windows Phone 8.1 and will be eligible for a free upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile later this year...<br/><br/>Since you get access to full Office Mobile, you can easily create, edit and share your Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents directly from your smartphone<br/><br/>What's more it's a capable performer, able to outwit its Android counterparts of similar class with ease...<br/><br/>Unfortunately the biggest negative in the Windows World is the lack of apps, especially when it comes to games. I hope that too will be rectified with Windows 10.
I bought this phone primarily for use on Straight Talk.  You do not need to wait six months to have it unlocked, in fact you do not need to unlock it at all for use with Straight Talk.  I ordered a straight talk micro sim for ATT phones.  When you first put it in it will say invalid sim, but once the sim is activated and service is set up on straight talk it will work within 30 minutes saying that it is an ATT sim.  Then  you need to set you APN settings. I did the following:<br/>Settings>cellular+sim>SIM (under sim setttings)>edit internet APN:<br/>APN: tfdata<br/>ALL OTHER FIELDS ARE BLANK (except authentication type says PAP)<br/><br/>>edit MMS APN:<br/>APN: tfdata<br/>WAP Gateway (URL): mms3.tracfone.com<br/>WAP gateway port: 80<br/>Maximum MMS size: 1<br/>IP type: IPv4<br/>ALL OTHER FIELDS ARE BLANK (except authentication type says PAP)<br/><br/>This works on my Nokia 635 Gophone.
I have had an Android for many years and in a move from Straight Talk to Consumer cellular I thought I'd give a Windows phone a try.  The price was right at $79.99 and I had read several reviews that mentioned good performance.  Everything seemed to be just as expected at first but it began to restart repeatedly on it's own.  I thought it might be a Windows thing after an update or app was installed.  This was not the case however and after a soft and hard reset and a re-install of the OS via Nokia's software tool it is now at the repair center in Texas.  In the meantime I am fortunate enough to have had an old LG flip phone that took my Consumer Cellular SIM card.  Hopefully I'll have my Lumia back soon to continue my analysis and review.<br/>I will tell you that just as many of the reviews I have read that the Windows Store is indeed lacking in several apps I wanted.  I'm not referring to Candy Crush and the like but rather tools like Groove IP.  I wasn't able to find many of the bank card apps or other National store chain apps easily found in the Android market either.<br/>Other than the lack of apps I was very impressed with the speed and ease of use as well as the personal assistant Cortana that this phone provides.  All this and 4G LTE for less than $100 bucks!  If you aren't addicted to game apps or need a front facing camera this phone is well worth trying.  Now if I don't get mine repaired that will be a whole different story.
Wow! I had low expectations but this little phone holds it's own. First shot at a Windows 8.1 phone and I'm very impressed. You all know about the things they left off, not a problem for me. Don't use Skype, take Selfies or worry about NFC, camera is okay-no flash. Also not a gamer but I use all the social apps like most others. Can't beat the price/performance from this phone for 55 dollars. I own a Android phone and very happy with it, looking at this one for my wife's first smartphone. Battery life is a solid day's worth which is fine.  Very responsive despite bashing the 512mb ram talk, can't speak to gaming with it, that's not why I bought it. Supports up to 128gig SD card too. Dollar for dollar and performance it beats an equivalent Android device. Apps? Got all the ones I use except Nike+ so I'm pleased with the selection, it'll get better as time goes.Call quality is clear and fine as well.
This is a great phone for the price. I've seen it on sale for less in the last week but at $48 it's still a steal. The screen is bright and colorful, the operating system feels light and responds quickly, the speaker is loud enough. I like being able to switch out the battery and add a microSD card to expand storage.  Also, this phone is currently (6/2015) effortlessly easy to unlock if you need to use it on another carrier or another country (just make sure that country uses the same bands).<br/><br/>The only potential downsides are no "selfie" camera, no flash, and a slightly more limited choice of apps compared to android. If you don't need these things you will be fine. All the major apps are there, still takes decent pictures in good light, and you can always use a mirror for the duck lips.  Honestly, considering the price, this is a bargain.
I really love this phone....I had an iPhone previous to this phone and I feel, for the money, this is so much better!!! Highly recommend!!
Love the phone, its now my device to run apps over wifi (which works great) and a backup phone to my primary device which is a Lumia 1020
I purchased this as a spare phone for travel and for testing apps.<br/><br/>The biggest drawback is lack of a front-facing camera - definitely an issue if you want to Skype, but I'm personally not into selfies.<br/>Some reviewers don't like that there's no camera button, but that doesn't bother me in the least. I prefer to focus and shoot from within the camera app.<br/>Others complain about the small memory, but I installed a low-cost micro-SD card and that solved that issue.<br/>And, of course, some don't like that this uses the Windows operating system. I personally am a Windows Phone fan and that almost all features and apps are supported - and I especially love Cortana!<br/><br/>I researched alternative phones, including Androids and nothing comes even close in terms of value for money.
No map storage on SD card.<br/>The phone has 8GB of internal storage, of which about 4.5GB is already obligated out of the box.  One of the pre-loaded apps is called "Maps," which will display maps as long as a wireless connection is available.  If a wi-fi connection isn't available, or one wants to avoid roaming charges, there is an option for downloading maps for an entire country for offline use.  Unfortunately, the USA map is over 4GB in size and will not fit within the available phone memory.  Until last year, Lumia phones had the capability of saving maps to an add-on SD memory card.  No more!  That feature has been removed with Windows Phone 8.1.  What could be a very important app is now almost worthless.
This phone is great. I had a 520, and loved it for the price, but this new phone really adds the power that was needed. Best phone deal, especially if using a plan like Straight Talk.
This is a really nice phone.<br/><br/>I don't stream movies, etc. I am not a selfie taker, so the only complaints about this phone don't apply to me.<br/><br/>I love this phone.<br/><br/>Straightforward, uncomplicated, logical.<br/><br/>Special note: If you normally have issues with touch screens, this is the phone you want. The clear black glass and the technology they use are different from other manufacturers. I have what's called zombie fingers, normally touch screens don't register my touch, this phone does.<br/><br/>This phone never freezes or crashes.<br/><br/>I've had it for a month, zero issues.<br/><br/>What it does not have is sound profiles, you should be aware of that.
This phone is fast downloads fast, you will forget that it's a budget phone trust me. Has many features the live tiles are amazing, you can customize your phone to make it totally your's and unlike no other. Which is in a class of it's own, it's nearly impossible to have too of these phone's to look alike (unless you want them too) Cortana is a lovely addition she can do tons of stuff, like answer questions, remind you to grab a roasted chicken lol next time your at Walmart, set calender appointments, set alarms turn off alarms, tell you a joke sing you a song, and much much more. Enough said, I'm very glad that I bought this phone.
I am not a big fan of windows phone, but since my Note 4 came defective... I decide to wait for the Xperia Z4 or the Samsung S6... So, I was thinking to myself.... What should I do? In a meanwhile, I bought this cheap phone while I am waiting right...<br/><br/>I spent $56 for the lumia 635... And it works great! I am using the latest preview version of Win 8.1... It works great with all apps. I am disappointed that the camera is not that great, but it takes mediocre pics... I will keep this as my backup phone...<br/><br/>It's a huge improvement than the Lumia 520...<br/><br/>It gets LTE on Straight Talk too<br/><br/>I totally recommend the Lumia 635.
This is a great phone. I love it and have recommended it to my friends. I have already ordered five(%)
I bought this phone for my son who was using an Avail 2 through ATT.  He was constantly complaining how glitchy the Avail 2 was, and how it took forever to send texts.  He's had this Nokia Lumia 635 for a little less than a week and is totally enthralled with it.  It is fast, and the graphics/screen is super bright and clear.  And I love the fact that it's prepaid, so we have more control over his usage.  I also bought him an inexpensive but very nice case and screen protector here on Amazon, and he is now in heaven, showing his phone off to all of his friends at school and at church.  A great buy and smart choice!
this phone is awesome I have had it for a couple weeks not the battery life lasts for awhile granted i only use it for wi'fi so i dont know how it is about taking calls and lasting. I do however text and message people alot and it yet i only have to charge it once a day if that. The phone is so easy to use one you read the device help which is right on the phone. It makes setting it up easy as well. Funny thing is to set up wifi i had to skip the first setting then go into my wifi and add there it was the only way it accepted it but i have no issues with this phone and cortana really is helpful
Got this for around $40 including tax + free shipping on Black Friday 2014. My first smart phone, for the price I could not have asked for more.<br/><br/>No contract, so all I had to do was connect to my router and I'm on the internet. Videos play well without stuttering. Windows 8 is somewhat intuitive. Camera is decent image quality wise. Built in lighting so I can shoot in low light settings.<br/><br/>The gyroscope (screen flip mechanism) could use a little work, but eventually does its job.<br/><br/>Overall, for a No contract phone around $40 it is a steal.
I'd been meaning to upgrade from the Lumia 520, but couldn't justify getting rid of a perfectly good phone just to get a slightly better one. However, after two valiant years a fall onto a brick corner finally (barely) cracked my 520 screen, so I ordered the 635. After logging into my Live Account it synced ALL of my data from my old phone, reinstalled my favorite apps, and even loaded up the same background, lockscreen, everything! I didn't even have to reset my alarms. 10/10 best transfer from one phone to another I have ever seen.
I'm very pleased w/ this device, and still not believe in what I was able to get for the price I paid ($57.09 on 01/05/2015). For me the only drawback w/ this device is not have a front face camera (I love make selfies!). The Nokia Lumia 635 is my first Windows Smart Phone, and I'm kind of disappointed w/ the lack of apps available, however I'm really happy to be able to use some other features that windows operational system has to offer. I totally recommend the Nokia Lumia 635 Windows Smart Phone!
Great phone for the price! Everything works great and you can even use it as a GPS without a data plan. It is perfect for people that just want a phone to text, call, and browse the web. Windows 8.1 runs smooth and is a nice operating system. The phone is easy to set up, and there is no contract to worry about. There are plenty of games and apps, but the Windows store doesn't have as many apps and games as the Apple store. Overall, it is a surprisingly good phone. Better than expected.
I had one of the previous models and really liked it so went with another one.  I had a little trouble getting things set up on it, like I had lost my contacts, etc.  But with some help from the service provider, I got things straightened out.  I still really like the Windows phone.<br/><br/>I gave only 4 stars because the camera seems real finicky like I can't get it to focus right most of the time.  So photos are fuzzy.  But that's why I have a digital camera.
This phone meets my expectations and then exceeds somewhat. esp. the Cortana feature is awesome, and works really well. It even pronounced my non-English name correctly. Unlike other reviews, the speaker is very loud (louder than my previous iphone 4). The nokia offline map works great. All these under $100! Just the GPS with offline map feature is worth that much. So it is a steal. If you are looking for smartphone with limited budget, I highly recommend this.
I got a real bargain by purchasing it with Amazon. It was by far the best price for what I wanted. The phone has exceeded my expectations. I did all kinds of research before I got this phone. Windows 8.1 has this feature called Ease of Access and it is here in this phone. I am visually impaired and I needed a phone that could not only show a picture of the person, but also announce who it is verbally. This phone is absolutely fabulous. <)))><
i absolutely love this phone....plays music very clear and loud. games are detailed and clear. using the speaker while calling someone is easy and so clear to hear and understand. all around a great phone/mini computer!!! if you can use windows 8 on your PC/laptop you can use this phone!!! oh yeah the camera is great....i recommend this phone to anyone that is switching from Iphone, android or even old flip phones.....easy easy easy!!!!
I really like this phone so far. Great smartphone alternative if you don't want to pay $400+ for an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy whatever. It does the same things. Plus, I have a Windows computer and hotmail email so everything syncs up. I'm even impressed with battery life considering how long I'm on it everyday with emails, texting, and talking. I rated it 4 out of 5 because not every app is compatible with the Windows OS (yet).
I'm an old guy (74) who just gave up his eight year old Motorola "Slider," to join the 21st Century! I'm really challenged  to learn the multiple functions this 635 Lumia offers. It was such a super low price from Amazon, for this high quality phone. It's not so large that I can't carry it in the back pocket of my denims. I'm still learning to be "Careful,---it's easy to find yourself calling someone--by accident!
Shipping was in point and phone as described. A few flaws with it.  After setting up my phone , and then inserting my SD card, that phone didn't recognize it. Hadto do a complete reset and start all over. It did recognize the card after all of that. I do miss the auto adjust for the brightness. All in all, the phone is great, just a few things that need to be tweaked. It is bigger than the 520 which I think is nice.
It is a great phone to talk on.  you can install and change out the battery.  Very durable.  Get phone if you don't care for a contract.  You can go to a go phone or conventinal billing if let be.  The phone takes descent pictures and videos,  especially outside.  You can put a giant mini SD card in this phone and store memorys for years.  It is great if you are a bang for your buck kinda person.  Go for it.
This phone is nearly as quick and nimble as it's higher spec'd cousins. I am really enjoying it. I don't use skype on this phone (no FF camera) and I don't really take photos on it (5mp camera rear without flash). But since I don't do this, it doesn't bother me one bit. I can see the screen fine in high settings while in daylight. Really, no complaints. Did I mention it has LTE and Cortana? FAN-TAS-TIC.
This phone is GREAT. Let us get the cons out the way. No front facing camera, and no flash. Also the rear camera is so-so.<br/>Now  for the Goods.<br/>Removable battery and SD storage!<br/>Made by Nokia, so it is virtually indestructible.<br/>4glte!! IT IS A 4G PHONE!! FOR 50$!!!<br/>No contract. I use it with h20 / cricket prepaid and it works GREAT.<br/>Great low price pre-paid phone.
I bought this phone and put my SIM card in from my previous Windows Phone.  Even though it was a Go Phone, it worked fine for my regular shared family data plan.  For being $100, it's a really good phone.  It runs very fast and the battery life is great.  It lasts well over a day of moderate use.  The 5 megapixel camera actually takes decent pictures if there's good lighting.  There's no way an iPhone or higher-end Android phone is worth 6 times what this phone is cost.  For all of your basic smart phone needs, this phone will work great.
It's a great product. I use this as a tablet, a media player and a personal navigation device. My 128 GB SD holds all the 800+ hours of mp3 music, 42 movies and thousands of photos. Great stuff for peanuts when compared to other phones. Awesome screen and very fast. It does take a long, long time to index the huge media library at first though. After that first time it works great.
Wow.  The Nokia 635 phone is a great value.  The screen scrolling is very fluid and the unit itself has a nice feel in the hand.  Definitely an upgrade over the Nokia 520 and worth it if you want to give Windows phone a try.  For comparison I have had multiple android phones including Samsung galaxy S3 and S4 and I am very happy with this phone compared to those android models.
Purchased this phone to replace broken iPhone 4 and haven't looked back. Has all the functionality of an iPhone and was easy to transfer contacts, calendars and email accounts. Performance of device is snappy and cellular reception is excellent. Voice quality of incoming calls consistently strong with plenty of speaker volume. This device delivers the goods for a grrat price.
Great phone, Nokia's never let you down, 4th phone in family
I really love my phone.  When I ordered mine at such a great price, my husband wanted me to order him one also.  We needed to replace our other phones and found this one to be just what we needed. Facebook and email or easy and quick to get to as well as other apps. The reviews I read before making the purchases were very helpful in making my decision to purchase the phone.
This is a fantastic phone for such a low, entry-level price point. I have enjoyed using this phone so far. It runs very smoothly, and both images and text look sharp on it. I would have preferred a flash for the camera -- even a basic flash -- but I don't take photos nearly enough to dock a point for it.<br/><br/>At $79.98 shipped to your door, this is an easy buy.
A very good phone for this price. Do not expect anything close to an iPhone, this is Windows, but it works.  Activation is confusing. At&T; will ask you to signup for a monthly plan when activated via web. Select any monthly plan, even if you do not need it, to get the phone activated. Then go back and change plan if you need to opt out of a monthly plan.
I work well with windows 8.1 , so this phone to me is like night to day compared to using a Google android mess . 635 with windows feels so much more structured with an order to it. Its as fast as my old LG volt ..Im just loving the heck out of it, and it cost 2/3rd's less then a decent smart phone. There is NO going back to the Google mess for me!
I bought this to use as a Bluetooth MP3 player and it turned out to be so much more.  I did not activate it.  It comes with a sim card but I didn't want a cell phone.  It also works great as a stand alone GPS navigation system once you have the maps downloaded.  It was very easy to access the memory card I added to it too. (unlike my Dell tablet)
I had the Nokia 520 before and it was great, except for the feel of it.<br/>It just wasn't comfortable to hold in my hand.<br/>Then I purchased a Samsung Galaxy type phone.<br/>Big mistake there going with Galaxy, never again.<br/>Now I have my new Nokia Lumia 635 and I love all around.<br/>Fantastic phone, and I have 0 (zero) complaints.
Phone is super fast which is nice. There is no waiting on apps. Like others have said there is no flash for camera, but that is not a deal breaker for me. My co-workers and friends have iphones and they all like this phone more.  The price for this phone is unreal for what it can do. If you are in a pinch and need a phone....get this one.
I bought this phone for an older relative to use as her first smart phone.  Out of the Apple, Android, and Windows devices, she prefers this one.  The live tiles make it easy for her to access the most used functions and apps.  Battery life is also way better than other smartphones.  She can go 2-3 days between charges with light usage.
Slick little phone. Bought it to install Windows 10 preview. Camera not bad for 5M. Faster than my Nokia 1020. Will take an SD card, think I put a 16Gig in it. Have not installed a sim, just using as a mini-tablet and GPS. Too bad Windows Phones do not make the headlines. But, hey I was using cassettes while my schoolmates had 8 tracks.
I had a Lumia 520 and liked it very much.  I like the 635 as well, but not quite as well.  I like the size.  A few things are not available on the 635 that were on the 520.  Overall it's a nice, simple and very affordable phone and I like the Windows OS.  For now, I'm very satisfied as long as it continues to give me good service.
I bought this phone for $40 no-contract during the time up to Xmas and it's been great. The performance is snappy, the screen clear, the sound crisp and loud and feels durable and solid. I like it better than my Nokia 920. The camera is of lower quality as you would expect for an entry level phone but get's the job done.
I've had this phone for a while now. I look at the news, snap the ocassional picture, and try really hard not to get lost in it. If you are one of those who want a phone you can keep from spending every moment of your life with-in other words, you're not on the market for a second life partner-this is the phone for you.
First Windows phone, bought as an mp3 player, but after how well the phone works, and how good of a price it was, I have been convincing people to give it a go too.  The phone itself is smooth, and comes with great software to really make it user friendly.  WP may be replacing my android as a next main phone.
We were on vacation and the Cortana feature really helped us locate grocery stores, shops, and, I could keep up on my e-mail so I didn't have 5000 when we got back home. Overall the phone works very well. My wife is ready to get one when her contract is up with her phone.  I would recommend this to anyone.
Let's be honest, at this price point, what can you really expect? In this case quite a bit.<br/><br/>The phone runs smooth and snappy, apps work well, and Cortana is invaluable. Music sounds good, and despite the low resolution video looks really good. The only downside is no flash for the camera.
I bought this phone for my son and he loves it. It has Windows so he can sync things with our laptops. The camera takes amazing photos; the color is outstanding with amazing clarity. The only negative is no front facing camera but you can download an app that works very well.
I love this phone!  I did so much research trying to find a no contract phone for months and was so relieved to discover this one, FINALLY, on Amazon.  I can see why its the #1 rated no contract phone.  For me at least I found it to be extremely user friendly for someone who has had no previous experience with any kind of Smart Phone except for a Blackberry that I used many, many years ago and gave it up because the contract rate was just too expensive to maintain.  The only downside for me is that you have to register to get a Microsoft account to use "Cortana."  The camera shutter is too slow for me, but, I bought it for basic calling for the most part.  There are several pre-paid plan options you can buy which is explained in the literature that comes in the package. Set up was easy, you get your phone number assigned to you following the set up prompts. I chose the unlimited talk for $30.00 a month plan, way better than the $150 per month I was paying when I had my Blackberry with a contract plan that I was stuck with for two years.  You can upgrade at any time to include a data plan for using the internet, social media apps etc.  If you have a wireless modem in your house, you can use it to connect to the internet without a data plan, which is convenient.  I think the screen size is pretty decent, I have large hands so I was pleased to see that the numbers on the dial pad are large enough for me to use without difficulty, and it doesn't feel like its made from a lot of cheap materials.  The phone itself actually looks quite beautiful but the home page isn't that impressive looking, however, when it goes into energy saving mode there is a really nice screen saver.  I just hope it lasts!  It only comes with one recharger (wish there were two).  The OS is Windows, not Android, which I would have preferred, but I'm fine with this, its leap years ahead from the first generation Go Phone that I bought when they first came out, and I got this for $10 less than what I had paid for my first phone which was a very cheap clam shell type phone with no capabilities other than calling.
This is a decent phone for the price.  I've used it for the last 6 months or so.  As for the pros... Touch screen is responsive, and processor and ram are enough for a snappy performance with apps.  Screen resolution is good and clear, bright enough to see in sunlight if brightness turned to max.  Picture and video taking quality are good, but not great.  I migrated from an android, and the free Lumia migration app makes it relatively easy.  I did have to use a 3rd party app to transfer texts and MMS messages.  The windows 8.1 OS is easy to use, and quite intuitive.  The tile system takes a little getting used to but after awhile it becomes second nature.  I like the Onedrive system which will back up any pictures taken on the phone to the cloud.  I can then view the pictures on any Windows 8 or 10 PC.  Very handy.  Also the phone feels relatively sturdy and well constructed and not cheap.  Nice looking and sleek.  Battery life is terrific,even after 6 months.  Only about 25% is used up after a day based on my usage pattern.  Pretty good cell signal strength on At&t; towers where I live in DFW (I actually use Straight talk plan).<br/><br/>Now the cons...  The camera is VERY slow to start up, taking about 5-6 seconds each time.  It can also take 2-3 seconds after you press the button before the picture is actually taken.  So it's not very good for fast moving scenes involving a toddler or pets.  After several months of using it has started to freeze randomly every 1 or 2 weeks, necessitating a reboot.  Sometimes the email app gets squirrely and does not sync, also necessitating a reboot.  Wifi is 2.4 gz only, without a 5 ghz option, but this is not a significant issue since things still appear to download pretty quickly.  The biggest drawback to me is the anemic app store.  Most of the commonly used apps are there, but if looking for a more specialized or esoteric app, you're out of luck.  For some reason it still does not have a Nook reader app even though Microsoft invested heavily in it.  Alot of apps are also not free or trial only.  Android's and Apple's app stores have much more available.  Hopefully in time more developers will be writing apps for Windows phones.  Still running on Windows 8.1, and waiting for mobile version of Windows 10.<br/><br/>Overall a good solid phone, and very inexpensive at that.  However, the camera app is very slow to start, which is very annoying at times.  Also, if you're a big app user, you might feel a little limited by the app store.
I love this phone. I hate windows 8.1 on my computer, but I love it on this phone. I didn't want the Apple $600 phones; I don't think any phone is worth that much, unless it's solid gold. And all my friends and family are always trying to plug in and recharge their Apple phones, which doesn't impress me. And I lose phones a lot, so I don't want the anguish of losing a $600 phone.<br/>The battery on this phone lasts a couple of days, and is easily replaceable (unlike the $600 phones!!!) So you can purchase an extra battery if you think you'll be away from a charging outlet for a long, long time.<br/>I changed over to this phone from a Motorola Android phone, which I lost and wasn't returned. The Motorola was a good phone, but the Android Operating System was not much easier or intuitive than the IOS. And the Windows tiles are much easier to see and find than Android's icons.<br/>Negatives? I read that the Windows tiles can be resized easily. If so, I haven't been successful in re-sizing them!  This phone doesn't have a double sided camera, so if you love taking photos of yourself, this may not be the phone for you. Windows doesn't have as many apps as iOS or Android, so if you're into apps, reconsider. It does have Waze, which I like. This phone doesn't have a flash, hence it isn't compatible with a flashlight app. That's one I do miss. The camera is not the greatest, but I have a camera (remember those?)<br/>This is a fast and versatile phone, and is bargain priced for what you're getting. The display is crisp, clear, and bright. The speaker sound quality, for those of us who actually talk on their phone, is good. Not great. But I haven't found any cellphone that has great sound on a par with a land line. And I love Amazon's quick delivery system, since I depend on a phone for my business. This phone is compatible with AT&T;, and can also be used with AT&T;'s economical Cricket brand service plans.
I have used Android all this time. I had ordered a Nokia 520 from a lightning deal before Christmas and didn't really give it a chance before handing it over to my husband. He loves it. He did say the app store isn't all that great, but overall, he was impressed. I had been using a AT&T; Z998 and was beginning to have problems. It had lasted a year before acting up. So, I decided on the Nokia 635. After spending an hour + loading all my contact info, customizing my screen, and learning Windows, I was still unsure. I wanted to like it. For one, it is a nice phone, and two, I hate shopping for new phones. We have an account with AT&T;, and are no longer in contract. The contract doesn't bother me, but our bill is now lower than it was, and I didn't want to raise it. So, I bought my "Go Phone" Nokia 635 for 39.99. Where if you look here on Amazon, and type "Nokia 635", AT&T; offers it (without being a No Contract GoPhone) for $61.00. It's the same thing, just different packaging. Just drop in your current SIM, and you're good to go.<br/><br/>Anyhow, back to the phone. I loaded all my apps. Like my husband said, the app store sucks. I was unable to load Cartwheel (Target), which is OK. I'll just take my old phone with me when I shop and use Target's WiFi to use Cartwheel. No biggie. Also, I couldn't load Walmart's Saving Catcher or Pinterest. I'll use my old phone for Walmart when I get home, and with Pinterest, I'll just use on my Kindle.<br/><br/>I did purchase a hard case for this phone. I purchased MagicMobile [Dual Armor Series] Durable [Impact Shockproof Resistant] Double Layer Cover [Hard Shell] + [Flexible Silicone] Case for Nokia Lumia 630 / 635 for about $6.00. It too is eh. It will work until I can order another. I like my phone is a case. They are too skinny and I tend to drop them without a case.<br/><br/>The more I texted with it, I realized how cool this phone really is. It is the one feature I probably use the most. The emoji will pop up with the word suggestion bar above the keyboard (Android you have to search, and there's a lot). Don't get me wrong, I still like Android, but for now, I am loving this Windows Nokia 635.
Recently I lost my iPhone, and a quick trip to the ATT store had an assistant telling me, with 7 months left on my contract, that it was going to cost me 600+ to replace. What??? Said I, regretting that I hadn't taken out the insurance, I'd never used previously :0( An online chat with an ATT assistant gave me the useful info on GoPhones. This is the one I purchased. Having set up the phone with my current account, within a few hours I was ranting about this and raving about that, I found the phone frustrating and annoying. Oh dear I was missing my iPhone badly! I mean the 636's music player won't even see all the music on my micro card. Arghhhh!!!! But after a few days playing around, getting to know it: adding a few apps, obvious favs like Kindle, Fandango, Flickster etc and hunting a decent media player and PDF reader (actually still hunting for that). I reconfigured the panels, looked at the phone and realised I liked this interfaces better than iPhone's. I mean I have exactly what I want where I want it. Yes it doesn't have nearly as many useful apps as the iOS, but I rarely had those on my phone, that's what my iPad is for. Now that I use as a near substitute for my 2 (Apple and Windows 7) computers. Nearly!<br/>Back to the phone. It does what I want of a smart phone: receives and takes calls, texts and emails and I was able to download my contacts from iCloud. Browse the web, maps, ditto, though the are some really cool iOS map apps when traveling, I going to miss those. Dropbox, tick and love MSN weather. And Cortona, who cares? Never used Siri haven't used Cortona, never know though I might try it. And selfies rarely took one on the iPhone, not going to miss it, though there is the selfie app! Apparently!<br/>So I'm asking myself: why did I spent so much on the 5s? Now this is not as good as the iPhone but it does what I want and need and nearly as well as the 5s did, excepting the text edit feature, that's really bad! But I definitely prefer the interface and it is less than a tenth of the price. IPad, yep staying with that but iPhone finding it hard to justify and right now can't see the point. There's a possibility that some of those extras missing here that I get from the 5s will come back to haunt me such that in 7 months I'm back in Appleland, but right now I'm more than happy with my new, personally configured, Nokia Windows phone.
Pretty much as good as it gets in the $50 price range.<br/><br/>The cons are going to be exactly as expected considering the price and it's a windows phone. The app store is barren compared to iOS and Google Play and even worse as I tried to download a few games that they do have, like Temple Run, this device wasn't supported.<br/><br/>The anemic amount of Ram means you'll be reloading apps and webpages frequently, if you switch off.<br/><br/>There is no front camera and the back camera is probably a little better than expected for the money, but expect plenty of blur in anything that moves unless you have a lot of daylight .<br/><br/>As a Chrome man, I just don't like Internet Explorer on this at all, the speed of it is alright, but the interface is clunky as it gets, it's just very slow with the way they handle tabs and favorites, you constantly feel like you have to make one or 2  extra swipes to get where you want to be, like tabs or favorites.<br/><br/>Now while I sound very negative about the phone up there, remember it's all relative. This phone is 50 bucks. 50 bucks! And it's better or on par with most phones 2-4x it's price. That said I really miss Android/Ios and mostly Chrome and it's integration across devices but there isnt really any android devices on at&t;  this cheap that perform this well. So this is what will hold me over till I splurge on, probably, a Note 5.<br/><br/>In the end, with this phone being 50 there is no reason to be without a smart phone now, it may not be the best, but seeing as most people's basic needs are just messenger,FB,maps, and a browser, this thing works pretty dang well for 50. If this thing had Chrome and probably 2GB of ram or so, it would be spectacular. Interested to see what other devices they come up with in the future in this price range, because this phone raises the bar significantly.
June 1st.<br/><br/>You do not need to unlock your phone or use it with AT&T.;  Slip in an H20 Sim card, easy to do, and you can have great phone service at half the cost.  This phone is excellent, I can't see needing anything else.  Sound is excellent. And the graphics appear sharp.  When Window Phone Apps get a bit better, I do think you will see more and more people going with windows phones.  I do predict the price of this phone will go up. This is my 3 phone. Bought one just as a backup, for the price this is the best phone out their.  It makes a great tablet even if you do not wish to use the phone.  Runs off of wireless easily.<br/><br/>May 9th<br/>I  purchased a 32 GB SD card and a  unlocked code for 8 dollars.  This phone is great. It is now loaded  with lots of music and maps etc. I installed a Google Account and Facebook Account so I have all of my old contacts. The screen is great for every day apps. Plugged my USB cable into my Computer and the  transfer of Documents, Music and Pictures was easy.<br/><br/>For insurance in case this one breaks I bought another one.  All I need to do if the phone breaks is to swap out the SD Card and Sims Card and it will be ready to go. The paid for apps can be reinstalled. The Windows apps are without a doubt inferior to Google and Apple.  However there are some great apps that will certainly do the job and are daily becoming better.  Of course this is Microsoft's number one mission.  The GPS has a great receiver.  Copilot and Bing Maps are very good Apps.  The Speakers deliver enough sound to be heard well.  It works with Pay Pal here. There is really nothing lacking. When windows gets popular, and it will, you will not get a good deal like this again.<br/><br/>My first Review on Getting the Phone<br/>I like the phone. Screen looks good, its fairly fast.  Of course windows does take a little bit of time to learn.  I do not have cellular service where I live but I needed it to swipe credit cards.  Unfortunately I kept getting errors so I couldn't even download the program from the Store.  I solved the error.  It was the date and time being not correct.  The setting was on auto date. Since this is corrected through taking it off auto and setting the date and time. Everything now works, and it can now swipe cards through paypal here
I bought this phone (at a certain "Shack" - I used a gift card) about a week ago to replace an aging and defective iPhone 5S. I wasn't going to pay $650 (plus tax!) for a new iPhone 6 (I don't do service contracts or payment installment plans), and the repair costs were such that it would have just been cheaper to buy this phone than to fix the old one. I insisted on a phone with a larger screen (which ruled out my buying another 5S) and with decent battery life (which ruled out most high-end Android phones), so I looked at other options.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, I don't like Microsoft products, and for much of the time I researched phones in my price range I turned the other cheek to anything Windows-based.<br/><br/>Still, most of the devices I ended up seeing were Androids, and I didn't like them. It was always a matter of extremes with those phones - extreme size, extremely high weight, extremely short battery life, extremely low storage, extremely bad display quality - and that said nothing about software updates (or lack thereof) or Android OS-related issues (such as the SD card limitation on KitKat [version 4.4.x] and above that requires all apps, including non-removable apps, to be installed on the device's internal memory, which tends to be very limited on cheaper Androids) that made those phones much less appealing in my eyes. So, I went to Amazon and saw this phone (and its variations) at the top of the "no contract phone" sales charts. I checked out the reviews (here and elsewhere), did some research on Windows Phone OS, and bought the Lumia 635 the following afternoon, having put my faith in the fact that it was a Nokia phone (they have always treated me well), and the price.<br/><br/>The build quality of the phone is among the best you'll find in the class, in my opinion. The matte plastic shell (I'm using the AT&T-branded; black shell, but I might get the green one for a change later on) feels like, well, cheap plastic, and it doesn't handle flexing or reverberations from the device's speakers well, but it is sturdy, attractive (I like the embedded buttons), and feels nice in my hand (the angled edges make all the difference).<br/>Setup and linking of my email and contacts (even iCloud!) was easy and quick, as is navigating the phone and its features. I like the Start and lock screen customizations, the notification options, and Action Center. Messaging, Internet Explorer, and inbuilt apps (for news, weather, meal and trip planning, etc.) all work well. Cortana, itself, may be the most reliable and useful bit of "beta" software I have ever used - the updates and notifications are handy, and the voice recognition and narration are spot-on.<br/>Among the pre-installed apps, my favorite is the "MSN Health and Fitness" app. It's very similar to the "MSN News" app (which is a lot like Circa, on iOS, itself), but with the fitness tracking features of Endomondo, including workout guides, diet monitoring, and step tracking (made possible by SensorCore, an embedded, low-power, motion-tracking chip on some Nokia Windows Phones).<br/>Overall, I prefer iOS's motion-tracking system and inbuilt Health features, but Health and Fitness works well, and the inclusion of such a relatively advanced motion-tracking system on a phone of this price range is practically unheard of.<br/>You may have seen the other hardware specifications of this phone and thought that it won't work well with them, but it does. The Lumia gets 4-5 bars of AT&T; LTE almost everywhere I go, and it is consistently fast and smooth in regular operations. In many ways, Windows Phone 8.1 combines the simplicity, stability, and resource efficiency of iOS with the customisation options and system control of Android.<br/><br/>The things I like the most, however, are the call quality and battery life.<br/>The 5S (well, at least my own) was horrible in those two aspects, and the Lumia all but blew it away there. I'm no professional, and I am a relatively light user, but the phone gives me a day of usage to a charge without breaking a sweat, and if I turn "Battery Sense" on, I get two days. The 5S, on the other hand, would be completely charged by 7 o' clock in the morning and would be dropping that "20% battery remaining" notification on my screen by the time I got in my car for the drive home from work. Every. Single. Day.<br/>Call quality is also very good. Voices are occasionally garbled, and you will hear the typical hissing and crackling GSM phones generally have (can't speak about the Sprint\Boost Mobile\Virgin Mobile versions), but voices sound natural, there's plenty of volume (on both the earpiece and speaker phone), and microphone transmissions are clear as well. That's more than I could have ever said about my iPhone.<br/><br/>The Lumia 635's performance in these two factors, alone, make it worth the $50 I paid for it and more.<br/><br/>Since I'm not keen on answering questions or updating my reviews, I will mention two things I don't like:<br/>First, Windows's app store needs work. Lots of work. The most popular apps (WhatsApp, LINE, Spotify, Netflix, FitBit, Runtastic, Duolingo, YP ("Yellow Pages"), Amazon, Candy Crush Saga) will be there, and there are a handful of exclusives (mostly developed by Microsoft), but the "app gap" is real and serious. Third-party developers put in good work to provide access to apps that aren't available on Windows or aren't as good as their iOS/Android versions (such as Rudy Huyn's 6tag for Instagram [Instagram, officially, offers a beta app that hasn't been updated in nearly a year, at last check, and still lacks key features, like video playback and direct messaging] which I use personally), but the Windows app ecosystem is one you should take a quick look at before making a purchase decision, especially if you are a heavy Google product user or if you are a customer of certain financial institutions.<br/>Secondly, Windows Phone needs to "get with the program" with hardware and software support. Companies other than Qualcomm should be allowed to make processors for devices and newer Windows Phones should have higher-resolution displays. Windows Phone, itself, needs to have better support for biometric/"multi-step" security features (I miss iPhone's fingerprint sensor) and customisation options (allow users to set default apps and themes).<br/>Basically, Windows Phone should become more like Android, because trying to combine aspects of that platform with those of iOS isn't working as well as it should.<br/>Also, Microsoft had better make sure that future Windows Phones (like the forthcoming Microsoft Lumia 640-series smartphones, the successors to these phones) include the features Nokia omitted here (forward-facing camera, proximity sensor, gyroscope, etc.). Some Windows photo apps, like "Lumia Selfie" work well enough, but shouldn't be necessary...<br/><br/>My next phone is probably not going to be another Windows Phone, but that has more to do with my preferences than anything else, and that doesn't mean that this is a bad phone - it isn't. It's fast, well-designed, efficient, classy, and, most importantly, cheap.<br/>As I said, you shouldn't consider this (or any Windows Phone, for that matter) if you want the latest apps, and if you have the extra $10 to $70 to spend on, let's say, the current Moto G, get that instead. Still, for phones that cost less than that, you won't do much better than the Lumia 635.
pros:<br/>cheap price<br/>good battery so long as you are not playing games<br/>very loud speaker<br/>microphone works well, clear calls<br/>8.1 as bad as it is for a computer, is is that much great for a phone.  I tried a windows mobile phone a long time ago and hated it.  But 8.1 is good.<br/>phone appears quite durable, dropped on very hard surface, not a scratch<br/>removeable battery<br/>expandable memory<br/>replaceable shell<br/>no contract, so you end up saving a lot!!!  Use this instead of signing a new contract. Save yourself 10-15$ a month.<br/>Taking video works well.<br/><br/>cons:<br/>not many apps, and the ones that do exist are sometimes missing features and buggier than their ios/android counterparts<br/>Browser is not as good as safari or chrome,  it has a lot of issues with small links/copy/paste.  But overall its not bad.<br/>It is hard to keep screen clean.<br/>I've had a few locks up when using apps, but not many. Less than I would get with Android, but more often than IOS.<br/>Cortana can be very frustrating. Sometimes it works amazingly. And sometimes you repeat yourself 10 times each time she does the wrong thing every time.  Overall its a gimmick that  good UI could easily replace and be faster.  Hopefully she gets improved.<br/>No flash for camera.<br/>No front camera.<br/>Camera is a very weak in low light.<br/>Navigation app "Drive Here" built in is weak and cortana integration only partially works.  Ask cortana for direction, she may open your nav app, she may open the website for "directions to" the place you want to go, which then opens up a browser link to google maps.  If the nav app is opened it usually does not import the address/place so you have to close nav app, lookup address, then type address into your nav app.  Nokia removes other gps apps and puts this app on your phone.  Waze did work, but google bought them and cancelled windows phone support.  I am going to try gmaps+ to see if its any better but I don't think I'll be able to get Cortana to work with it.  Drive here does have offline maps that you can use without a data connection.  So definitely keep it around.<br/>Windows store is organized poorly. If you use a computer you see many apps that don't show up when you use your phone.  Many apps have had support turned off for most if not all phone models. So while the app is in the store, and you can see it, you can't install it.  This is because of google and apple sabotaging apps by buying out app makers.<br/><br/>Overall, I recommend the phone if you do not need a phone that plays lots of games, are not a selfie/picture junkie, and just want a nice cheap smart phone that is good enough and has an amazing price.
Lets see, WOW. I'm not going to make this all bubbly and omg WP is awesome, but how can I not? I started out with a ppc6700 in 2006, then HTC diamond, touch pro, iPhone 3, 3gs, 4, galaxy s, LG optimus g pro, LG 3, LG vista and LG nexus 5. I purchased my Lumia 635 about a week ago and let me tell you, its just refreshing. Buying such a cheap phone coming from my nexus I was worried I was "downgrading". Ha. In the last week I've realized this constant trying to keep up with the latest that I android is a mute point! Windows phone is the seemingly best kept secret publicly available and I've just caught a whisper of it. The phone only having 512mb of ram was what I was worried about initially. Once I powered it on I realized that is not the case. Their are only a few games needing 1gb and frankly I can do without them. I love Cortana. She's every bit as intuitive as google now and more actually in ways of voice command. She searches, makes calls, sends texts, asks if I want her to read texts...amazing fluidity. The OS I've realized is made to work whether you have more ram or not. Nothing freezes, navigation is seem less, the live tiles are so much more handy than android widgets. Almost all the apps I used on android were on store, and the others has suitable replacements. The keyboard is very nice. Actually better than android and as responsive as ios. It did make me happy to discover it has "Swype" functionality that is impressively accurate.<br/><br/>The battery even with my sort of use, texting, checking the news, games, lasts alll day. It's made to last all day. I can leave the house comfortably without a charger knowing my phones just going to keep battery power without being drained by that mysterious "android system". Windows was built with battery life in mind. That much shows for sure!<br/><br/>All I can say is, whether this is your first smartphone or your coming from a higher end, for the money this is well well worth it. I'm very happy and hope more people give wp and the Lumia 635 a try! I've already bought a second one for a friend in this past week I've been that impressed and confident in it. Ams by the way it is eligible for the windows 10 upgrades. You can install the preview now via the windows insider app from windows store on the phone.
This is one great smartphone and it comes at a super price!<br/><br/>At first I was apprehensive about the Nokia 635's Windows Phone operating system (having always used Android-based tablets and phones, and also being unfamiliar with Windows 8), but my misgivings have proven unfounded.  I have gotten used to the new OS quite rapidly, finding its peculiarities fairly intuitive to decipher.  I like the active-tiles feature of Windows 8.1; more practical than Android's static icons.  Only downside I've experienced so far is the apparent lack of support for Adobe Flash under Windows Phone 8.1; makes for less than complete viewing of a couple of websites I visit occasionally.  Not the end of the world for me, though.<br/><br/>I converted this phone to Net10's no-contract service right from the start using a SIM Card Activation Kit purchased from Amazon for $.01 (yes, one cent!).  The configuration and activation processes were simple.<br/><br/>The 8GB onboard storage of the Nokia 635 is adequate for a fairly substantial array of apps (from the Windows Store), but adding a micro-SD card (purchased from Amazon but not yet installed) to the phone's hardware configuration will help to support more apps as well as my sizeable collection of MP3 music files.  Screen resolution and visual clarity are more than adequate.  Touch-screen sensitivity is up to expectations.<br/><br/>I purchased a reasonably priced rubberized case and a matte-finish screen protector for the Nokia 635 through Amazon.  These have worked out well in dealing with the naked phone's inherent slippery feel and the unprotected screen's propensity to collect and show fingerprints.<br/><br/>Beyond telephoning, I mostly use the Nokia 635 for streaming music from a variety of sources via both cellular (while driving) and WiFi (at home) access to the Internet.  I have yet to break my 3GB monthly data limit in cellular-access mode.<br/><br/>So far, this phone is proving to be a champ!
Great Windows phone. I upgraded from a 520 to this 635. Faster processor supposedly a 4G LGT network where available. So far, I have not been disappointed. Rounded design comparable to the other smartphones. The 520 was square on the corners. Lighter weight. I am pleased.
Phone does not have the basic instructions on how to use camera. Instruction that came with phone are not enough to operate phones apps. This my first smart phone. Need better instruction on how to use all that phone has to offer. I know how to operate phone, that is it.
This is my first smart phone. First of all I love the go phone because there is no contract and if funding is short, I can put off adding funds or go by the minute which when on fixed income is helpful. The phone has a nice size screen for watching videos and is perfect for kindle reading. A glance and little eye movement across screen makes reading easy. The back ground has a couple settings which I chose sepia and the words pop. I am able to cosentrate well with this setting. The camera is only one sided, but close ups are amazing and my outdoor photos are beautiful. It even did well at Christmas under candle light. A five mega pixels camera makes for less camera shake. This phone takes better pics than some of the cameras I have had. The quality of picture is well worth the price of the phone. I like playing card games and the screen size is great for that. My friend has iPhone and her screen is so much smaller.<br/>If you get good reception, this phone can work as a hot spot. My reception is good as I live in the mountains, but I. Still get on linecwell at times. The plan I use is $45, unlimited talk text and internet with high speeds I<br/>On the One meg. included . One can opt for $60 plan for 2.5 Mg. It is surprising how much 1 g. Can do.<br/>I am a Sr citizen and have had trouble with quick touch on ipads. This phone is so grounded, The touch suits me well. The hardest is typing as when upright letters are small, but turned sideways it's easier to hold and the letters are plenty large for my big fingers. I am totally in love with this go phone. Use the calendar to keep organized, one note is awesome and windows compatible.
After about a year and a half of owning the <br/> the power-standby button started working only 10% of the time. That's when I realized it was time to finally switch. I didn't feel the need to move up too far in the smartphone chain, since I'm not a particularly intensive app user, although the apps I do use often make it essential enough for me to not downgrade to a featurephone.<br/><br/>I got the 635 on sale under $50 with Prime and it literally arrived the next day at my usual Seattle Locker thanks to local shipping. So far I can say I'm mostly pleased with it. My SIM and MicroSD transferred seamlessly and loading time is markedly lower than the 520 although I have to stress that this is due to the phone's age. The operating system is essentially exactly the same, so there was no hassle when it came to interface familiarity apart from setting up the app order like I did before.<br/><br/>A couple of nitpicks involve the phone being slightly bigger (although the case isn't as loose as the 520's)  as well as the face buttons now being part of the screen instead of separate. The screen sometimes loses touch accuracy when it comes to smaller buttons so I have to be careful. As I have large hands my inner palm can sometimes hit a button on the way in. I'm also disappointed with the lack of a camera button on the side for taking pictures. I'd also like to warn users who are interested in signing up for the Windows 10 Technical Preview that some apps aren't quite compatible yet.<br/><br/>All in all I'm glad I made the upgrade when I did, and at a sale price it is still a steal of a smartphone.
The reason for the five stars is that the phone is an amazing value.  It's extremely fast/low power consumption quad processor and there are many great free apps. Some websites need to get on the ball and create an app for windows phones, but there is almost always a mobile version of the website anyway. If the phone were more expensive then I would have rated 4 stars because there is no front camera and no flash.  On the other hand, the LED flash on phones only work at a short distance and they tend to leave ugly, distracting shadows.  This phone does a decent job of taking photos in low light, without the flash.  I love the way that Microsoft allow backup and sync of settings.  I purchased one of the new a 128 GB micro SD so I don't need to purchase cloud space  from anyone, I can sync with my home computer and I've got room to record all my music at near lossless quality and so many photos, are all with me, wherever I go.  I have a backup phone with a bigger camera for special occasions, like weddings or something.  I keep the apps stored on my SD, along with the music and pictures, so I can swap out my SD card, Microsoft syncs the few setting changes since last time and I'm already to go with another phone where everything, including my tiles, are all setup, just like I want them.  I don't have to shell out a fortune for all that memory, whenever I want a new phone and I won't have to crowed the outlets at the airport, because, when the battery gets old, I can  purchase a new battery for put in in my phone, 60 seconds latter.
I bought 2 of these to replace some old AT&T; Fusion 2 phones that were 1.5 years old. Keep in mind, I am comparing the Nokia to similar, inexpensive, non-contract phones.  We use H2O Wireless and can use AT&T; compatible phones.  DH & I have the same phones.<br/><br/>I have been using this phone for a few weeks now and love it! I wasn't sure if I'd like the Windows format after coming from an Android phone. I actually like it better because I can arrange the tile icons for apps by size and location to fit my needs. The app menu is also available alphabetically. The larger fonts and screen are much nicer and easier to use. There have not been any apps I couldn't get in the Windows store but check if you have a specific one you need. Not all apps are available in Windows.<br/><br/>The calls are clear and I have not had any issues with dropped calls or the inability to make calls like I did on my old phone. The speed is plenty fast enough for my needs and it gets a good connection in my building, which can be difficult to get a signal inside.  The battery life is really good and easily lasts a day or more with light to moderate use.  Picture quality is good, better than I had before, not nearly as good as a high quality phone. I use a camera for the important events so this was not a concern.<br/><br/>My phone is used to keep my life organized, stay in touch with friends, listen to music, and browse some apps. It is well worth the $50 paid and very satisfied so far!
I decided to try out the Lumia 635 just to get an idea of Windows Mobile before settling on my next personal cell phone.  I've mainly used iPhones in the past and have the original Samsung Galaxy Note.<br/><br/>For the price, this is a great device.  I already have AT&T; service so I didn't purchase Go service, just the phone.  Popped my sim card in and had no problems setting the device up, this was back in June (so two months total with device).  My only real issue with migrating to Windows OS on a phone is the App Store environment.  There were many apps I am able to use on my Galaxy Note and my old iPhone which I can't find a Windows version.  That's really my only gripe.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Cost<br/>- Live tiles are helpful, especially MyFitnessPal, Weather, etc.<br/>- Expandable memory via micro SD card<br/>- Removable battery<br/>- Upgradable to Windows Mobile 10 when it is released<br/>- Has never crashed on me<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- App Store is lacking in apps and functionality<br/>- Screen brightness only has three settings, I'd like more flexibility here<br/>- Does not have true multi-tasking.  When you close an app and switch back to it, there's a few second delay while it tries to get the app where you left off and sometimes doesn't take you back to where you left off in the app<br/><br/>I will say though, that while owning this phone, every day new apps get added to the app store.  Given more time, I think Windows OS and the devices which run Windows OS could really catch up to the competition.
Great phone for the money. It is fast and responsive and games work great.<br/><br/>Only issue is with the OS itself, there are NO APPS. Don't expect to use this phone for much more than calls, texts, music, and the internet.
Pleasantly surprised about the lightness of the model in terms of weight. It's nice and clean design without the bling.<br/><br/>The virtual buttons work fine and have found the phone not laggy.<br/><br/>FM radio works well and love having a microSD card slot.<br/><br/>The removable battery is nice although finding a replacement might not be easy.<br/><br/>Overall a great value.
I must start by saying that I am an avid Android fan. I baby my phones and finally felt that I could do away with getting insurance on my phone because I NEVER let anything happen to them. Four months or enjoying my big, beautiful Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and it falls. It cracks into a millions pieces. I still owed $700+ on it because I chose to not go with the insurance. Needless to say, I could not afford to purchase another one.<br/>I did not want a refurbished phone. I simply couldn't justify spending well over $100 on an older model, used phone. It wasn't going to happen! And then I came across this phone. It was a gamble, I've never had a Windows phone. I almost feel guilty now knowing that the phone I was previously using retailed at over $800 when I got this phone for around $50, and other than the size - it can do basically everything my old phone could. To think that I could have 16 of these phones, new, to one of my old!<br/>I'm not big on social media and selfie-taking, but one downside to someone who is - there is no front-facing camera. Withe very other phone I've had, I would religiously charge it every single night because I was afraid it couldn't make it through a second day without dying. I've gone days without charging this phone, albeit not heavily using it.<br/>Sure, I will always compare everything back to Android and my previous experiences, but for the price you simply cannot beat this. This phone is a steal!
I'm one of those people that only uses their cell phone on occasion.  I take it with me when I'm out & about, but at home (telecommuter) I use a landline.  I don't need a lot of minutes.  And I'm content with just free wifi where I find it (a lot of places have it now).  i.e. I don't need a data plan to stay constantly glued to facebook or whatever.  This phone works perfectly for me.  I use it with H2O's pay-as-you-go plan that costs $10 for 90 days.  And my leftover minutes carryover.  I can still call, text, get e-mail, FB, check my calendar, use it as a GPS navigator, play music on my car radio with bluetooth, play games, etc.  Call clarity & signal have been just fine for me (rural NC).<br/><br/>I'm also using it with Windows 10.  As of this writing, there's some minor annoyances, but they haven't officially released this yet.  Nothing is earth shattering and I feel comfortable using this phone when I'm out if I need to make calls.  One downside is that there is not a lot of storage space and you'll most likely want to get a SD card to increase it.  I was concerned with it only have 512MB RAM.  But it's been pretty snappy & responsive under Windows, even when I have multiple things open.  Admittedly, I don't play or use anything intensive.  So maybe I'm just not running into this barrier.<br/><br/>So in summary--if you're looking for a cheap phone that gives a lot of bang for the buck, this could fit your needs nicely.
<br/><br/><br/>My very lightly used ATT iPhone 4 was dying rapidly (a lot of functions were not working too well) and I needed a replacement, but was not going to get sucker-punched into another 2 year contract for a new $600 iPhone (P.S. I heard something about ATT dropping 2 years contracts, not sure how that is actually working and what the small print says).<br/><br/>I had no guarantee that this Nokia Lumia phone would work / be supported by ATT in my area, but for what I paid on Amazon, it was worth gamble. I popped the SIM card out of the iPhone and right into the Nokia Lumia, no problems. This phone uses Windows 8, so if you hate Windows 8 on your PC or Laptop (like many of us do), this may not be the phone for you. But the more I use this phone, the better and easier it looks / feels / compared to the iPhone, I'm even starting to like how Windows 8 works as an OS for phones (but don't tell my friends!). Huge amount of functions, but of course, you have to open/use a Microsoft account to use many of the features including Cortana  (iPhone Siri's deadly rival from the video game Halo). Summary: Good phone, cheap price, ease of use and tons of features. Only thing I don't like is back of case, it's a cheap snap on cover that can't possibly be water resistant much less water proof, so don't use this thing outside in the rain or out sport fishing!
Got this for my son.  His 1st smart phone.  I love the windows/xbox parent guidelines!  Set up on that is a little hard.  BUT I LOVE the security on it!  Great phone for my sons 1st smart phone and a good price too.
For a senior with no smart phone experience, this phone was easy to use and set up with its features. I would recommend this phone for all age groups. Price was very reasonable and go phone program one of the best.
I bought this for my 9 year old daughter as a media player and to stream music using Wi fi only. No cell service Works great. I'm writing this review with it. It is intuitive,and as fast as my iPhone 4s. Very nice.
This review is based on the price I paid, which was $54.  Please keep that in mind.  I was not expecting much for the price, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I'm going to start with the bad bits first, and get them out of the way.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>The build of this phone looks and feels cheap.  It is all lightweight plastic.<br/><br/>It is not very fast.  While everything seems to work on it, it is slow.<br/><br/>No Google Play.  This is obvious, since it is a Windows Phone, but it is a drawback for me, since I have music, games, and apps from Google Play that I enjoy.<br/><br/>The camera is very poor, but I'm not deducting any points for that because I knew it when I ordered the phone.  Also, the price is so low that I am just glad it has a camera.<br/><br/>Cortana is in Beta, and while I can see that it will be great, I'm not altogether happy with it.  The voice recognition is great, but I keep getting a "can't connect" message.  Since I've had no connectivity issues with any other app, it seems to be a Cortana-specific issue.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>The price.  For the $54 I paid, I could not ask for more.  It is a fully functioning Windows phone, and that is perfect for my needs.  I purchased this phone for my daughter, who has never had a cell phone.  As a starter phone, the price is perfect.  If she destroys it in a week, I'm not heartbroken.<br/><br/>Windows 8.1.  I know many people are still groaning about Windows 8, but I love it.  The versatility and ease of use cannot be beaten.  As soon as I signed her in, all of my daughter's bookmarks and accounts were readily available for her.<br/><br/>The sound is surprisingly good, with several music applications pre-installed.  I've had more expensive phones with poorer sound quality.  Since her music library from her computer was readily available, my daughter was able to begin listening to her One Direction albums very soon.<br/><br/>The pre-installed apps seem to be good choices.  MixRadio is already a hit.<br/><br/>This phone is very customizable.  This goes back to the fact that it is a Windows phone, but its value cannot be overemphasized.  My daughter's start screen is already set to her taste, with cute wallpaper and a pink theme.<br/><br/>Expandable memory is great.  I purchased an SD card with the phone, and most of the apps are already moved to the card, saving space on the phone and allowing the music from my daughter's library to fit nicely.<br/><br/>AT&T; package choices are available from $25 up.  I purchased the $45 plan, which has unlimited calling, unlimited text, and "unlimited" data.  (It slows down after 1 gb to a speed that is too slow for comfort, but that is the norm.)  I also have the option to go up or down with packages at any time.<br/><br/>Total package:<br/><br/>I am glad I bought this phone.  It is a very decent phone.  I purchased it for a child, but an adult who wants an inexpensive option could very easily use this phone for their needs.  The Windows aspect of the phone is wonderful, to me.  I am not going to trade in my $600 phone for this one, but I can see from using it that when I purchase a new phone I will be considering higher-end Windows phones. (The camera would be a deal-breaker for me.  I use my phone for everything.)  I don't think I would be as happy with it if I had paid much more, so keep in mind that this review is based on the $54 price.  If you can get it for that price or lower, go for it.
I recently purchased this phone because my Samsung S3 International did not function well here in the States.  Because I travel outside of the US, I really wanted an unlocked phone that I could use elsewhere.  This phone is locked in the USA, but can be used outside of States.  In addition, after six months of pay-as-you-go, AT&T; will unlock the phone here in the USA.<br/><br/>Value:  The phone is very functional; I am so glad I did not plunk down $600 for an Apple iphone, Samsung Android, or even the $300 for the Nexus 5.  Bottom line, this phone is a great phone for the money, unless you need to show off to the world that you're rich and like to throw money on more expensive (but only slightly better) devices, just buy this.<br/><br/>Windows 8.1:  I really love this OS.  Apple is very nice, very functional, but so is this.  Cortana works great.  The OS is very efficient, and for most human beings, Windows offers more apps than you could ask for.  Customization of Windows is far better than standard Android and Apple OS.<br/><br/>Phone:  The phone is great, pretty fast, some occasional lag, but compared to my Samsung S3, this thing blazes.  The screen is more than adequate, don't allow people to fool you into thinking that because it isn't HD, that it makes a practical difference, it doesn't.  It's basically 4.5 inches, there are more than enough pixels for you to enjoy whatever you're watching.  The camera is truly only so-so, at 5 mega-pixels it does the job, but it isn't close to what much more expensive phones can offer.  Memory is fine, Android takes up a tone of space so it needs more RAM, this phone works much better than my S3.  This phone also offers up to 128GB expandable memory, I have an extra 32GB which is more than I'll likely ever need.<br/><br/>Verdict:  Unless you're constantly taking selfies, a professional photographer who somehow uses their phone for photos, must have a non-Windows app then this phone will be more than enough for you.  At this price point, I could buy 6 of these for the price of an iphone 5C; even if the phone only lasts a year, I'm still ahead.  High-end smart phones just aren't that much better for the average daily user to justify the higher price anymore.
I have a Lumia 1020 and decided to try out the 635.<br/>Cons-<br/>-pictures taken aren't as great as the 1020 (duh)<br/>-screen is not as great as the 1020 but nothing horrendous that it's unusable.<br/>-apps are a bit slow to launch due to 512mb of ram<br/>-some games don't run on it due to 512mb of ram<br/>-Missing Glance screen (if you've never used Glance on a Windows Phone you won't miss it)<br/>-Some people will say the OS is missing apps (I'm not an app-holic so it has everything I need)<br/><br/>Pros-<br/>-Supports up to 128GB micro SD card! (BEST FEATURE!)<br/>-can install apps on micro SD card.<br/>-can install everything on micro SD card.<br/>-There are plenty of great games that will run on it even though it only has 512mb of ram.<br/>-can uninstall all ATT crapware.<br/>-Price!<br/>-Offline GPS (Here Drive app) works like a charm! (Pre-download maps in options)<br/>-Cortana (like Siri but better)<br/>-Windows Phone OS is awesome!  Super stable! Never crashes and I don't have to reboot the phone.<br/>-Kids Corner (lets you give your phone to your kids and not have to worry they will screw up your phone or buy stuff without your approval)<br/><br/>So yeah, for the price this phone is awesome!  Not high-end phone awesome but awesome that such a cheap phone can do so much-awesome.
Great budget phone. Have all apps I used in both iphone and Android phone. Received package on time and in great condition. Only thing that I would love to have on the phone is a front camera. Great buy!!!
My first Smart Phone & after a couple weeks I guess I will keep it. It is hard to break old tricks with conventional phone but this old man is qute capable & really like my decision on this phone
I didn't activate phone but use it for the internet, email and a few apps. Camera very good too. I think I paid $29 when it was a featured deal.<br/>Like having a computer in your pocket.
I purchased this phone and after using it for less than 60 days it has stopped working.  I have taken very good care of my phone and not mishandled or dropped it.  In checking with Amazon, I discovered they have a 30 day return policy so I am shopping for a new phone.  I would not recommend this phone.
. i purchased this lumia 635 as a go phone. it's a good starter smartphone. some reviewers said they were told they have to buy a data plan to use this phone. that's not true.  my previous go phone was a flip phone with a standard size sim card. since this phone uses a micro sim card, i couldn't swap my sim from the flip phone to the lumia 635. i had to get the micro sim activated.<br/>before i purchased this 635 i called att customer service & they told me i wouldn't need. a data plan & that i could keep my 10 cents a minute plan with this phone.<br/><br/>i went to an att store & they told me they can't activate this phone without a data plan.<br/>i called att customer service & told them the store would not activate this phone without a data plan.  they activated the phone for me without a data plan. they told me they would turn off my data on the phone & they also moved over the unused minutes i had from my previous phone. now i'm using this phone with my old plan of 10cents a minute & no data plan<br/><br/>the phone is easy to use & i like the speaker which is loud enough for me. even though i don't have a data plan i could still download free apps from microsoft using my home wifi.
Really like this phone. Will always use windows phone from now on.  Love how fast it is and I really like the interface.  Love I can get Xbox achievements on it with games for the phone.
I got this as a backup phone to my iphone 5 for 2 reasons.  1) in case i broke mine, 2) i wanted to try a windows phone.<br/>First thing:  you cannot compare this to an iphone 5 or 6 or any other top of the line phone.  This is a 50$ device vs a 600+$ device.  With that being said, it ran very smooth and did what I needed to do.<br/><br/>In general, i prefer iOS - the two are about the same to navigate, just different.  iOS keyboard is better IMO.<br/>Cell reception and LTE were both good.<br/>It never crashed on me. Installing new apps was easy.<br/>Syncing contacts from iphone was SUPER easy.<br/>Camera - again, 50$ device, this is a very good/solid camera for this price.  Compared to an iphone (even an iphone 4), the camera does not compete.<br/><br/>Cortana works well - just as well as Siri does today.<br/>Phone was light and felt good in the hand.<br/>Screen is very bright with colors and detail - the pixel density was lacking - again, 50$ phone.<br/><br/>Overall, ill probably keep my iphone 5 until it dies - the apps available on iOS or even android are much better in terms of availability.  I couldnt find a few apps that I wanted on the Windows Store.
Amazing that this only costs <$60.  My phone shattered, and with only a month and a half left on my contract, I needed something to get me by. I was already a Windows Phone user, so this was a natural choice.  If it weren't for the camera on this phone, I would keep it as long as I could.  The quad-core processor and WP Cyan update make this operate super fast even compared to my Lumia 920.  The battery life (with the proper battery-saving measures in place) is great.  I can go three days plus without a charge.  Probably two days with no battery saver on.<br/>Just plug in your existing (small) AT&T; SIM card and go.<br/>It has a microSD card slot, which makes the possible memory on this phone as big as the microSD card that you want to buy.<br/>My only complaint (and thus lack of a fifth star) is the camera.  It doesn't have a flash, and the resolution just isn't that great.  This is clearly the cost-cutting measure on the phone, and probably what keeps people from buying this one instead of expensive "flagship" phones.<br/>I'll be keeping this one long after I get a new phone with a good camera just in case we shatter another one in the next two years.
I like the win system very much, it is beautiful, easy and works smoothly. Although it does not have so many apps like android or ios, the apps on win usually have an elegant interface and are enough for me. The battery is good, and the machine is solid, although the touch screen feels a little bitter slow on your fingertips. Anyway, at the very beginning, I was very satisfied of the phone.<br/><br/>However, after I use less than five months, the speaker suddenly stopped work. It is horrible because I missed the alarm and several calls. It came back to work after I took out the sim card and put it away for a whole day. But after two weeks the speaker stopped work unexpectedly again, and this time I had to contact with Amazon to return it back.<br/><br/>This phone has some other small problems, for example, the phone cannot display a right time zone after three months usage. I have to set it manually. From the very beginning, the phone cannot connect to my PC by usb. But without the speaker's problem, I could tolerate it.  I understand t is a cellphone only cost me $50, but the quality still disappointed me. I really hope we could have more quality choice on win phone.
excellent , love this phone
Edited to Add:<br/><br/>I have used this phone for almost a year now and I like it even more. And having used it I think it merits some serious consideration for a daily phone.<br/><br/>The advantage of this phone is that you get REGULAR security updates from Microsoft. The only other option for you if you want regular security updates (and you should) besides an Iphone is the Google Nexus. Android security updates are bad, and here's why. The updates flow from Google (Android) to the manufacturer (say, Samsung or HTC) and then to the carrier (AT&T;, Verizon, etc.). At each new stop the urge to simply ignore things because its an old model, updates cost, are huge. Remember Android is not stock Android, the Manufacturer and then the Carrier each produces significant modifications so they can't just pass on updates because it will break things and brick the phone.<br/><br/>Not so with the Windows 8.1 Nokia Lumia 635; the flipside of a smaller Windows App store is regular security updates, less malware targeting the platform, even Apple has problems there, and a better price.<br/><br/>Also, you can use this phone as a very nice MP3 player. I bought a second one just for that.<br/><br/>Using Linux, you can mount the phone and SD Card using gphotofs, should be in most repositories; it is in Xubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr. Simply create a directory your user account has read write permissions on, and "gphotofs mountpoint_for_phone" to mount the phone. Then you can use rsync to copy your music onto the phone.<br/><br/>Using Windows, download the Windows 7/8 DESKTOP APP NOT THE METRO APP. Again, NOT THE METRO APP. You can sync your Itunes music and playlists, though I have not been able to get playlists from Itunes to sync to the phone.<br/><br/>To create playlists, either create them ON THE PHONE, not that hard; or open the phone in Windows File Explorer and right click in a directory with an MP3, create a playlist (it will be called "new playlist" -- don't rename it won't work). You can then right click on the properties and add and reorder as many mp3 files as you want. You must rename the playlist in the phone. Its a hassle. This phone is also under $40 at the time of this writing and will take up to a 128 GB card. You are also supposed to be able to create playlists on the phone with Windows Media Player but I have not been able to get that to work. I have just decided to create playlists on the phone which is easy enough to do, the screen is decent enough in terms of size for that task.<br/><br/>You don't have to activate the phone. Just sign in with your Microsoft account, and set up your apps. You get the Amazon Kindle App, great for getting all your books on the thing, and YES I have read happily Kindle books including "Day of the Jackal" while in line at the pharmacy and bored out of my skull. There are a couple of nice apps for podcasts, and you can connect via wifi to download podcasts right in the phone which is pretty neat.<br/><br/>Because its a smart phone WITH AN EXPANSION CARD it beats the heck out of the San Disk Clip Sport, with the 2,000 file limit due to the crippled mini Windows CE OS (unlike the late, great Clip Zip +) and has far more capacity than the Sony Walkman. I have free apps for an HP 12 c calculator emulator, a scientific calculator, backgammon, chess, checkers. All fun and easy to play on the limited phone screen.<br/><br/>I was able to copy all 26 GB of music and audio books onto my phone in about 2 hours using the Windows Desktop application for the phone, you should be able to google the download location (its free).<br/><br/>There are low cost accessories for the phone, I like Larcade's grip stuff and the screen protectors.<br/><br/>I HATE Windows 8.x on a laptop. Miserable. But what do you know? Everything that is annoying or frustrating on that big screen is intuitive and fun on a phone. This is a great phone, at a great price (~$50 or so) with a nice screen, at least two days worth of standby battery life if you turn off data services, and a useable set of pre-installed apps. I even put on a custom ringtone (mp3) easily with a USB cable I had lying around.<br/><br/>I like this Windows Phone better than my brothers older gen Galaxy Android phone. Yeah its not an Iphone. It makes and receives calls and texts, is cheap enough I don't worry too much about it.<br/><br/>And killer point -- it has the capacity to add up to 128 GB flash memory, so you can put oodles of songs, or what have you on the phone. No its not a selfie phone, this is a tool for grownups. You can add apps (like a HP 12 Calc app) and no the Windows store does not have the reach of Google Play nor the Iphone Store, but its a fraction of the price.<br/><br/>I hate Windows so much I run Linux on Windows 8.x laptops. And I love this Windows phone. That ought to tell you something.
I do not use this device as a phone, but find having the microSD card storage makes it very handy as a portable entertainment device.  Love, love, love the microSD option. (You do have to buy the microSD separately.)<br/><br/>It doesn't do Amazon Prime videos or Prime music streaming (no app yet).<br/><br/>I have never been able to logon to a hotspot serviced by Wandering Wifi  (the accept-our-terms initial page does not load) but other public hotspots seem to work fine.  The Wandering Wifi spots I have come across were at Panera Bread, Pilot/FlyingJ, and Books-a-Million.  Has anyone else had this problem?<br/><br/>Hulu Plus has been inconsistent for me.  It sometimes hangs and will not load the video.  Sometimes works OK.<br/><br/>I use BookVisor to read .epub formatted books but I believe there is a Kindle app (not verified).<br/><br/>I wish it had a forward facing camera for wifi video calling.<br/><br/>I gave an extra star because the price is right for what you get.  I picked one up during the Amazon $30 promotion and see that the price has temporarily(?) dropped to $40 now (Sept 2015).
Enough RAM, CPU, and (expandable) storage for my needs and then some, for $100 off contract? Why yes, please! Had this for a little over a month now, and still loving it!
I bought two of these phones (in different times within the last two months) First one, I bought at $69.99 as a replacement of my old lumia 520, the second one was a lightning deal for which I only paid $39.99 and gave to my dad (both with free shipping and directly from amazon).<br/><br/>In addition to this phone, I bought<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> as accessories and I can recommend all of them too.<br/><br/>This is not a high tech phone that has very high processing or memory capacities. Therefore anyone who is keen on fancy games or other demanding mobile accessories can stop reading this review at this point since this phone is not for you guys.<br/><br/>However for those who use phone as a phone and don't ask too much this is a real good deal. 512 mb ram is perfectly adequate for email application plus surfing the net, watching videos and many more. Windows has a good interface and those who use windows based PC at home (with windows 8 onwards) will have no difficulties in adapting. The tabs are well designed and you can find what you look for easily. Besides, neither my old lumia 520, nor this phone has caused freezing problems or other software errors. So I can vouch for the stability of windows operating system on this mobile platform.<br/><br/>The possibility to add upto 64 gb of external memory makes this phone even better than most high end smartphones in which you are locked in a preset storage capacity. I, myself, put a 32gb microSD card which made the total memory 40gb and that is plenty for me. However, you should also keep in mind that the processor is not the greatest on the market therefore putting too much in the storage will eventually slow down the machine and cause performance issues, so I would rather keep it as free as possible. Yet this is not very difficult since the 5MP camera does not record big photographs or video files anyways.<br/><br/>Another plus for this smartphone is that the battery is removable, this gives you two advantages over built-in battery models 1: When the battery is dead you can just change it and it costs you $5 (for built in battery models, when battery is dead phone is dead too).2: You can have an extra full charge battery (I keep one in my glove box just in case my battery gets flat) in case of an emergency. However, I have to say that the battery life is not great for both models. I would give a less than 15 hour life on moderate use.<br/><br/>If I may comment on the camera quality a little bit... I would say it is OK but no more. Most people just focus on the pixel count when they are evaluating the quality of a camera, yet people who are into photography know that when the sensor size is small (like in all smartphone cameras) the increase in pixel count may even decrease the image quality. Therefore, to me the 5MP capacity does not cause any problems. The main issue about the camera is that it does not have a flash and the low light sensitivity is not very good either. There is no way you can shoot anything reliable after sunset, besides indoors that don't get enough light would also suffer and generate very noisy low quality images. However outdoors getting good sunshine, you can take very good quality photos.<br/><br/>Other than the poor low light performance, the video focusing ability is also troublesome while recording fast moving objects. It frequently looses focus and wanders around. Recordings of relatively stable objects is okay though. Comparing the camera performance of Lumia 520 and 635, they  do not have much difference. Some people say 635 is slightly better but too me the difference is pretty subtle, if any. One negative mark on the side of 635 is the lack of individual camera button on the side which I used to find pretty handy while using my old 520. They totally cancelled that button.<br/><br/>So, why should you upgrade your phone if you have a 520? The only obvious reason is increased screen size and may be a slight improvement in the processing capacity (which you would not notice unless you challenge it with demanding apps and in that case both will suffer due to 512mb memory limitation.)<br/><br/>If you have a fine working lumia 520 or equal then you can skip this generation and rely on your old 520 until a new model comes out. Yet if you wish to renew it and you are looking for some improvements in your refreshment, than this is the way to go. With the accessories, the phone will cost you between $60-80 which is quite a bargain considering the fancier phones costing around 10 times more.
This phone is an amazing deal. I bought this for my wife because the phone my wife had was a piece of junk. I have to say that the sound quality is as good as any phone I have ever used. This is the first Windows phone I have ever used. It is fast and my wife has also played games on it. I have an Android HTC One which is a great phone but I can tell you that the Nokia Lumina 635 is not bad at all. The only problem with the Windows phone is that there are not as many apps available for it but all the basic apps are there. My biggest problem was setting up this phone on my ATT account. Took me forever. I suggest that before you start that you have opened up a Microsoft account and have your email and passwords ready to set up the phone. I had to start over by resetting the phone to clear out errors I was receiving. The second time around went very quickly and the apps started to download like they should. If you have lost or damaged your phone this would make a cheap replacement and you might be surprised to learn that you might not miss your old phone as much as you thought you would.
Ive always owned Android powered phones so I was little nervous when I bought but after learning it the phones amazing and for the price there are no complaints...
Its absolutely a fantastic phone especially if you own an xbox and for  such a good price. I would strongly reccomend this phone if you cant afford a fancy iphone
Cheap, reliable, interesting, and helpful assistant. Love this phone already. Not a selfie type of guy but, front camera would of been perfect for Skype at least.
This review doesn't reflect anything much about the Windows Phone OS. I personally love it, but it certainly isn't for everyone. If you are not familiar with Windows Phone, you should probably watch a video that goes over its interface and such before purchasing a Windows Phone device to see if its right for you. A great article that does this can be found on Windows Phone Central (http://www.wpcentral.com/windows-phone-81-review). My review primarily discusses the hardware as opposed to the OS.<br/><br/>This phone is effectively the "new" Lumia 520 (released last year). It is extremely inexpensive but has numerous improvements over the 520 from last year. The major improvements are the processor, the wireless radio, and the screen. With the updated Snapdragon 400, the Lumia 635 is smoother and more responsive than the 520. Besides the occasional loading screen on heavier apps (which I tend to blame on the 512 MB of RAM), I would say it runs as older flagships like the Lumia 920. It runs ga... Read more
Long-time Android user here.  Needed a cheap phone for work since they only provide me a basic flip-phone and expect me to text.  For less than $50 I got a really cool, basic smart phone.  I was kind of skeptical of the Windows Phone OS, but I really like it...not as robust as Android, but really cool in it's own way.  I don't really need a camera on this phone since I have a personal Samsung Galaxy Note 3, so I can't really comment on the camera portion, although it looks to be a very basic unit.  The external speaker is also very good.  The screen, would be, in my estimate about a 5 on a scale of 1-10, but hey, it's a $50 phone for goodness sake!  Battery life is also VERY GOOD, and I should know since I use it constantly at work at least 5 days a week, 10 hours a day on average.<br/><br/>I say if you need a cheap, basic smart phone, go for it.  I am happy with mine for what it is.  State-of-the-art, curved glass and sides, 50MP camera with quad flash, etc. it IS NOT.  But that's what's nice about it too.
Bought to use with my Consumer Cellular plan to replace a failing android phone.  Generally, an AT&T; phone will work with a CC SIM card because they use the same towers.  I just put in the SIM and SD card from the old phone, pulled the contacts from the SD, made a small change to wireless settings (easy to find instructions are on the CC website), and was up and running.  Windows interface is easy enough to master and it ties in to your home pc via your windows account. I was a bit surprised to see my desktop's wallpaper pop up on my phone.  It also has Cortana -<br/> a SIRI-like app that lets you ask it where the closest pizza place is.  As far as the hardware goes, I find the phone a bit "plastic-y" and it has some squared edges that could have been rounded  - not really a big deal.  The Nokia 635 and a Consumer Cellular plan gives you a full-featured 4G experience at bargain basement prices.  Be aware that not every Gophone model will work with CC, so do your homework first.
Great basic go phone 📞 excellent reception LTE speeds, clear screen, easy to use, glad I decided to buy it at the time I did it was under a 100 dollars
Actually, I didn't hate the phone... but I had it  less than a month in use when the power switch stopped working. Took a look, and discovered that the switch button you push to see the screen, turn it on, etc... is a cheap plastic part with a cheap plastic piece that wears out and/or breaks with use. I expected better, MUCH better, from a Nokia!
I bought this phone to replace my Lumia 925. This is a super smartphone with a super budget price. You can't go wrong..totally totally love it..
I had the phone for bout a week and it started shutting of randomly and the ear speaker and loud speaker stoops working! The Lumia 520 is way better phone than this on
I got this $50 phone to replace my Samsung Galaxy Mega that I got with my contract about 18 months ago. I was tired of having such a large phone because I switched jobs, but that was not the problem. My WiFi, Bluetooth, and GPS ALL dropped signal periodically. I live in the Twin Cities and I need thew GPS for everywhere I go so that was a serious pain, also if talking to somebody on my Bluetooth headset I would loose them about every 5 minutes for a few seconds. Also copying things to the phone would cause it to freeze sometimes.  This phone solved ALL those problems and then some. I got the Microsoft app to connect to the Mega and import all my contacts/info. GPS, Bluetooth, and WiFi all work flawlessly and plugging this into my computer with a 32 GB micro SD in it lets me copy as many things as I want (music) over to it with no problems. I love this phone and the price was awesome!
I just love this phone, for under $50 you get almost everything the expensive phones do except the camera is only rear facing 8MP which is not too bad.  If you like Windows 8 this is a great phone.  I'm used to Android but this phone is worth learning a new platform and Windows 8 is easy to use.  I just wish that more companies start making apps for Windows phones.  I love that you can download maps to use navigation even when you aren't online using WiFi.  This is a great phone to buy even if just as a back up and for $50 you can't go wrong.  I bought this because my Samsung Galaxy just stopped working and I needed something to use until I decided if I wanted the iPhone 6 or Galaxy Edge but after trying this I don't think I'll get either.  I just put my SIM in and it worked perfectly even though I have a contract with AT&T.; I'm buying one for my mom and my big sister.
I wasn't expecting a lot based on the price of this phone, but I upgraded from a Lumia 520 and the difference is amazing.<br/><br/>This phone is heavier than the 520, and about an inch longer with a half inch gain on width. It is more difficult to remove the back of the case to remove the battery or add a SIM card, but that is a good thing because the back won't come off in your pocket or from laying it down with less care than one would use with fine china.<br/><br/>The battery life is great, I was streaming videos on it for 3 hours today and it only used 11 percent of the battery, screen on brightest setting and sound all the way up. It is worth noting I drained the battery entirely prior to my first charge.<br/><br/>The processor is significantly faster than that of a 520, and it is expandable up to 128 GB with an SD card, more than I expect I will use!
I just love this phone. Will be  able to keep this for awhile. Don't even want a iphone now after having and using this for a month.
Have had it a few days. Also have a 1st generation Galaxy Tab running Android, a Playstation Vita with 3G, and a burner phone. Vita's web costs $8.33, and the burner is $6.66, which totals $15/month. Lumia wants at least $25/month, plus $5/50MB web - optional.<br/><br/>Having had a very expensive, yet under-performing Android phone (which was stolen), my expectations were low for this, my first Windows phone. Those fears were quickly abated by the realization that there are more WP apps than Android or Vita. Except for lack of Adobe Flash support, I'd give my slow Galaxy Tab away (one less thing to charge). It took hours to scroll through just the hundreds of "most popular free" WP apps, installing and spot testing 2 dozen along the way.<br/><br/>Will keep the $15/month thing for now, but once I find a WP web browser with flash support, I'll ditch my Android and burner.
I will never buy a mega over priced phone again.  At this price I don't even need to worry about buying an expensive case to protect my way over priced phone.  I had the Lumia 1020 before I broke it on accident, I had the insurance but the deductible was more then to just buy this phone, so I cancelled the insurance off my plan and started saving money there too.  There are a couple of features this phone does not have that I am missing a little bit.  The audio jack on the top, does not support a mic/headset combo or mine is broken.  The phone does not have a light auto sensing feature that adjusts the screen brightness, you have to adjust it manually which can be done from the quick tab.  The camera is not 41 megapixel, this feature was highly over rated on the 1020 anyway, so that is not a big deal.  Win8.1 OS is the best phone OS there is, period!
I desperately needed a new phone. I saw this deal and COULDNT pass it up. I even took it to Net 10 with minimal effort. While its meant for AT7T, its a no contract phone, so if you just purchase the correct sim card and activate it YOURSELF online, then you should be good to update data settings and start using your phone. The phone itself is awesome. After playing around a bit and customizing, Im thrilled with the windows phone. I also love that you can add a ton of extra storage with the micro sim card. Battery life is great (I was on speaker phone with my mother for almost an hour and half non-stop and still had 3/4 of a bar off of one charge.) My biggest complaint so far is the messaging feature. When I go to type a message, I keep randomly hitting voice input and its kind of annoying. Other than that, Ive got nothing bad to say so far!
Great phone to purchase at a very low cost and add to your family share plan.  A lot less expensive than buying through AT&T.;
I purchased the Lumia 635 (512MB RAM version) to replace an aging LG Neon GT365.<br/><br/>The AT&T; store on Michigan Ave., in Chicago, quickly and easily transferred my phone number and account information from the LG SIM (mini) to the new Lumia 635 SIM (micro).  This is a GoPhone account dating back to 2011, which has worked out well for me.<br/><br/>I have had the Lumia 635 for about a month now, and I believe it is an excellent basic phone.  I also picked up a Lumia 520 on sale (no SIM installed), and can say that the 635 is noticeably faster, and the one to get between the two.<br/><br/>Paired with a 32GB micro SDHC card, the storage is fine for my needs.  I might move to a 64GB card later on if needed.<br/><br/>Patiently awaiting the Denim update, Windows 10, and the new Lumia 640, which should be available in a month or so.<br/><br/>Have fun !<br/><br/>Don
I don't want to buy an expensive phone to replace my GS3 and look for a Go Phone to insert my sim card. These is my first Nokia Windows phone and I really surprise with it. I always use Android system like Galaxy S, S3, Tab 8.0. The W8.1 its very friendly and fast. For the price you can't ask for more. It is 4LTE phone. The camera works great i good light conditions (with a led flash will be fantastic). I use usual social programs as FB, Wapp, etc. The explorer browser works but I will prefer a Chrome or Mozilla. Excellent battery, I use it hard 2 continuous days without charging. Samsung S3 I need to charge it everyday. The LCD display its not the best but its ok for me. The Calendar its very easy and simple to use. If you're looking for a good phone without spend to much, really give a chance to these Nokia 635.
After my breaking my Galaxy s4, using another android for a while and getting SO frustrated I bought this Nokia 635 to get me through to end of my contract....and then get an iPhone 6.  (I had done the blackberry thing for years).  Well...I LOVE THIS PHONE!  I may end up just getting the latest best Windows phone when my time comes to renew.  I love the screen, MANY of the features (wish it had a forward facing camera...but I never used that anyway)...and love the Cortana.  So for $49 (Att using my old contract SIM card)....I love a phone more than the expensive Galaxy s4.  I am REALLY impressed with Windows 8.  I highly recommend it.  I have found all the normal apps I need...they have all the major ones.  And I was surprised at some others that they have.  And Amazon has plenty of accessories for it, too
I own a Nokia Lumia 630, which is the same as 635. It is just different designed codes....635 is for ATT while 630 is for Cricket.<br/>Overall this is a very good phone for a very good price. It comes with an offline GPS and bluetooth support.<br/>I used to own a Nokia 620 in the past and I can tell 630 is much better improved from the 620. It runs faster.<br/>I configured my car to pair with this phone via bluetooth and I was so surprised that the bluetooth could read out the text to me yesterday as I was driving to work. It is excellent. My Note2 didn't do that.<br/><br/>Battery is very good as well. If I do not turn on GPS and bluetooh all the times, I can survive at least 2 days before I need a charge.<br/><br/>I wish camera takes better pictures. Other than that this is a great phone.
I bought this at radio shack when they had the $10 off coupon so it was $40. i will 100% confirm this gophone is 100% compatible with straight talk. buy the micro sim kit from straight talk .com for 99 cents. go to walmart and ask them to transfer your existing number from your old straight talk phone or follow the instructions on the sim kit if you dont care about a new number. it takes usually 24 for a old number transfer but a new number is probably faster, it was also the weekend so it might be 2 hours instead of 24. to get internet to work you need to modify the data apn settings, here it is:<br/><br/>Cellular connection profile<br/>At&t;<br/><br/>Apn<br/>Tfdata<br/><br/>Type<br/>Pap<br/><br/>Proxy server URL<br/>Mms3.tracfone.com<br/><br/>Proxy port<br/>80
upgraded from a nokia lumia 520 and i really like the phone. the screen is bright, the built quality is great (dropped it a lot of times and barely has any scratch and it survived an accidental immersion in the toilet!!!) the useful apps works great although the windows phone platform is indeed more limited in this than android or ios. but i rarely use specific apps as I think most of the users. the system rarely crashes in my experience and has great resources as the here maps that gives the user to download whole regions (countries or states) to be used offline.<br/>im taking a star because the camera. besides downgrading the phone camera accessibility for not having a button for it (as it had in in 520) nokia/microsoft kept it without  a front camera useful for skype.
This phone is good for one main reason: it saves me hundreds and hundreds of dollars. At $25 a month, I'm saving at least $75 a month off a standard contract, which adds up to $900 a year. As the years go on, the savings just pile up.<br/><br/>So what about how the phone itself works? I immediately simplified the homescreen to just have people I call, the texter, and and the camera. That's just me: I like a simple phone interface. All of these features work really well, and I find the phone is a good PHONE for talking on and listening to.<br/><br/>One thing to note is that the power on/off button is on the side of this phone and a tad hard to access. Every time I fumble to push this button, though, I think of the $900 I'm saving each year and appreciate this phone even more.
Great phone, regardless of value. It IS cheap. It IS a non binding phone. It IS pretty dang good either way.<br/><br/>Pros: 4.5 inch Gorilla Glass, Qualcomm 4 core proc, expandable memory. Battery is removable and great. You can change the color for 15 bucks.<br/><br/>Cons: Camera is meh, camera button is missing, dedicated buttons are now retired from Windows Phones.<br/><br/>I got this because I didn't want anything out there now under contract, and my 920 had started to drain the battery rapidly. I needed something as a stop gap, and this fit the bill. It's faster (Im not kidding) and has native Windows 8.1 installed. No lag with the new features like the 920. I miss my camera(s) from the old phone, and the solid feel. I don't miss the heaviness and the battery drain/lag from the trusty 920. Until MS/Nokia come out with a new native 8.1 flagship, this will do just fine.
This is my first smartphone so I don't have anything to compare it to except the ones my friends use. But I think it's great especially for the price. The AT&T; folks were critical of the Windows system but it turned out that they didn't really know what they were doing. So I discount that. The guy at their store couldn't copy my contacts from my old phone so I called AT&T; and they told me what to tell the store. I went back and there was another guy and he did what I asked and was able to copy the contacts with no problems.<br/>The phone is easy to use and the GUI interface is simple.and flexible.<br/>The predictive text is very good.<br/>I have the thirty dollars per month plan with unlimited voice and text and use Wi-Fi for browsing.
Good deal and great software. I bought it for $40 so my review might be biased due to price but a great value at such a price. I love the cortana software and their speedy voice recognition and accurate responses. I have not heavily used it but I would say from my initial use I already find it superior to Google now in routine tasks like writing text and email, getting directions and checking weather. I know it lacks in apps department but you would not be disappointed if you are looking at major apps facebook, gmail, yahoo, watsapp, viber etc. There are good options there. I still feel look and feel is still childish with all the tiles navigation but it gets your work done and its just a matter of getting used to.
I bought this phone as an early Christmas present for my daughter. As her first phone, I didn't want to invest in anything too expensive. This is perfect.  I have a plan through AT&T;, so I wanted to add this as a new line rather than use it as a go phone.  All I had to do was go to my local AT&T; store to have them install a free sim card (don't use the one that is sent with the phone if you do not want to use it as a go phone).  Within 10 minutes the sim card was installed, my daughter's phone was activated, and she was good to go.  It took a little bit of getting used to as she is familiar with my Samsung Galaxy and not a windows phone, but after she had her music apps and instagram installed, she was happy!
For the money, this is a crazy nice phone. The Windows OS took about 10 min. to get comfortable with. I replaced an iPhone and I think this OS is nicer. I put in a 32GB micro card (this phone will take up to a 128GB card, I read somewhere) and that's an additional cost, but it still comes in at about 20% the cost of a similar iPhone. You can easily synch everything to everything, if you want. Easy access to all my emails, fb, yada yada. And one note: It's sold here as a Go-Phone, but no problem putting it on you AT&T; contract or whatever plan you have. I took it to an ATT store, the guy gave me the sim card, installed it, transferred all my data over from my iPhone and connected it to my plan. BAM. All free.
Great phone. Using as Back-Up number, primary use for Text Messages. Installed Windows 10 without problems.
The AT&T; Nokia Lumia is a great deal for the price.  We have one family member who is particularly hard on cell phones.  This is the prefect solution.  It has all the smart phone features that he needs, but does not cost too much to replace when lost or broken.  With a little care and patience with the Windows format, you can function just fine.  There are a couple issues that are easily adjusted to: There is no front camera for selfies and the Windows environment does not have as many Apps available for purchase.  The camera that is available for regular photos does take very nice pictures.  Some think the pictures rival the iPhone 5 photos. <br/>
Got this phone to try ouit Windows Phone, I had a Samsung Galaxy S4.  I do like that it is smaller, but I have no trouble with the smaller screen at all, crisp and brilliant.  The battery life has been incredible, I can go 2 days and I am an above average user, I have all the options turned on, location, bluetooth, wireless and more.<br/><br/>I have a 3rd party bluetooth system in my car, no issues connecting, the Cortana function is fantastic, I can receive, she reads and I can respond to texts without my hands leaving the steering wheel.<br/><br/>For a low end phone it is incredible, you can use as go phone or if you have your sim card you can use it as a contract phone.<br/><br/>Just love it.
I love this phone. Nokia's always make a quality product but don't always get the love associated with it.
Wife loves it, Windows phones are so much better than Androids-and will only get better with Windows 10!
A nice cheap Windows smartphone.  Better than the 520 because it came preloaded with Windows 8.1 (previous one was upgraded), and so I seem to have fewer issues with the battery running down, etc...  Has been quite reliable so far.  I also like the lit up search, back, and home buttons (again, unlike the 520).  This does all make the phone slightly bigger than the 520 (although the same amount of information is shown on the screen)<br/><br/>One thing missing is a shutter button (on the 520, this could bring up the camera application without having to type in your pin).  Sadly, this feature isn't there on the 635.<br/><br/>For the price paid, I can't really complain much at all!
I like it but I think it will take some getting used to before I can say I love it. If you are use to Windows 8.1 then you should have no problems with this phone. I like the android play store better at this time as I haven't been able to load some of my apps to this phone. Also this phone is locked to the AT&T; network. I discovered AT&T; will unlock it but only after certain conditions. The Go Phone is AT&T; answer to Prepaid service and if you check, to me is quite expensive. If you don't activate the service the phone works on WiFi just like a 5.5 inch tablet. Many of the installed apps work the only thing is you cannot make or receive phone calls. GPS works and so do the maps.
I'm writing this review after owning this phone for 4 months.. you can't beat the price for the features this phone is offering..<br/>Metro ui is awesome<br/>Front screen can be customized  as we like<br/>Decent app store (not great as android or ios)<br/>Free offline maps<br/>SD card support upto 128 GB<br/>Apps working flawlessly from SD card<br/>Tons of features & shortcuts in settings which not known<br/>Controlling xbox via phone<br/><br/>I liked the phone and some 5 of my friends also bought after seeing mine.. it's serves well as a backup phone for them.. I'm using it as primary phone and liked it..<br/>Thanks microsoft and Nokia for this wonderful product
There are numerous reviews about cons, such as no front facing camera and the like. So I'll concentrate on some positives. 4G/LTE, nice screen size, not too small, not too big. In my opinion, just right. Loud speaker during calls or playing media. I very seldom have to use speakerphone, since it's really loud without it. I keep the volume on 15. The sleek black screen look, when in standby. Gorilla glass. Quad core processor. Fast. Side buttons, least likely to be pressed by mistake. Everything has cons, but Amazon's asking price for this phone certainly is hard to pass up. I KNOW this phone is worth more. Because THE PROS definitely outweigh the cons. I purchased two. Because I wanted an extra battery. But the Whole Phone was a few bucks more. So now I have an extra battery and phone.
I bought this phone because I wanted another that I couldn't afford. This phone takes some time to get used to from Android (what I'm used to). But its great. For a not so expensive phone, it really is a nice phone. I love it, I'm glad I bought this phone. Haven't  had any problems since I bought it two weeks ago. This goes by Windows so the apps come from there, which I had no idea since I'm not all that great with technology. But I know the basic things. It has the facebook app, instagram. Pretty much everything (almost) that Android has. Just different operating system. If your funds are low, but you want a smartphone that isn't basic, get this. It's perfect.
The basic features work great, including the GPS driving directions.  The display is good but dim at medium brightest and has no auto-adjust.  Turning up the brightness would make that better, but I did not test it.  The is no front camera and the rear camera is mediocre.  All the software works great.  The OS is very fast and has lots of features.  Battery life is great.  The no-contract price was a completely unbelievable $30.  The OS and all the basic software like MS Office and maps take up less that 4 Gigabytes.  That leaves 4 Gigabytes for music making this the best value MP3 player ever.  If you need more space, you can add any SD FLASH card made.
UPDATE Dec, 16 2014<br/>I've used this phone for over a week now and I still love it. It has lots of features and is very user friendly. If you are knowledgeable of windows operating systems, then you will like this phone. For the price I would put up against any other smart phone. Even up against the high end Apple, Samsung and others that are so over priced. This phone has all the same features and bells and whistles. Battery life is good as long as you turn off Wi-Fi only as you need it. Otherwise it is constantly searching for a signal. You can turn on and off other items as you need them. I hope this helps anyone looking to buy this phone. ENJOY
great phone for the price at least I get my calls, more then I could say for my Amazon Fire phone.
This is a great phone. Especially for the price.  Pros - Very responsive. Easy to use. battery lasts a long (1.5 days for me).  Cons - no front camera, cannot install some aps. ((My bank app , (but I can use the browser to go on line and check my acct)., my Vivofit app, and some other stuff but no real biggie)). One thing for sure, this is dependable and the battery life is longer than others phones I have used. I returned to this phone after using two other phones that were androids.  Boo!  They just fell short in many places.  Craved coming back to this Windows phone.  I dont recommend for Apple users but, for windows users I highly recommend.
I bought this on a Daily Deal for $29 and am just amazed at what a great little device it is. I have a company-paid iPhone 6+ that I love but I wanted to see what this would be like as a very inexpensive micro-tablet (i.e., I didn't sign up for cell service, just using the wifi) . Bottom line: it's really great. With email, Twitter, Facebook, Camera, and Skype you've got a little $30 computer. Would make a great gift for a kid not yet ready for her own cell account - and I think 9-1-1 would still work in an emergency. Or for someone who could only afford this as their digital device. Or for its intended purpose lol. Anyway, my first review!
It's a very nice phone. Very fast, snappy, and easy to use. I'm really happy with it so far.
I bought this phone for the Bluetooth as that feature on my Lumia 1520 has stopped connecting with several of my devices.  I thought I could use this phone to fill in for music, fitness band, etc.  But this phone is having the same problem as my 1520 -- pairing, but not staying connected, so it's useless to me.  It might be a recent software update because I've had my 1520 almost two years and just started having this particular problem.  When searching the problem online, I see it's a pretty widespread problem.  If Bluetooth is not important to you, aside from the phone getting hot quickly, it's a good deal.
Got here a day late, but I really like the look and feel of this phone. Windows 8.1 is pretty cool and customizable, but the app store and UI for new Windows phone users is rough. Battery life, photo quality, and functionality of this phone make it a steal at three times this price. So fast and clean, just need some more help getting in the hang of Windows. When I went in to activate it today on my ATT but apparently I had phone insurance so I am upgrading to a Note4 for 150$ but I am definitely keeping this phone, at the very least as a backup for my girlfriend, and interested in more Windows products.
Such an awesome phone for the price, this phone performs absolutely incredible, i love it.
Good for a budget smartphone. I got this specifically to test the Windows 10 preview on.<br/><br/>None of the features about this phone are that spectacular, but it's pretty solid for being only $50 (as of this review). It unfortunitely only has 512 MB of RAM, which limits some of the software it can run, and it lacks a front-facing camera but it does have LTE and the phone's build feels solid (no creaking or loose plastic). It doesn't have much onboard memory, but it supports a micro-sd card expansion. Unlike many phones these days it also has a replaceable battery, which is welcome.
Very pleasantly surprised by what a good, feature filled phone this is.  It replaced a Nokia 920 and other than a no frills camera and no selfie camera or flash I like it better.  I even find the info lady "Cortana" useful tho I have derided other phone info people ( Apple Serie).  It has good reception, reasonable battery life and comes loaded w/ useful apps. For a tech challenged old man I find it intuitive and quite easy to use, tho previously having a windows phone helped.  I would not hesitate to recommend this phone and consider it a bargain considering its' initial cost.
I purchased this phone because my wife and I purchased 2 Nokia cell phones in 2000. I lost my phone about eight months ago and because it had worked so well for 14 years, I purchased this Nokia Lumina 635. It has the Windows 8.1 operating system. It works so well after I learned how to use it that I bought one for my wife. So far I am very happy with the phones except I keep getting a time that tells me to sync my contacts which is very irritating and nothing that I do are read about helps me to get rid of it. So far online no answers. I still rate for four stars.
Love all the Windows Phones (the OS is simple, fast, intuitive, and by far my favorite after using iPhone and Android devices). The Lumias are particularly great, and the Nokia camera apps are awesome. No glitches, no freezes, and no system issues. The phone is super slim and lightweight, and the build quality is nice. My only gripe is that the camera doesn't have a flash - if you're looking for a similar phone with flash/nicer camera, the Lumia 822 or 900 and up series are really great.
I purchased this phone for my son as a gift. He loves it and keeps thanking me. It has a nice size screen, Long battery life, he likes the fact that he can get games on it that he can't get on his tablet and that its pocket sized ,lol. And that it has its camera on the back side of it unlike his table cam on the front side . and it only takes a few mins for the games to download. And it doesn't freeze on him and the screen doesn't act<br/>Funny if smears are grease are on it , lol. He is only 12yrs and this is his review . :-) He is very Happy :-)
I was skeptical about this purchase but as a person who loses phones regularly, I thought to give it a shot.  Turned out to be a surprising delight.  Smooth, easy to use, fast, and no problems.  Video streaming was great, wifi excellent.  You name it.<br/><br/>2 things might factor into a decision not to get this phone:<br/><br/>1. Windows phones just don't have the apps many of us will want.  Sticky matter.  2. The camera is merely rear-side so you can't Skype or video chat properly.  Bummer.<br/><br/>For what it is, it's a fantastic deal.
I still can't believe I got a phone with all these features for only $50.00 and no contract. I use it as a go phone and pay around $7.00 / month for service. Of coarse it's only a smart phone when I'm near a WiFi connection since I don't have a data plan but it works perfect for my needs. Maps can be easily downloaded for navigation so that no data plan is necessary for traveling. Battery life kicks ass, I typically have 30% battery remaining after 3 days of normal use. Windows Phone is a sweet OS as well, I like it much more that Android OS.
Not a bad phone for the price. Works very well with Blue Tooth. Instructions are non existent, you just have to play around with it. Hoping Windows 10 will be offered for this phone to get rid of Windows 8.1. Getting back cover off was a little pain. Best to view on You Tube a video actually showing how to remove cover, insert SIM Card and install battery. Phone charges fast with charger it came with. Registering and loading the phone with GO Phone Card was easy enough. Being hard of hearing it would have been nice if ring tones were louder.
Surprised how much I like this phone. Longtime blackberry (including Torch) and iPhone (4S, 5S) user, and I think I actually like the Windows operating system better. Really the only downside to this phone is that there are far fewer apps available; the biggies are here, but suggest you check the windows store if there's an app you must have (Uber has Windows app, Lyft doesn't, for example). Long battery life. Does take quite a while to fully charge if you're getting low (hint: put in airplane mode to have it charge at least twice as fast).
This phone is well built. Nokia phones are always the best build quality phones.
This is a GREAT phone for the money, it does everything. I don't know how they can sell it soooo cheap, it's a pc in your pocket. The only bad thing is no front camera or flash and and doesn't  blink as the Z998 does when you have any activity on the phone. I had a Nokia 520 and that was a great phone too, I still use it once in a while. I miss the tap screen the 520 had and the 635 doesn't. I guess for the money they can't give you everything on the 635. If you want a great buy for the money try the Nokia 635, you won't be sorry.
I have had this phone for a few months now. The first thing I did was my 64 GB flash storage device to increase my internal storage. I love this phone it is simple to use, finding information to perform task that I do not know is easy to find.<br/><br/>Cons: no front facing camera. I actually almost did not buy this phone because there is no front camera. I wanted to be able to use Skype or WebX but with out a front facing camera it makes is much harder to do.<br/><br/>Add a front and back camera to all your phones please.
I bought two. Replaced my 520 with one and keeping other as spare if my wife's 635 were to die (she must think phones love to swim). Seems as fast as my older broken 920, but of course the photo's are not as great, but the SD card slot works wonders! Some apps in the new Win8.1 after the updates can install to the SD card, others refuse to...but overall that will save me a lot of space on the phone. Glass smudges, but doesn't feel like the cheaper glass on a 520, but not as nice as the 920 screen was before I shattered it.
A great phone for very little money.  This, and a few other devices that have hit the market recently (like the Moto E 2nd Gen), have the power of "Good Enough".  This phone can do everything you need, plus keep a few hundred dollars in your pocket (approximately $600 for a new iPhone).  You are also not beholden to a wireless carrier for a contract or set number of payments (probably the best feature).  The only drawback to this phone (and the Moto E) is the camera - both are just OK/average (and have no flash).
My wife is using this phone with 10 cent/minute plan. Unfortunately, the plan can't use internet from smartphone. That is clearly stated in the att plan website. Other than that, she likes it. Instead, she can use free internet through wi-fi. Windows OS looks pretty good and the camera works fine. Her old sim didn't fit to the new phone and we called att customer center (the number was given on the back of the phone) and they asked sim card number to activate the new one with her old account. It's done very quickly.
This is the cheapest smart phone available. I switch to this after breaking a blackberry, loosing an iPhone and frustrated by the high prices of Google phones. There are few apps missing but there are substitutes. The ability to insert an SD card is hue, you instantly get 32GB. The browser is a bit strange, you can always go back but it doesn't give you the ability to go forward easily. Nevertheless great smart phone for $40. I am using it with ATT. THIS IS NOT A GO-PHONE ONLY YOU CAN USE IT WITH YOUR FAMILY PLAN.
Nice smartphone!  Why pay hundreds of dollars for the "other" phone?
It runs on the internet better then the 520 but kicks me off sometimes. I like the lock screen for the kids corner better then the 520, you have to dial 911 rather then just touching emergency call. My kids called 911 more times then I can recall on the 520. I do not like the in call screen it constantly puts people on mute and speaker really frustrating, this didn't really happen with the 520. I switched because my battery was shot and I couldn't  find the replacement. The 520 is a bit thinner as well.
This is a spectacular phone. I'm loving it. Give it a try. It's no Iphone, but, I'm not paying 10 times as much.<br/><br/>I'm not one of those who hates windows just for the heck of it. I like Win8, and the common interface they have across windows devices. Microsoft may be on to something here.<br/><br/>Just to give some perspective, I'm from Unix world and I hated android phones. And the thing that prevented me from buying IPhone is cost. They are remarkable, I just don't have that kind of dough.
well worth the price, you can do as much as high end Smart phones, the camera is not great, but work every time. not very fast chip, but there is no complaint here, it's 10 to 12 times cheaper than  the high end phones. will buy another when this wears out.<br/>I just used a plastic pocket, no need for protective covers or expense cases, as a matter of fact it's cheaper than a case. I would encourage people to abandon android or I phones and choose windows phones for now. You have nothing to lose.
With the Lumia 640's recent price drop at many stores, prefer the Lumia 640 to this 635.  For roughly ~$40 more, the 640 brings:<br/>* 5" vs. 4.5" screen with noticeably higher resolution.  Text is sharper and colors more vivid.<br/>* The 640 has a flash for the rear camera (8 MP vs. 5 MP on the 650 and a front-facing camera.  With the 640 I can video chat and picture quality is passable.<br/>* 1 GB RAM vs. the 635's 512MB.  Makes a significant difference in day-to-day performance.
I have been very happy with this phone for the price. I was using an unlocked Tmobile phone on att and had spotty reception after purchasing this phone it has improved significantly. I just transferred my sim card and the phone worked right away. This is my first time using a windows phone and so far I am happy (used for about 1 month now). I am not very tech savy and use my phone mainly for basic tasks (call, text, email, some internet use) and this phone has worked very well so far.
Good phone to get you by until you can afford an actual good phone. Lol
This is a really great phone for the price. My flagship phablet broke so I picked one of these up until the Next Best Thing gets released. There are a few things that the 625 doesn't have that I am used to on other windows phones: front camera, LED flash, physical camera button. But for $50 it's hard to beat. The UI is still fluid, and the SD card slot resolves any storage issues. Maybe the 512mb RAM is a weak point, but I'm not a big phone gamer so that's not an issue for me.
Okay, bought this phone for my 12 yr old. He looked it up, then I checked it out. Rated the best phone under $100. No front camera but neither he nor I cared. This phone is amazing. He played games (so clear), facebooked, youtubed, (very loud too) for over a day before even caring about minutes, then forgot again about minutes. All of us love talking to it. To him this phone is better than his tablet and computer and his big brother are thinking about changing theirs.
Don't forget to check out  youtube videos for this one or any other phone. You can watch tons of videos to feel more comfortable with whatever phone you buy and how to use it.  For this phone i entered in the search box, "nokia lumia 635 how to"  .. and you'll get tons of choices to view. I think watching these helps me feel more comfortable with a new product I'm buying or viewing how-to for dummies.  Also use http://microsoft.com/mobile/support  .
Great phone.....great price......95% as good as phones that cost $600 plus.  The 4G LTE on AT&T; averages over 20 Mbps down and 6 Mbps up in our area.  Very happy and I can do internet sharing with other devices anytime there is no WiFi available.  It's a terrific phone for a very affordable price.  I have everything on it backed up Microsoft's Cloud and they gave me 30 Gig of storage for free.  Very cool.  Note: Apple only give iPhone users 5 Gig for free.
When I saw that this phone will run the new Windows 10 out this summer I was thrilled. Nice phone, easy to read and hear with, and it runs a long time on a single battery charge. My wife like it far better than the iPhone she had and was amazed at how much power you get from such an inexpensive cell phone. You can spend $600 to buy a fancy phone with the right label on it or a tenth of that for a great phone that works fine. The choice is yours.
Excellent phone for the price!<br/><br/>Windows OS is fluid, battery life is incredible and the fact that AT&T; unlocks for free was a no-brainer (even for non-AT&T; customers)....<br/><br/>Also has offline HERE GPS maps - great little GPS unit for the price on top of being a mobile phone...<br/><br/>I actually like the Windows Mobile OS - only cons of the phone are lack of front-facing camera and flash but definitely not a deal breaker...
I like the phone, it has a lot of features, some of which I'll never use. Downsides, I can't get my outlook calendar to synch (probably my fault, but it should still be easier), The touch "buttons" activate when I'm talking on the phone. The most annoying is the mute button activating when I'm talking and then I find that person hung up because they couldn't hear anything. I'll figure out something to fix it.Other than that I like it.
The product has met my expectations,  thank you guys very much :)
This phone has proven to be a very good buy so far. I am pleased.
Windows 8.1 is a delight to use. Cortana also provides lots of local news. Getting a choice of which news to review is also a nice touch. The phone works well as a phone. There are tons of apps (more than I will ever need). The camera does a good job and the pics that you take are presented as a slide show in one of the windows on the screen. Keyboard is a bit tight for big fingers, but the erase key is handy for the goofs.
The OS and software is great. It's a fantastic budget/starter smartphone and kind of gives you the best bang for your buck. This phone not being high-end, it does lack things like a front-facing camera and LED flash. It was made before Microsoft acquired the mobile division of Nokia, so some of the new low-end smartphones like the Lumia 535 have some added features like more RAM, a front-facing camera, and LED flash.
Great smartphone for the money though i don't use as a phone.  purchased on black friday of 2014 and get online with wi-fi only.  added a 32 GB sd card but can take up to 128Gb.  use the phone to get on facebook, sell things on Ebay, read news and sometimes books, as music player, web browser, and camera.  With an hour or two of use per day I charge it about once a week. Can't beat it for the price in my opinion
Considering the price on this phone, I couldn't be happier.  I was able to grab it for 29.99.. Off of contract!<br/><br/>You can't find a camera for that price, key alone an entire phone running Windows!<br/><br/>Also the windows on here is really cool and fast. It may not be android or iPhone, but it is so cool.  Some apps are missing from the store like snap chat, but I found just about everything else.
This is the most user friendly phone Ever!!! It actually does almost everything for you. You can even speak your text messages! It has a microphone almost every where and a very helpful sidekick "Cortana" that takes your voice commands And Talks to you, making sure that your commands are correct. This is an unbelievable handheld computer, not just a cell phone!!! Operated by Microsoft Windows.
For the price, quality is excellent.  My first smart phone, so I'm still figuring things out.  So far I'm happy with my purchase, especially love the camera.  Haven't had any issues with the lack of flash.  Biggest issue is AT&T;'s customer service to help switch from a basic messenger phone to the smartphone sim card, but that is no fault of Amazon's.  Would buy this phone again and I do recommend it.
This is a wonderful phone for anyone who is a fan of Windows Mobile platform. The screen display is awesome, the battery lasts quite long (I admit I am a light user though) and the price is the cake and 'no-contract' is the icing on the cake. I was a old AT&T; user from a time they offered $25 voice plan for 3 months, so continued it on this phone. The phone has absolutely given no problems so far.
Phone seems nice but watch out if you don't want to use it as a Smart Phone. I tried to just transfer my SIM card to a new phone but ATT requires a data plan if the phone is capable of one (even if you don't use it).  I wanted this to replace a basic phone for our son that he uses for emergencies only. Not happy with forced data plan. Asked them to take it off or block it, but they won't.
It's an ok phone for the price but one thing I did not check out when I bought it was Nokia 635 Speaker Volume is low even at the highest 10.<br/>Since it was not expensive and no contract I am keeping it.  The first two calls I got when I bought it I never heard the ring...I found a ring that sorta<br/>is loud enough for me to hear but if low volume bothers you try a different phone.
i brought this phone a week ago and i would have to say it is worth every penny you pay for it. In my opinion it operates wonderfully for an entry level smart phone. the speakers on it sound good. the touch screen perfect. the camera takes ok photos.  battery life is one to two days at mild use. the only thing this phone lacks is a flash for the camera.  i would recommend this phone.
A simple phone for simple needs. This phone has what my sister needs...a way to make phone calls, read emails and texts, and the basic needs of a product like this. It is cute and handy, although it is not up to date with the "selfie world". Lacking the front camera makes it less attractive for younger people, but luckily...my sister is not that young anymore, so no problem.
I originally purchased this to be able to use on Tracfone with the BYOP Program. I realized that I had bought the wrong one when Tracfone asked me if my phone was unlocked. I plan to sell the one I currently have and buy the unlocked version of this phone. Even so, the phone worked great for my needs. I was even able to try the Windows 10 Phone beta on it and it ran like a charm.
Cracked my iPhone 4s and had to find a replacement. I bought this phone and got it hooked up to straight talk. I believe this to be on par with the 4s- as long as app selection and selfies aren't topping your list of must-have phone elements.<br/><br/>Got it for $55 unlocked, and I pay $46 a month for unlimited everything. I'm not sure you're going to find a better deal.
I would have given it a five stars but it won't allow me to download my music from my Amazon cloud player without a PC or an Xbox and can't get the Amazon music app. My PC is broken and I don't have a Xbox so I guess I have to buy an Xbox or PC for this to happen....other than that its a great go phone. Lots of other great features and I got mine for a real good price 😉
So far so GOOD! I have had trouble with cellphones in the past so I don't want to get too happy. This is the best Windows phone I have ever owned, I had other brands of Windows phones but I guess there is no substitute for the real thing and Nokia is the REAL DEAL.  If you are looking for a phone that is compatible with Straight Talk then this one is for you.
After 2 days of regular use, I think I might be here to stay.  I got it as a toy phone to mess around since I am a tech head.  I use an iPhone 6 up till now.  For the price, the value is pretty significant.  The features are all there.  You can argue that perhaps the apps are not all there for the WP but I've not found anything significant missing so far.
It's greatexcep extept  I was under the impression that it was capable of upgrading to<br/> 10 immediately. 8.1 is not owned by google so we are good.No contract att phones work anywhere with wi fi all the time. You don't even have to activate it. Open package, insert sim card, and log on to internet at your fav wifi hotspot for free. What could be better???
Great device for the money.  Only wished I would have waited a couple of weeks to buy it for my son as Amazon had a sale 2 weeks later and I could have saved $20 bucks.  Besides this, its a great buy and my 10 year old loves his windows phone...gave me back the iPhone 4 he had and told me he never wants to see that phone again...lol.
Needed a very basic smartphone to get me through the end of my contract. I don't care for anything fancy and high tech but I was afraid this was going to die right away. I was pleasantly surprised! It very well build and was easy to set up. It has the basic functions of a smartphone and is enough to get by, especially for the cost!
I love everything about this phone! Its FAST, it has so much memory with room for more. It sports a nice big screen with slim design. Its easy to use, easy to update and fit with hundreds of apps. This phone is replacing a google phone which I cant wait to smash into a million pieces when I finally get my service transferred over!
I was a 38.??$ discount when you bought it.<br/>Although the first bounce once on Amazon was able to resolve the live chat.Very Thanks to kind by Amazon agents Mahadevan.<br/>Price is satisfactory thing. Discounts once again If i am willing to repurchase.<br/>Regret did not buy a screen protective film and a case together !!!
I love my Nokia Lumia 635. Its fast and sleek making it unqie and way better then my past android phone. And the OS is the most original design, and feature I have seen in a phone and I love it! It does what it advertised and more, while not to disaponint me! For sure the next phone I'm getting in the future is a Windows Phone!
Beautiful low cost phone. Bought this for my husband as his first touchscreen smartphone.  It was a bit of a learning curve for him, but he's picked it up quickly and has begun adding his favorite apps easily.  You don't have to have a phone plan for it at all, just use it on wifi for the apps/ease of access/mobility features.
I love it better than iPhone and cost effective
For the price I will not buy another smart phone. Win 8.1 takes time to get used to but it does everything I need from a phone. If you think you can be patient enough to learn windows 8.1 buy this phone, its well worth it. Unless there is a newer similarly priced version out soon I will be buying this again if need arises.
This phone will get you from point A to point B. The app support is a joke, but it's a very inexpensive phone for what it is. The windows phone UI takes some getting used to but the phone itself is sturdy and dependable. Good battery life. Had this phone for over a year before I decided it was time for an upgrade
This is used as a replacement phone for the landline with H2O pay as you go $10 plan. To my surprise, I actually like it. As a phone, it gets better sound quality than my HTC M8 and verizon fios landline. The UI is really nice and intuitive. I will seriously consider a WP when the current contract is over.
Like it for the most part, my first smartphone, but has its faults: screen rotation very schizy; best not to count on it at all. Speakerphone doesn't have enough volume headroom. Fragile; it can shatter if dropped on a hard surface- my first one did. Order a flip cover with it. Decent for the price.
i like this phone.it's cheap and practical.
Hello I bought Nokia and I was pleased with it the shipping was fast and the phone was very worth the money. If your trying to spent less on a phone the gophone is right for you. I have 250 minutes and unlimited text for 25 a month. I gave it a four star because it doesn't have a front camera.
This phone works great no problems and all apps are just what I needed.  Cortana is great helps to keep me on track for appointments and important special events as well as quick responses to various questions.  4G LTE from AT&T; is fast and I receive a good signal from the cell phone towers.
NEVER wanted a smart phone.  Needed an inexpensive replacement for my "dumb" flip phone.  Had AT&T; put this on our account and LOVE the phone.  Paid $30 on sale and it is well worth it.  Not using it as a "Go Phone" but may actually switch to than rather than our AT&T; plan.
good value but casing could be made better. Don't care for the outer shell being needed to operate the volume and power buttons on the right side.<br/><br/>Windows phone 8.1 OS is good even though my daily rider is iPhone 6. I like the physical screen size and the battery life as well.
this is the end all be all of affordable phones! It does everything you need it to do and does it well. the only thing it lacks is a front facing camera, to me that's no big deal. with the gophone no contract deal it's a no brainer, no contract, att fast speeds. Dont hesitate get one.
This phone cost about $20 more than the avail 2, and some other phones. The quality of this is like going from a regular car to a Cadillac.It works so easy,and has far more features,than one would want,and more than you'd expect from a phone at this price.Try it, you might like it!
I really like the phone for the battery life. Once the power saving mode is on, only single app is allowed to run at any time. In that mode, the phone is very fast, cool and the battery lasts a long time.<br/><br/>The phone does not sync up time with the carrier for some reason.
Great functionality for the price! The device feels nice enough, and the screen is responsive and accurate... can't be the value. I used this phone with Cricket Wireless with no issues, but it would be worth it just for the device with no SIM card activation at all.
Great phone. With mobile hotspot there are endless possibilities.we use it to wifi to our tablets. Stays charged for days even with constant use.easy to use phone. Easy access to my favorite apps. Definitely recommend to all my friends, and we love using Cortana
Hmm a $50 phone what am I thinking right? Perhaps the best phone in its category. Very sleek and did I mention the battery life, features and its only $50.<br/>Cons: No flash, windows platform (app store)<br/>pros: $50, battery life, wifi, 4g LTE, Bluetooth
I would like a better camera, better screen and more RAM, but for the money this phone can't be beat (unless you value availability of certain apps over good build quality). It has a gorilla glass 3 screen, a quad core processor, and great battery life.
Just got this phone and I think it is great. Sharp and fast, very easy to migrate from Android, though the Windows App Store is a little lacking. If it wasn't for losing a few nice apps I would have gone 5 stars, not sure if I can blame it on the phone.
Great phone for the price.  Windows phone is actually a good product and complements a strong windows 8 and office 365 user.  Unfortunately the app selection is too deficient for me but that does not change the fact this is the low cost phone to beat.
I Loved my At&t; Lumia 520 so much I went ahead and bought its bigger more powerful sibling the 635 and am not disappointed at all, the smooth and fast quad core processor is a big plus. Cortana is great, its everything I liked about the 520 and more !
I recently bought a 635 after owning a Lumina 520 for two or three years.  The 520 started acting funny and decided to replace it and bought an Iphone 4s.  My daughter just got an Iphone 6 and WOW!  she paid a lot of money!  She convinced me the Iphone is the way to go what with all its features, especially SIRI  the virtual assistant.<br/><br/>I was familiar with the Virtual Assistant feature because the Windows phone (the 520) has CORTANA in its system. While using the 520 I found CORTANA quite handy.  Comparing CORTANA  WITH SIRI I found them to be pretty even in their capabilities.  No doubt the Iphone is a terrific device BUT the price tag is huge.  The Nokia 520 came from an ATT store and I paid $100 for it.  I just bought a 635 from Amazon for $40 and the bottom line is that either one of those Nokia phones will stand up to an Iphone as far as I am concerned.<br/><br/>The 635 does not have two cameras...big deal.  I'm not into selfies.  But there is an app for the 635 that facilitates making selfies at the huge cost of 99 cents.  In my opinion the Nokia phones have a big advantage over Iphone because if the battery has to be replaced the back of the phone can easily be removed and the battery replaced.  Not so with the Iphone. My daughter had to take her Iphone to the Apple store for that.  Also, the Nokia 635 and the old 520 has a slot for an SD card which can expand the phone's memory beyond that of the Iphone.<br/><br/>CORTANA & SIRI:  They are pretty much the same in my experience...BUT if you are like me and drive quite a bit on the highway, or just around town, CORTANA and the Nokia 520 and 635 have a feature that SIRI does not have.  Both phones can be paired with a bluetooth system in my vehicle.  While driving, if I receive a text, CORTANA announces I have a text and asks me if I want to read it, or ignore it.  If I have her read it, she then asks if I want to reply.  If so, I can dictate the reply to her and send it, all by voice command. While using an Iphone, I tried six ways from Sunday to find settings to get SIRI  to do the same thing.  That function is not built into an Iphone.  That feature is a safety factor with me and it should be built into all cell phones in my opinion.  I keep both hands on the wheel and my eyes on the road making/taking calls and texts with CORTANA.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, an Iphone is an excellent device.  If you wanna spend the same amount I pay every month on my car payment....go for it.  The Nokia 635 has the same functions and more thru CORTANA and is a lot less expensive (not cheaper).  Bottom line is, the Nokia 635 is a terrific phone with lots of bang for the buck!
This is a surprisingly nice phone for the money.<br/><br/>I have had many phones over my smartphone career. My first real smartphone was an iPhone, but since then I've been using various Android phones and most recently a Galaxy S6. I chose to leave Verizon in favor of Cricket, and decided I would like to try out a windows phone for a little while. Having spent so long with Android, however, I was hesitant to spend any significant amount of money. In comes this phone.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if it's the purchase price ($40), or the fact that it's a legitimately good phone, but either way I'm enjoying it so far after a week. A quick rundown:<br/><br/>Size: Smallest phone I've had in a while with a 4.5" screen. Fairly thin, but no ludicrously thin as the trend is going now.<br/><br/>Screen: Decent, but nothing great. I think the resolution is lower than most modern smartphones, but some trick with the glass makes it less noticeable. Touch input seems a little dull, but it might be my hands not being used to the screen size.<br/><br/>Battery: Very surprising considering its small size. I easily get through the day, and could probably push to 2 days.<br/><br/>Build quality: Seems sturdy. You can sometimes get the back removable shell to slightly pop off if squeeze too tight, but it's never been a problem.<br/><br/>Camera: Far from the best, but not the worst I've seen. There is no flash or "selfie" camera, but there is a selfie app if you absolutely have to take a picture of yourself.<br/><br/>Call Quality: The ear speaker is a bit cheap sounding<br/><br/>Speakerphone/External speaker: Similar to the ear speaker<br/><br/>That's about it. I'm enjoying the phone and not having to be super careful with my device ($40 is much less worrisome than $600). Windows Phone app support is a bit of a drag, but I'll survive. Cortana is decent as well.
These are way undersold.  This phone rocks.  There's a lot they don't say, like how the sides of the phone slant inwards from the screen to the back (only slightly) , so that when you're holding it it rests in just a few fingers.  I can hold it comfortably with my fingers and navigate with my thumb (I have a regular sized guys hand fyi)  One of the best parts is the privacy.  Almost every app falls under the Microsoft Privacy and it gives you choices in what information is shared, if any at all.  Unlike Android, where the flashlight app collects data on your phone calls, who you call and where you are (really?  why does a flashlight get that?);  almost all the data collected is anonymous.  True, there are fewer apps;  but I haven't been through all of them and there's plenty to do;  plus more are getting added as it goes.  Plus, you've got all the Xbox Live apps, so there's plenty on that side too.  Something I really dig is that if you're child is under 18 and they sign up for an account, it is automatically a children's version with services.  It's really nice to see a company take pains to protect privacy and children.  That said, the hardware is cool too.<br/>  There are lumia apps too, my favorite so far is mixradio, you can choose a genre and download a playlist and listen offline (good for those of us with free internet at a certain time).  So, now there's always tunes rockin.  The phone does have an fm radio too, it uses your headphones as an antenna.  There's the MSN money app that updates daily news, stocks, etc. and you can have all your portfolios and different news sources all through the same app.  The list goes on, I'm writing a book here.  You can see all of what they have at microsoft.com<br/>  The camera is only 5mp;  but takes better pictures than my older 10mp standalone camera.  There's a lot of software to edit;  I think there's video editing too idk.  The list for Nokia's apps goes on for a while too.<br/>  I think the best parts of the phone is the fact you can set the tiles up however you want.  A few large ones, medium, small;  you can also leave blank spaces.  I made a smiley face out of the news, cloud Cortana and a picture lol.  The other great thing is that the phone isn't huge;  I moved the phone, text, email and internet to the lower right and I can access all the main things one handed with my thumb.<br/>  So, I think it's great;  the privacy thing is huge for me and Microsoft has got it right.  The whole Nokia line seems to have gone unnoticed;  but they've obviously been working at it the whole time.  With an affordable phone that outclasses the flagship phones of most companies, you can't go wrong.  The old adage holds, a great service at an affordable price;  wins.  Is that the moral about not beating your customers over the head?<br/>Thanks Microsoft and Thanks Nokia!
Have been trying out two Lumia 635's to see which service I want to use, AT&T; or T-Mobile. A long story.<br/><br/>Each company sells their own branded Lumia 635 phone. AT&T; and T-Mobile Lumia 635's are both available on Amazon. Note that the phones are not identical. There is an important difference between the AT&T; Lumia and the T-Mobile Lumia, which is why I bought one of each to try.<br/><br/>First, the Lumia 635 in general is excellent. No complaints so far. Amazing quality and performance for the money. Fast, easy to use. Way better than the iPhone I loved in 2009 and used for almost four years.<br/><br/>The Lumia's LTE speed is nice also, better than my old 3G. So far I've gotten around 8 Mb down and 5 Mb up and that is plenty fast for me. Some people seem to have way higher speeds than I do. Depends on your service area I guess.<br/><br/>One thing I did not know until I personally experienced it, is that T-Mobile uses frequencies that do not penetrate buildings as well as the AT&T; frequencies. Lower frequencies work better for that and T-Mobile is upgrading their LTE frequencies in that direction but AT&T; still leads in that area.<br/><br/>Regarding coverage, if you live or travel in rural areas, AT&T; is typically (not always) more complete in coverage than T-Mobile. However that should not be an issue if you do not travel much or if you live and work where signal strength is good.<br/><br/>I have chosen to use MVNO's (mobile virtual netword operators) for my phone plans as they better fit my usage levels and budget. PuretalkUSA for AT&T; and Ting for T-Mobile.<br/><br/>Both plans are very good; a good fit for me at least, except for signal strength.<br/><br/>It is not the Lumia 635 that is the problem, it is the carrier networks and my location.<br/><br/>I started out with a little unlocked Samsung phone using the same PuretalkUSA and Ting gsm SIM cards and the signals on these new Lumias are better (more bars more often). So it's not a phone problem. Phone settings and APNs were checked and double checked.<br/><br/>Now on to why I bought two Lumia 635's and why it may matter to some readers.<br/><br/>It turns out that Lumia 635's are NOT all alike.<br/><br/>If you intend to use T-Mobile, do not buy an AT&T; gophone Lumia 635, unlocked or otherwise. Buy the T-Mobile version. The reason is that there are something like 7 firmwares that can go into the base Lumia 635 phone and AT&T; and T-Mobile each use their own special firmware. Apparently the firmware cannot be re-flashed based on conversations at developer forums. Which is again something rather important. (Probably also why if you stick with a phone that is locked and branded to a particular carrier, the "match" between phone and service is potentially as good as it gets...except that you are locked in of course.)<br/><br/>T-Mobile with its harder-to-penetrate-into-buildings signals has a feature on their Lumia 635 that the AT&T; Lumia 635 does not, Wi-Fi Calling.<br/><br/>AT&T; claims to be adding wi-fi calling, but I'm not sure on which phones. It is definitely not currently on the AT&T; version Lumia 635 at this time and may well never be for all I know. In general wi-fi calling is probably not as important to AT&T; as it is to T-Mobile because AT&T; works better in buildings than T-Mobile already. Then again, having that feature would be an improvement nonetheless.<br/><br/>The T-Mobile version of the phone has wi-fi calling built in, you just need to turn it on and be on the T-Mobile network for it to work. (Again, on the AT&T; version Lumia, there is no such option even shown in the software settings.)<br/><br/>Anyway, your T-Mobile calls hook into wi-fi networks you are able to access and connect you that way instead of needing to use the phones' radio to connect to a cell tower. If you have a good wi-fi signal, you will have strong connections and high call quality using wi-fi calling. Most of the time you will still be charged for the minutes used with some exceptions, so it is not like using Skype or Viber.<br/><br/>In my case, I first purchased an AT&T; go phone Lumia 635. I had AT&T; unlock the phone as described in some of the reviews here and that worked well.<br/><br/>I put in a Ting SIM card which uses the T-Mobile network and while it worked, the T-Mobile signal was kind of weak where I most often use the phone; almost to the point where the service was useless. I next tried a PuretalkUSA SIM, which uses the AT&T; network, and that worked great for me.<br/><br/>Then, we experienced a storm and power outage. I thought I'd fire up the Lumia 635's internet sharing feature (hotspot) to check something out on a remote computer with my laptop and I found I could not connect.<br/><br/>I later learned PuretalkUSA does not allow tethering or hotspots. Ting however does. Trouble is, where I live and work, Ting only works for me if I use Wi-Fi calling, and then it works better than AT&T;! But if there is no wi-fi, Ting doesn't work consistently enough to bother with. How to decide? 99% of the time I have wi-fi, so what's the big deal?<br/><br/>Driving around with both phones, checking the signals; the signal strength is pretty much similar. It's just in my home and business and a few other locations where the T-Mobile signal isn't strong enough to effectively use unless wi-fi is available.<br/><br/>I hope my situation makes some sense if it applies to you. Frankly it is still confusing to me. I think I can sum it up as AT&T; PuretalkUSA gives me a more consistent signal "everywhere" but no hotspot; T-Mobile Ting gives me a hotspot, but not where I live and work! On the other hand T-Mobile Ting gives better call quality 99% of the time than AT&T; PuretalkUSA so long as I can use wi-fi. On the other hand again, using Skype on wi-fi also gives good call quality where I live and work and then it doesn't matter which brand of Lumia 635 phone I use or which network--but of course that all fails if there is no wi-fi.<br/><br/>What I will probably do is stick with my unlocked AT&T; Lumia 635 using PuretalkUSA and keep the T-Mobile Lumia 635 as a backup phone and hotspot. I do not need a hotspot very often, but I want to have one. $6/mo to park it at Ting is not bad for that. If I walk a few hundred yards I can get a better hotspot signal and at least I'll have something if the power or my cable internet connection goes out.<br/><br/>People have written many helpful Amazon reviews which have guided me and I wanted to add what I have learned about AT&T; / T-Mobile Lumia differences and why that might matter to some folks.<br/><br/>Also, I did not unlock the T-Mobile Lumia 635 and Ting worked just fine out of the box. Others say the same about the AT&T; gophone should they want to use PuretalkUSA with it.<br/><br/>The Lumia 635 is an amazing phone--other reviewers have pointed that out again and again--and I concur. I am very happy with the price and the performance of the phone, unfortunately getting it to work with a service plan can be tricky depending on where you live, work, drive, and what your needs are. One or the other Lumia 635's will probably work well for you as they have for me. Just buy the correct phone! Or get both if you need too.
I got the Nokia Lumia 635 last December to replace my Lumia 520.  Unfortunatly I'm realatively clumsy and tend to drop my phones a lot.  On Superbowl Sunday I dropped my phone and it landed flat on the floor, somehow shattering the glass.  It was so disappointing, but because the phone was so cheap to begin with I went out and got another one and have been using it ever since.<br/><br/>Overall I do really like the phone.  It has a sleek, modern size, has a great battery life, looks nice and has great functionality.  That being said there are a lot of cons to it too, but many of my issues with it are things to be expected with a budget smartphone.<br/><br/>First of all, I have it in a hard case but still the cheap plastic shell is bent and chipped in a few places from being dropped and every time it gets dropped all the pieces come apart including the battery.  Not the end of the world, just irritating.  There are also not a lot of case options for this phone, making it harder to protect from damage.  Second there is no front facing camera, so, while the selfie app is really helpful (it beeps when you're in the frame so you know when the photo is taking), it's hard to get a good picture (that, and the camera is only 5mp so not great to begin with).  My final qualm is not so much for the phone itself but for windows phones in general.  While I actually like the layout and functionality of windows phones, the apps available are not extensive.  I'm an on-call EMT/Firefighter and we get our calls through a specific app that isn't available on windows phones so I recently ended up switching to an iPhone just to be able to do my job, but like I said, thats a windows phone issue not a Lumia 635 issue specifically.<br/><br/>Overall, if you're looking for a good budget phone and don't plan on taking a lot of pictures and are OK with the apps available for windows phones then I would definitely recommend this phone.  It works well for what it is, just not for what I needed.
If what you desire is top of the line, full featured, amazing screen with amazing feature smart phone, then this isn't the device for you.<br/><br/>If what you want is a capable phone, that offers easy setup, easy use, crystal clear phone calls, and don't mind that it can't use all of the apps you get on an iPhone (namely SnapChat, though there are functional differences for even some of the cross platform apps like Instragram), then the Lumia 635 could be the right choice for you.<br/><br/>It's inexpensive. Notice I said inexpensive, not cheap. There is a difference. In this case, inexpensive means no hardware based back/Start/search buttons, no dedicated camera button, and a lower resolution screen than a higher end device. It's also made of plastic, and skimps on internal storage space. There is also no front facing camera for video calling via Skype.<br/><br/>All of these things, except maybe the screen and front facing camera, are fairly easily overcome.<br/><br/>For storage, you can install a microSD card, up to 128 GB, into the phone. Given the price of a 32 MB card is roughly $12 (give or take) as of this writing, "fixing" that issue isn't overly expensive.<br/><br/>For the dedicated camera button, train yourself to swipe down from the top of the screen and press the "camera" button from there.<br/><br/>For the hardware based back/Start/search bttons, unfortunately you just have to get used to the always present software based buttons. They work the same way as the hardware based buttons.<br/><br/>The screen resolution, to me, is acceptable but nothing amazing. Compared to the Lumia 1020 that I also own, it's not as crisp or clear. The 1080 has a 1280 x 768 vs the 635 having 854 x 480. The 1020 is also OLED vs IPS LED. For the price of this phone, however, the screen is definitely acceptable.<br/><br/>The screen is also made from Gorilla Glass, so it should be able to withstand a beating.<br/><br/>The back is plastic and can be swapped with other color backs. I'm good with the black.<br/><br/>Features I really appreciate are the user replaceable battery (no more planned obsolescence), user replaceable memory card, and the very responsive touch screen.<br/><br/>What I don't like is the lack of a front facing camera (Skype calls work, but no video of you easily)  and the lower resolution screen.<br/><br/>Overall, for the price, especially the sales prices I've seen ($30 for a smartphone!?), this is a solid performer with only the lack of front facing camera maybe keeping it back.<br/><br/>Highly recommended if you don't need the front facing camera.
I felt the need to review this item, as I was very WORRIED about upgrading to this phone based on its specs compared to the lumia 520.<br/>They're very similar, and upon first inspection online, you may find that you'll be losing a few things. Namely, the camera button.<br/><br/>However, having received this phone, and paying roughly what I'd pay for the 520 ($45), I'm very pleased.<br/><br/>The phone has a very solid feel in your hands, though it's a bit difficult to get the back cover off, compared to the last model.<br/><br/>Performance wise? I'm amazed.<br/>The phone has had a noticeable processor upgrade, as well as graphics, as you'll notice much higher framerates and response times on this phone compared to a 520 that you've had for a while.<br/><br/>With the upgraded amount of RAM, I am actually able to successfully multitask.<br/>Before, on the 520, whenever I'd run the GPS (Beautiful GPS app regardless), and try to listen to spotify in the background, my phone would struggle to keep up with either.<br/>Also, with GPS open, if listening to the radio, the resources being used by the GPS make it nearly impossible to bring up Cortana to do anything before it times out / crashes up.<br/><br/>On the 635, however, I'm able to handle multiple apps running at the same time. Cortana opens very quickly, even while I'm running other apps.<br/><br/>The phone is able to process much more data over wifi and 4G, and actually has a better signal at my house, where my last phone frequently dropped calls. Over a wireless G/N network, it was able to download at 10-15Mbps and upload at a steady 9.<br/>Over the '4G', with 1 bar, it was able to download at 4Mbps and upload at 3-4, with a moderately low ping of ~130ms.<br/>For reference, my 520 would freeze up during the speed test, and would not be able to get more than 4-5mbps upload or download on wifi, and had trouble getting more than 2.5mbps on the wireless network. I think this was more of a performance issue than a connectivity one. Windows Phone 8.1 dev didn't take to the 520 nicely; but you get my point :)<br/><br/>For a phone which I used just for business, I'm very pleased.
Thankfully, at the time of writing, AT&T; will unlock these phones for free through their unlock portal website as long as you choose the option that states that you are "not an AT&T; customer".  That means that you can use this with any other US carrier that is on the GSM network using SIM cards (T-mobile, etc.)<br/><br/>These were on sale for $30 directly from Amazon.  $30 is amazing for something that seems as fast as an iPhone 5, has the latest updates, is light and fairly thin, has a battery lasts all day, allows use of a microSD card, and can be unlocked for free and be used on any carrier.<br/><br/>One major issue is the one that everyone knows about: There just simply aren't a lot of apps for the Windows phone.  You have to research if all of your favorite apps are available on a Windows phone before jumping into it.<br/><br/>The other major issue is that certain apps such as Viber and Skype will not allow you to end a call (hang up, hang-up, hangup).  Whenever you try to end a call, the phone either registers your finger as your face and deactivates the screen (screen goes black) or it is becoming confused with extra oils left on the screen and turns the screen off each time you try to push the "end" button.  It's a safety feature that works great on other phones and models, but with the Lumia 635, something is registering incorrectly and it tries to protect you from an accidental hang-up even though you're deliberately trying to hang up.  The actual phone dialer in Windows doesn't have this issue, so it seems that the issue is limited to third-party applications that are not directly customized to work on the 635 model (since, for example, Skype for Windows Phones 8.1 is made to work with all Windows phones, not just for this phone and its quirky sensor/timing).  You'll have to come up with creative work-around such as waiting for the other person to end the call, actually asking the other person to end the call, or force-closing the app.
This is my first smart phone. And because it is smart it is easy to set up and operate. I've only had it for a few days and already I love it. So glad I purchased it. Can do a lot without a service contract, of course you can do even more with one.
Great Phone, I have been using the 630 and MotoG LTE with cricket but liked the Windows phone better but also wanted the LTE speeds.<br/>Since Cricket is ATT now I thought I would try the GoPhone with my Cricket sim.  Works perfect out of the box.
I've only had the lumia 635 for about 2 weeks now, but I love it. It replaces a Lumia 520 it is a little bigger<br/>and there are a few more features than the 520. I will do another update in a month or so and let everyone<br/>know what I think.
The only thing I don't like is that the priced dropped down shortly after I bought it.<br/><br/>It has been over seven years since I owned a phone and so I am still a bit unsure of myself in learning how to use it, but it is ME making it hard to figure out what to do.  My son, who has one, just shook his head, put in the contacts for me and then walked away.  :)<br/>I printed out the manual and am reading it to learn what it can do and how to do it.  I'm not one for taking pictures of myself, don't see why anyone want to take a photo of themselves and send it to others.  Skype  eh, not a big deal, chatting on the phone is good enough.<br/>This generation of tech kids may need to see themselves doing things, but I grew up where we had party lines on our phones; so this is more than enough for me.<br/>I have yet to download apps, want to have music stored on it, not sure how many hours it will hold, that to me is what counts, not how many "songs"; what I listen to will go from two minutes to 20 minutes, so  how much time (hours) it will hold is what I would like to know.  Wi-Fi is going to be great to use, no need for a data plan.  Windows store has more than enough apps and games to satisfy me so no need for Google or other places.<br/><br/>Calls are easy, especially with my being able to tell Cortana to call hubby for me so I can ask him to pick up a loaf of bread on his way home from work.<br/>A phone that isn't so small that I can drop it, nice size screen for my vision; getting old and it is harder to see things  :) .  Keyboard that I can type on, or tell it to call someone for me.  seems sturdy enough, nice sound to it, glad that I bought it and recommend it for anyone who wants a nice phone that has a lot to offer, a good price and without all kind of bells and whistles that will never be used.<br/><br/>.<br/>The more I learn about it the more I like it, it is able to do what is needed and a bit more.  Good quality, good price and a very nice phone that I am glad that I bought.  Just wished I had waited a few days longer and save 20 bucks.
I have needed to upgrade to a new phone for a couple years now and the cost of this phone was not expensive. The features are nice too and I am still learning how to use some of its features. I do like Cortona and she is a pretty smart lady.
Bought it for the 5MP camera and using it as a pay as you go phone.<br/>Pictures looks great you need a micro usb cable to transfer to pc for full picture.<br/>Also need an App on your PC for windows 7 & 8.<br/>Everything working fine.
This might be a cheap phone but I got to say that I've been very impressed with it. The email, web browsing, and general user experience has been fairly nice. I actually prefer the windows phone OS over Android. Great phone for the price.
Overall this a good choice for a budget phone if you're willing to overlook some flaws and inconveniences. It offers a good display with a decent processor that loads apps fairly quickly. Call service, quality, and texting all worked as expected with no real complaints outside of the somewhat odd Windows interface that takes some getting used to. The outer casing may feel a little cheap, but I've had no problems with phone durability even after a few drops.<br/><br/>On the negative side I did encounter a big problem with some apps simply refusing to ever install on my phone. Even some apps that came pre-installed on the phone refused to update and run correctly. I wasn't able to fix this issue or pinpoint the cause even after some internet research, but I admittedly was never bothered by it enough to dedicate a lot of time to trying to fix it. Other apps would download and work perfectly fine.<br/><br/>Internet Explorer also has a tendency to crash regularly and just not work well on some popular websites I like to visit, sometimes requiring me to soft reset the phone in order to clear up whatever problems it was having.<br/><br/>The camera is fine for well lit outdoor environments, but don't expect to take any decent pictures or video in most indoor settings. Also, no front facing camera wasn't a big deal to me personally, but I know a lot of people would find that a big negative.<br/><br/>I've used this phone for about 6 months, and for the price the Lumia 635 deliverers about what you can expect feature wise, but possibly with the cost of putting up with some technical problems.
Nice device and great value given the price.  Does not have allot of available apps compared to I-phone.  Camera is just ok and fine for someone like me.  If your looking for the latest and greatest apps, choose a different phone
This phone replaces the Nokia Lumia 520 I had, where the screen cracked after a drop onto the sidewalk. The first thing I noticed was how much larger the 635 is - the display area is around a centimeter taller and the case is much larger and heavier. Everything has a more "premium" feel, with sharper, higher contrast graphics and faster boot and loading times.<br/><br/>I'm getting used to the 3 "tool" buttons being removed from below the display (the back, Windows and search buttons are now part of the Windows interface) and the removal of the camera button (now you have to open the camera interface and use the screen to take a picture). I also noticed a lot more unnecessary programs loaded up from the start, so it took time to pare them back down to the essentials.<br/><br/>I was already a Go Phone user and the 635 picked up my account information from my existing SIM card without any problems (you can also use the included new one but you have to call and update your account and number to the new card).<br/><br/>One picky item is that the back piece is no longer a thick rubber but more of a slightly bendable plastic. It's harder to remove in case you want to change the battery or SIM card, and doesn't provide the nice grip you could get with the 520.<br/><br/>Also keep in mind that (like the 520) the phone doesn't come with a USB cable, so you will have to buy one yourself if you want to transfer files between the phone and a computer.
Love this phone.  Had to get a new sim card to fit it at AT&T;, but no charge.  (I did not have a smart phone before, so my sim card was too big.)  Easy to use, clear reception, long battery life and everything I need plus more!
I absolutely love this phone.  It is so cool and has so many features that are helpful to me.  I just can't say enough good comments about it.  if you don't love your Iphone, try this Windows Phone.  You will be very pleased.
Excellent sound quality and reception. Easy to navigate and use. My only complaint is that the start button is very close to the space bar when using the keypad and I accidentally hit it occasionally when trying to hit space.
Fiasco phone never worked couldn't activate the piece where the SIM card or goes is defective and the battery itS an old one it shows scratches everywhere. Waste of money and disappointment because it was a gift to my father
it took me awhile to learn how to use it but now,its a great windows phone I love it, works great,and the price was outstanding,what a great value for the money  ,I should have ordeed two the the greatprice on cyber monday
great, great smartphone for the money. i recently dropped mine in a body of water, so i bought another one on amazon made a phone call to att and i was back in business in no time. no contract, no hassle, very economical.
Well made phone. Perfect size screen and the quality is very good for the price.<br/>Needs some improvement in application market.<br/>Camera is usable and GPS is working fine but sometimes there's loss of signal.
<br/><br/>
I woefully drowned my Oneplus One phone at a church camp. Or, I guess you could say it got baptized and shortly thereafter went to be with Jesus. The flagship killer apparently isn't waterproof, but alas what phone is, right? I was out of town, in the middle of nowhere, and without a phone. Not a big deal, except the dean of our camp was sending text updates to the counselors for the day's activities. I ran the Oneplus One on straight talk with AT&T; towers. The walmart wireless "expert" informed me that this phone would be the only phone to fit my sim size, and that it would definitely work with my straight talk sim card. I'm not sure, but maybe the fact that my sim card ran on AT&T; towers made the difference? All I had to do was manually update a few APN settings, easy enough thanks to my pal google. I paid about ten bucks less than what was on amazon due to a killer sale in the middle of podunk, mid-west. I have to say, I'm quite impressed. I miss the old OPO, but I'm liking the size of this phone, and the 8.1 operating system isn't too shabby. So in summation: straight talk sim cards apparently work on the gophone as well, and this phone is such a great bang for your buck, especially as a back up phone. It has good social media apps, which is all I basically use on my phone anyway. If I want computer functions, I'll use my computer. I'll use it when traveling to rugged places, camping, and definitely at church camp next year. A great starter phone for ages 12-15.
Great phone for a new "smart phone" user.  Didn't want to invest a lot while learning how to use it.  This phone does everything I need plus...  Just the right size screen and easy to follow instructions.
I love this phone. Great phone for the price ($40-$50) with no contract. One of the best deals for thanks giving 2014.<br/>Please dont compare to Android or iOS when you are buying a phone for very less price.
I bought this for my husband when his wifi stopped working on his iPhone. So far he loves it! He's constantly watching videos on it, gets great reception everywhere, and recommends it to everyone he talks to.
This is the third time I am placing mobile order on amazon reason because they always have the best deal out of all.I like this mobile because this is simple and easy to use.Also this is low cost maintaince.
I'm posting my review from this phone. Everything I could have wanted for a bargain. Coming from a razr this is light years ahead, and only the most discerning smartphone fashionistas will have a complaint.
I bought this phone because I wanted tot try out a windows phone.  I am already at AT&T; customer so I just swapped my sim out from my Android phone.<br/><br/>For the price, I don't see how you can go wrong.  The main negative to this phone is that the screen does not have one of those anti grease coatings.  As a result, its gets smudgy really fast.  The screen is low resolution by today's standards but I find text easy to read on it.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the phone is pretty snappy--you can move through screens fairly quickly.  Some apps take a while to load, but it isn't too annoying.  The onscreen keyboard is one of the best that I've used to date.  Battery life is good--i can easily get a full day and sometimes more.<br/><br/>If I could change anything, it would be to add a camera flash.  I don't really care that the camera doesn't have a flash but I would like one for the flashlight capabilities.<br/><br/>Regarding the Windows phone OS, I've always thought it looks great.  After using the phone for a few days, my opinion has not changed.  It looks great and works great.  The Cortana personal digital assistant works really well for being a beta or 1.0 version.  The main drawback for me is that I am a heavy user of Google Hangouts for text chat and there isn't any way to use this service on Windows Phone.  Other than that, I've found all the apps I use on a regular basis are available on Windows phone.
Having been an Android smartphone user for a number of years, I recently purchased this Windows 8 phone, and I highly recommend it!  With a few minor exceptions, I find this phone easier to use, with vastly longer battery life and more intuitive features, than my old Android device.  I might add that my Android device also cost significantly more, had to be recharged constantly, and was not nearly so fun to use.<br/><br/>For the price, the Nokia Lumia 635 is a great bargain, and though its feature set is admittedly less extensive than more expensive phones, it is more than adequate to meet the needs of most users - and it comes with 4G LTE!  The Windows 8 operating system works spectacularly well and looks gorgeous, and the automatic syncing with my Windows 8 computer is a nice bonus.  No, this phone doesn't have a forward-facing camera for selfies (though it does have software to assist with taking selfies from the rear-facing camera).  The camera also has no flash, but takes very nice photos nonetheless.  By far the most severe limitation to Windows 8 phones is the lack of quality apps, and that is unfortunate, though not a deal-breaker for me.  This phone does have limited RAM, but so far that hasn't caused any issues for me.<br/><br/>If you are looking for an inexpensive phone that looks gorgeous, runs on an exceptional mobile operating system, with a battery that lasts for days, I strongly suggest you consider this phone!
This is a great phone.  The Window's software works very smooth.  The battery lasts over a day with heavy use.  The only drawback is there is no flash for the camera but for 49 dollars I can't complain.
Band new, came quick, and has more features than I thought. I still struggle to understand why folks pay so much money for apple phones when $50 will give you access to all the same apps and functions
God. Ive got iphone6 but now i wanna change to lumia 635 its really beautiful. Sort of functions doesnt work though. I actually dont need that. Thanks lumia 635 nice to meet you. -written on iphone 6-
Great product for beginners.
great phone at a great price
Great phone, great price. This is my first smartphone so I really can't compare it to any other.<br/>I do like all the features. The speakers could use some improvement. Otherwise, no complaints.
Front camera would have made this phone 5+ stars. Pound for pound or Dollar for Dollar - this is the best cellphone out there.<br/>Unlocked from ATT for free and using it on T-Mobile LTE 45/25.
Takes a little getting use to, but for the price you can't go wrong.  It didn't include  much of a users guide, but I've been able to find information  on the computer to help guide me through.
Amazing phone for the price
I highly suggest Nokia Windows phones.  This one, the Lumia 635 was my first.  It was used in place of my Blackberry 9780.  I was a Blackberry user for years and decided to switch.  It takes some time to get used to the keypad versus qwerty keyboard.  Here are the reasons why I suggest this phone.<br/>-  Windows is a solid OS which I prefer over Android and Apple iOS.<br/>-  Pretty good battery life<br/>-  It syncs with my Microsoft Dell computer for various functions.<br/>-  I use Companion Link to sync contacts via Outlook.<br/>-  Cortana is very useful and helpful<br/>-  only cost me around $50<br/>-  has a lot of good applications for download for business, weather, voice recording, sports, etc.  I don't play games, so I don't know if the Microsoft store is good for games.<br/>-  Camera is adequate and so is the video but not great.<br/>-  Very good voice recognition when making voice text messages.<br/>-  The OS organization with the tiles is great, in my opinion.<br/>-  I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 only because it takes a lot for me to give a 5, doesn't have a flash for the camera.<br/>-  The size of the phone is perfect.  It's on the smaller side in comparison to the new iPhone and Samsung phones but that works for me.  If you want a bigger phone with a flash and front camera, then go for the Lumia 640.
Product is great. It takes a little bit of learning curve. However, there are many tutorials out there to read and to watch. I will buy this item again and will work with this seller again.
fast, does everything a smartphone should do, cheap. Set up was a total b, but otherwise I can't complain. love the digital vm box, as I hate having to go in through audio to clear them.
I bought this as a "burner" phone to use waiting for my new iphone to arrive.  I am OS agnostic (I own and use devices running Windows 7 and 10, OS-X, iOS, chrome OS and linux) but I had never tried a windows phone before. I wasn't expecting much, but I am quite impressed.  The 653 is no iPhone 6s Plus--but you wouldn't expect it to be.  Though it lacks the polish and power of Cupertino's finest, it's kind of amazing how serviceable this device is.  I was most impressed with its ability to pull in a cell signal.  LTE is a plus in this price range, and data service works well too.  The sad part of the experience is the apps--or lack thereof.  No Google apps at all.  Facebook native app is OK but has some dumb features--you're probably better off using the mobile browser version instead.  Waze--it exists, but it's buggy.  1Password--alpha version only.  etc. etc.  Also, the camera is just bad.  But...this phone is like $40.  So I can't really complain.  What's more, the native Here GPS app allows me to download maps to the device.  So now I've got a GPS for the motorcycle!<br/><br/>My iphone showed up today and I'm glad for that.  All the same, I'll kind of miss this scrappy little device.  It would be perfect for a first smartphone, or for a youngster, or for a backup/burner.
I bought this phone as a backup for my 1520 and to test Windows 10. I was really surprised at how fast it moves with Windows 10 Preview, especially when compared to the old Lumia 520
I like the phone, but I am having trouble with the phone not receiving all text. There are a couple of people (3) that have iPhones and when they text  me I don't receive their text.
Great phone. Price is cheap! Processor is fast! Using the internet share feature easily eliminates my home internet provider need.  Microsoft and Nokia got this low end phone right.
Couldn't be more happy; I wish I had known earlier, I would have bought 2 at this price. I bought my wife one earlier from Best Buy for $20 more. We're happy with the phones though!
Great value windows smart phone with LTE. Choppy on google maps given only 512mb ram, and no front facing camera, but otherwise perfect for my needs.  Windows 10 beta compatible.
Awesome! Love this phone.
Got this phone when it went on sale for $29.99. I bought two and gave one to a friend for his younger daughter. I was an iphone 5 user but was having trouble with it so i bought this as a backup for when it crashed. I was impressed with the size of the screen as it is slightly bigger then my iphone 5. It took a while to get used to the button placements, but overall i found the phone to be very quick considering it only at 512mb ram built into it. Windows phone user interface is ok. I find that unlike ios you are constantly having to press the back button within apps or when you reopen an app after say receiving a text, the app will sometimes reload from the beginning instead of where i left off. There may be options to turn on backgrounding for these apps but then they will probably drain the battery. Speaking of battery, it has been great, i have never gone a day in two weeks where i had to charge my phone before going to bed. Overall, for the price this is not only an amazing back up phone in case of emergency but this is a pretty good everyday use phone, the only thing holding it back is better apps for the windows app store, as i tried to get as many of my apps as i could from the iphone and could only find 1 or 2 compatible on windows phone.
I love this phone,I simply can't put it down,It does soooo many things.I discover new things daily.I'm a senior (77) and the help messages are great.You will love it too<br/>m
Great AT&T; replacement phone. Good signal, two days battery life, Windows tiles easy to use and to see your info. I might have to stay with Nokia and Windows phone for awhile.
Would work great for someone who knows about these things. Unfortunately, I have been left in the dust, so to speak... LOL!<br/>No "smart phone addiction" here. ;)
For a first time smartphone user this phone is loaded with features is reliable very good value and is east to use, plus the camera is very good for the price of the phone.
This is actually my first real smartphone and I admit to some prejudice about the whole idea- it's wayyyyy more powerful than I need and the 1x10^^6 features get in the way often. I make a lot of annoying finger-fumble errors swiping, typing, and dialing. The basic functionality of the phone is good, pretty much the same as any other smartphone, if you want to deal with Windows mobile OS. If you're not used to it, it will be as big a PITA as any other new OS, critiques of Windows aside. I got a castoff, previously-connected AT&T; phone from my kid and ordered a SIM card from Consumer's cell and after the normal amount of frummoxing it works 100%. There really should be a better way to export/import contacts from old phones though- I tried for days and finally ended up physically cutting my old full-size SIM card down to micro-SIM size (using  template from some website) and plugging it in to move the contacts. Just another bump in the road. Music player works quite fine; the screen is big and bright and works well. I think under-40$ is the right price for one of these things; if you don't need the latest greatest apps and don't base your entire life walking around beeping on a phone 24/7, go for it.
This does the job, is small enough to easily manipulate with one hand, the software is easy to use, and many of the on-device apps offer useful features w/o downloading others from the Store.<br/><br/>Some downsides<br/>Setup was bizarrely difficult. There was a sticker placed over an important part of the setup instructions on the box--and the replacement phone I got (yes, I couldn't get the first one to work) was in the same place. Nowhere in the documentation that came with the phone *or* on the ATT website told me how to do one very important step--how to enter the activation code. Where? How? With what app or tool? The ATT website says explicitly they don't have support for Go phones outside of the website, so you can't call/chat. Googling didn't help. Amazon Customer Service didn't know.<br/><br/>Eventually I just tried entering the code into either the phone dialer or the SMS text messaging app (I don't remember which because I was so frustrated I must have blocked out which one).<br/><br/>That worked, the phone got set up, and from that point on it has worked just fine.<br/><br/>For that, I dinged this down to a 4.
Fantastic phone! Affordable, efficient, and easy to use. Unfortunately, the sim card insert was broken and had to return it. However, I would purchase it again.
Excellent windows starter phone.<br/>Pros: Cheap, unlocked, 4G, 4.5" phone. Bright screen. Excellent call quality.<br/>Cons: app store, camera, only 8GB.
I used a Nokia 520 for a year or so, and liked it a lot. After misplacing it, I got this one, and like it even better. It's faster than the 520, which was acceptable but a bit laggy at times. The 635 is as snappy as much more expensive phones.<br/><br/>The 635 has a slightly larger screen, but still fits comfortably in my pocket. This is one of the big advantages of this phone and others like it - I really don't want a phone much larger than this.<br/><br/>And, of course, the price is hard to beat. Even though it's a GoPhone, you can just take it to an ATT store and have the SIM card attached to your existing ATT account. (I should mention that the ATT stores are significantly improved from their abysmal customer service of a few years ago.)<br/><br/>Battery life is fine. I get about three to four days of normal usage off a charge, even with wifi on.<br/><br/>If you've never had Windows Phone 8.1, you might want to give it a try. There are some missing apps, of course, but most of the major ones are there, and the interface is easy to use. Features such as tethering are built-in and a piece of cake to use.
Awesome phone. I have used Android and other WP phones before, and hands down, this one is on par/better than all the ones I had. And the price is amazing!
Excellent phone. I got it for the price of $39. How can you beat that?? WP8.1 is smooth as butter. It's a lovely OS. Even at $69.00 it's worth every penny.
Bought this phone to replace a Motorola RAZR V3. I use it as a basic phone and occasionally I use the email and WiFi features. Great phone for the price.
Really good phone and easy to use.... I liked it very much.. Not many apps available compare to Android and iOS, else phone performance is really good...
Windows 10 Preview Phone here !!!<br/>Came locked to AT&T;, placed an order to unlock online and got the code 10 mins later.<br/>Perfect budget phone !
I like this phone very much but Microsoft tells me there should have been a 114 page manual with<br/>the package I received but I did not get a MANUAL?
replaced a active phone that my daughter took swimming... Just replaced sim, updated, and logged into account. Replaced a Cricket phone and works well.
Quick delivery. I purchased this Nokia to replace a older phone. After transferring phones at ATT I like it. Decent phone at very reasonable<br/>cost
I ordered this phone a few weeks ago. It arrived with a broken SIM reader, but I returned it and received a new one. It works amazingly and I love it.
<br/><br/>
I was surprisingly pleased at how well this phone works given it's price. The Windows OS is really smooth and snappy. It feels a lot faster than my Google Nexus 4. I was downloading in the background had a couple apps going and noticed no lag or slowdown. The UI is very crisp and smooth. I didn't really spend time looking into what apps are available in the MS store. I am guessing it's not as populated as the Google and IOS stores, but it don't too a ton of stuff on my phone, so it doesn't matter as much to me.<br/><br/>The offline maps are awesome. You can download maps for specific countries and regions and you don't need to be online for navigation. The phone locked onto GPS almost immediately (definitely faster than my Nexus 4).<br/><br/>Also, I found that on T-Mobile, this phone is a lot faster in uploading and downloading than the Nexus 4. I suspect this is because the Nexus 4 does not support all of the T-Mobile LTE channels wheras the Nokia does.<br/><br/>Overall, you could not get a better phone for the price. Highly recommended!
I purchased this phone during Best Buy’s four hour sale for $19.95 as a backup phone. In fact, because the price was so low, I purchased three of them so everyone with a phone in my family could have a backup. I once watched my son’s (not yet paid off) Samsung S4 fly off a rollercoaster.<br/><br/>I’m on T-Mobile and this is an AT&T; GoPhone. I was able to go on AT&T;’s web site and unlock all them for free! (more on the unlocking later)<br/><br/>As a backup phone, I’m impressed. I’ve been using it as my daily driver for a week and it does everything I need it to do. I’ve read a few reviews that say this is a great backup phone, great first smartphone, and great phone for your kids. All true depending on how you use your phone. For me it does everything I need it to do but I’m not a Snapchater or and Instramer.<br/><br/>My normal daily driver has been an LG G2 and an OnePlus One. Both Android based phones.<br/><br/>Let’s start with the bad…<br/>The camera…Only 5 megapixel with no flash. Pictures are ok in good lighting b... Read more
When my Note 2 finally gave out(one drop too many!) I went to my local Walmart to buy a cheap replacement phone to get me through until my upgrade. This seemed the best of the bunch. There are some aspects I that weren't bad-the tiles thing is kind of neat and looks nice, and hey, I could text and receive phone calls again! But that was about it. Calls themselves weren't the best, but doable. App store is lacking for sure, but I knew that going in(although it was still annoying)  But my biggest gripe is that the phone just can't handle processes well. Want to check in on Facebook? Sure! But you can only scroll down your time line for about 30 seconds before it shuts off. And then it says "resuming..." but doesn't take you back to where you left off. Same goes for Internet, even simple web sites. It is really annoying to be in the middle of an article and then lose it. I guess if you are just using it for the basics, it's ok. Otherwise, absolutely a no for this phone. I was SO happy and grateful when my upgrade finally came around!
I've been lightly using AT&T;'s pre-pay $100 a year GoPhone service for a few years with a folding Samsung phone, so when I read the largely positive reviews for the Windows Phone OS and saw the give-away price for the Lumia 635, I gave it a shot. The sim card from my old phone wouldn't fit but it was easy and free to transfer my GoPhone account at the AT&T; store. This is my first smartphone and I'm amazed by the quality of the gizmo. Just as a telephone, it's better than my old one plus it's a decent pocket computer; mp3 player, FM radio, GPS, and camera. I have streamed a few Netflix videos through my home Wi-Fi with no hick-ups. The screen is crisp and the audio with ear-buds is just fine. It linked up with my Microsoft and Facebook accounts and populated the phone's address book without any struggle. I can't believe that others are complaining that it only takes pictures in 1 direction. The only real downside is that it's hard to read the screen in full sunlight and it is a piece of glass more easily broken than my old flip-phone.
I bought this phone because my previous phone would stop receiving text messages from time to time. I looked on Amazon for a GoPhone and this is the first that came up. Looked at the reviews and they said that it does what it is intended to do (text, call, internet). I came from an Android phone so I am used to pretty much going on the app store and getting anything I wanted because the app store is huge. On the Android phone, I would pretty much call, text, play minor games, Snapchat, twitter and Instagram and check email. This phone has the ability to everything that I want it to but somethings are limited.<br/><br/>Snapchat is a third-party software that in my opinion, sucks compared to the actual but it gets the job done.<br/><br/>Twitter and Instagram are great.<br/><br/>Email kinda sucks as well. I mostly use Gmail and there are apps on the app store but they are third party and I am not comfortable giving my email and password to someone that isn't Google or "name brand." The Windows email is not th... Read more
I love this phone. It comes with the At&t; micro sim card needed to activate the phone however, if you have a different micro sim card, (from At&t;), it will accept it. You can add additional memory by purchasing another micro sim MEMORY card. This phone uses Windows 8 programming, and apps are already uploaded to the phone as soon as it's turned on. You can go to the app store to add or purchase as many apps that you want provided you have enough memory to do so. The activation was very simple and there are about 3 different ways to activate this phone service. The battery life on the phone is pretty decent, it looks like it could work without charging for 2-3 days depending upon how much you use it. This smartphone is cheaper to order here than anywhere else that I've seen and even less if you are able to get this item on Amazon Daily Deals. It was shipped fast and brand new. There is no physical keyboard, you must use the touch screen keyboard to text or type in a web address. Overall, I'm happy that I order this phone from Amazon.
I bought this as a spare phone, mostly out of curiosity to see what kind of 4G phone I could get for $50. I have been pleasantly surprised. I switch back and forth with my Nexus 5, but I probably use this phone 90% of the time. I like that it is a little smaller and fits in my pocket. While the screen is not as high resolution as the Nexus 5, it is certainly acceptable. I also really like the Windows operating system on it. I never thought I would use anything other than Android, but I really like Windows on a phone. I should also state that I do not download many apps, so that may make me more accepting of Windows. The only thing I would says Nokia should have spent a few more dollars on is the camera. There is no flash, and the camera, while taking pretty good pictures, could be a lot better. I don't take selfies, so I don't care that it only has one camera, but others may differ. I've sold two other people on this phone based on price. I think it is a bargain. My next phone will probably be a higher end Windows phone.
Paying hundreds of dollars for a phone to just be locked into a contract is blah. You hear that Amazon!? I guess so as the Fire Phone has decreased from $200 to 99 cents, but still with a contract! Anyway, for a hundred bucks this phone does everything I want it to do.<br/><br/>I'm coming from the Lumia 520, which really set the bar for affordable smart phones. The great thing with this phone is that Windows 8.1 and Cortana are already installed on the device. Saves a bit of time, but the screen gets bumped up to 4.5 inches, adds a few more pixels, gets a hardware boost from a dual core to a Quad core, 1200 MHz, ARM Cortex-A7, and comes with a larger battery giving you about 4 more hours of talk time.<br/><br/>Being fairly new to the whole smart phone thing I was literally blown away by the personal assistant Cortana. The voice recognition is spot on, even with my heavy Jersey accent. Being able to tell her anything, from calling someone, to setting appointments, all the way to having her send text... Read more
I came home this afternoon to that familiar brown box with the smiley on it, tore into it, and have been playing with my new phone ever since. I bought the 635 as a replacement until I'm eligible to upgrade again.<br/><br/>If you intend to use it is a GoPhone, or this is your first AT&T; device, it comes with a sim card and directions to set it up. If your current AT&T; phone already takes a mini sim, all you need to do is insert it in this phone. If you're like me and need a replacement, (but don't want to spend a small fortune on a new phone) then you can just slide in your old sim. My old sim card didn't fit, so I went over to the AT&T; store and they gave me one for no extra cost. To be clear, this works as a GoPhone or as a contract phone for existing plans.<br/><br/>When I renewed my contract with AT&T; late last year, I picked up the much lauded and excellent 41 megapixel Nokia Lumia 1020 (also a Windows Phone.) I had the phone 6 months before it was stolen, and unfortunately, I did not have ins... Read more
Last year, Nokia released the Nokia 520 and it became the best-selling Windows Phone of all time. Not only was it a great deal in terms of pricing, but it was also a great phone. So what could they do for a follow-up to their best seller? They released the Nokia 635, which improves upon several aspects of the 520.<br/><br/>That is what we have here in this review. First, let's discuss what a GoPhone is and what you can do with it.<br/><br/>There are two ways you can use a GoPhone. A GoPhone can be used with its included SIM card or with your existing SIM card. If you want to use it with the included card, you'll need to follow the activation process with AT&T.; The other option is to use an AT&T; SIM card you already have. If you need a backup phone, or broke your phone, and already have an activated AT&T; SIM card, you can pick up one of these and pop your SIM card in it. You do not need to do anything with the included SIM card if you use your existing SIM. In fact, there is a sticker on the back of... Read more
I got interested in the Windows Phone platform earlier in the year when I read great reviews of the Nokia Lumia 520 and read rumors about the changes in the upcoming WP 8.1. I picked up a 520 on the cheap to use as a backup phone, and just to see what the excitement was all about. It took months from the time I got my 520 to upgrade t0 8.1, but when it did, I was very impressed. There were only about two apps I missed when I switched over to the 520 full time from a Nexus 4--I'm a sucker for an underdog. Anyway, the 4" screen was a little cramped for my large hands, so when the 635 came out with a 4.5" screen, I didn't hesitate to make the move to it.<br/><br/>The transition from the 520 was fast and virtually seamless, involving restoring my apps and contacts from the cloud to the new phone with the push of a button. After the apps updated from the store, it was good to go. It even kept my wallpaper selection. The performance bump from the quad-core processor is noticeable. Apps load fast ... Read more
My Lumia 920 died on me, so I bought this as my 'filler phone' for when I ship off my good phone to get my next good phone.<br/><br/>In terms of screen quality, it's not the best, but it's not bad either. The original lockscreen they put on it makes it look fairly pixelated, but when you change it to a different photo, the screen res is good, and pixelazation doesn't stand out to me. The screen is bright, and vibrant, but suffers from bad viewing angles.<br/><br/>In terms of processor power, this actually beats the 920. My 920 was lagging a fair bit on the windows insider program (win 10 mobile). This phone has the power to run everything smoother, since it's a quad core chip vs a dual core. The downside is you only have 1/2 gb of ram, vs the 920 that had 1 gb.<br/><br/>Download speeds and update speeds are loads better than the 920. Especially for software updates.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great phone for the price, and it will remain my filler phone until it can't run the latest version of windows.
Apps are limited and no "selfie" camera or flash but good size screen and pretty good battery life so I'm really liking this purchase.
I am coming from an Apple iPhone 4s. Prior to that I had an iPhone 3s. Before Apple phones, I had Samsungs. Yes, the change to the iPhone 3s was amazing. And I really loved having the front-facing camera on the iPhone 4s. However, the only reasons why I had to really change phones from iP3s to iP4s was because the battery was dying and the iP3s couldn't quite keep up with the iOS updates. It's as if the updates were slowly making the phone more obsolete and draining its battery. Well, that is exactly what was going on with my iPhone4s. I could barely keep a charge on it for more than 4 hours. It would die at the most inconvenient times and I was frustrated with the new phone pricing plans from all three carriers that I would consider: AT&T;, T-Mobile, and Verizon. Who wants to lease a phone these days? And at crazy data plan prices? It just made me sick with the whole idea of having to have a cell phone.<br/><br/>What I really wanted was the Samsung Note 4! I always wanted a Note phone. I kn... Read more
This is my fifth cell phone in the past 6 years, and my second smartphone. I previously had the Nokia lumia 520 which I got back in the summer of 2013. I liked it at first and everything, however I dropped it and it smashed. The screen was very poorly cracked. Also, even before I smashed it, some of the side buttons were not working, and also it would never hold a decent charge. Like, I would charge it and then just texting or surfing the web for a little bit, would drain the battery about 1 percent per minute, if not more. Also the charger was crappy and would many times never charge the phone.<br/><br/>I have had gophone for 5 years now. I've never had a contract. Mainly because I am a student and I don't have the money for a real contract since I pay my phone. I do the 25 dollars a month plan which gives me unlimited texting and 250 talking minutes. It is perfect for me, since I hardly ever use my phone for talking. I just text, and use wifi for internet. I thought about switching to a c... Read more
I wanted to replace and old Motorola texting type of phone with a smartphone. My Go-phone expires on April 1,2015 so I opened my new Nokia Lumia 635 today and turned it on. It just shows the Windows logo on the screen(white quadrant box) but never shows the AT&T; start screen. The people at my AT&T; told me the phone is bad or defective. I bought a new phone from them for $49.99 and it loaded up and worked fine. Unfortunately I didn't open my new phone from Amazon and try to use it before the warranty expired so apparently I now have an extra battery and a useless phone. If you buy this phone or any other please make sure you open the product and check it immediately because they only give you 30 days to initiate a return or replacement. Sometimes it is best to use a local retailer so you have some recourse if something goes wrong.
Fantastic phone.  It stands head and shoulders above similarly priced smart phones.  Sturdy and reliable with excellent audio capabilities.
Awesome phone... I would give 5* but there is no front camera and no flash bulb. but other than that its definitely an upgrade for me.....
I use this phone all the time. It's a great low budget phone, but the only problem I had was there's not many games or apps in the store.
Really good one to use for any purpose - be it a phone, smart phone, GPS, browsing device...<br/>It is working good without any issues.
for $29.99 price, it is good budget. it is working on AT&T; and H2O wireless. very few apps for OS, but it is good enough for normal use.
Highly responsive (peppy CPU and good touch capable screen), light weight, big enough screen. Loved the fact that I could pop in an inexpensive micro SDHC (32GB for around $13) in to beef up my storage. Great camera and video capabilities (no front facing camera though). Using Skype or what's app is a breeze. Connects seamlessly to WiFi or 3G/4G. Bluetooth connection to car works like a charm. Also can connect to PC via USB or Bluetooth to upload pictures or video. Microsoft apps are very useful, especially I am an One note fan! Making a to do list or a grocery shopping list and pinning it to the main screen is such a treat! Battery life without Bluetooth is a few days so I have to charge 2-3 times a week. For the price I paid, it's a great value. Very happy with the purchase. I really hope Windows phone takes off so I can upgrade to another windows phone when I this one gives up on me whenever its life is over and I hope and think it will last at least 2 years.
After less than six months, the power button stopped working. Can't turn it on, can't turn it off, can't take screen shots. Ridiculous.
Nice phone for non-techies like my mom. Tiles make it easy to operate. Bought it and put it on our real AT&T; plan, saved a lot of $$$
This is a nice phone, I am leaving the iPhone 4 and bought this one to try it out and switch to another service provider. I played with it for 3 weeks before my other service expired. It is like a little computer on your phone, I like that. Then as I was doing my research on this phone, I found that the Lumia 640 is just a little bigger, has better camera on back and has a front camera too, also the battery is bigger. I like the size of the 635 to carry around while working. I got a great deal thru at&t; for the 640. After a few weeks of using these phones I am happy with both of them, saving the 635 for a back up in case I need it. Cortana is great too, I added a 64 gb micro sd card to each of the phones and that is the main reason I looked at this phone first. There are so many good things about this phone, I found an app for voice recorder, maps that I can use for gps, This is my first Windows phone and I am surprised and happy with it.
As ATT Gophone customers we're not power users.  We only use a cell phone for travel.  We use Ipod and Ipad on wifi.  The advantage for paygo on ATT is that they roll over the unused balances.  But they only allow the balance to grow to $500, a limit we've bumped into so we need to up or usage.  Enter the need for an inexpensive smartphone.<br/><br/>The Nokia 635 had good reviews for a phone in its price range and it well deserves them. I suppose if we had stepped down from an iphone instead of up from a flip phone we'ld feel different but we didn't and we don't.<br/><br/>Windows is easy to use.  We bought $5.00 worth of data and took a short roadtrip to see how it worked away from wifi and it was flawless.  Tried a GPS app and got good directions to our destination, 511.org gave us traffic, Google and facebook worked fine.  I guess there's fewer apps than for IOS and Android but we use our Apple devices for that sort of thing.
Best phone out there for the money. Just know there are not as many of the popular applications like for iPhone and Android users!
It works with my Cricket plan and sim card!<br/>I bought it as a replacement for the same exact phone and I'm satisfied with it.
If you want a $50 smartphone that has the speed to perform and good overall quality this is the phone don't regret getting this.
Still getting used to using a Windows phone. I think it has good reception for the price. I don't need all these icons though.
I have had this phone for 4 months and it got the job done until the last time I charged it. Then the phone would not turn back on. So I re-connected the charger and the phone came back on. I disconnected the charger and the phone stayed on and everything worked on it. When I attempted to turn it off, it would not go off. Then about 3-4 minutes later the phone turned itself off. Then it would not turn back on. The battery indicated a full charge the short time it was on. I took it to an ATT store and they said I would have to mail the phone to AT&T; to be repaired. I just wonder if anyone else has had this same problem with this phone and if there is any option I have before mailing the phone back to AT&T.;
Bought this when I dropped my Note II and had a few months to go for a replacement.  This cost almost nothing and all I had to do was pop in my simm card. Still have it months later.  The good: the windows interface is more informative and flexible than Android or IOS.  The screen is good and has all of the features that would make windows phones a big deal if they had apps. The downside no flash and the size of the phone.  The camera does not really need the flash and takes good low light pictures without it.  But no flash means no flashlight function and I have gotten used to it. On this size it is what it is, no surprise but I came from a note.  On the Windows Mobile platform: I really like it.  The interface with the exchange server is much better than the other two systems but some of the day to day apps I want (American Airlines, banking, and news) are missing.  Lucky I have a kindle.
I purchased this phone as an upgrade to a Nokia 520 i was using and in my opinion it wasn't much of an upgrade in fact it has been a downgrade.Although this phone has features and specs that the 520 does not have in my opinion the 520 is the better phone.I have had a few issues with this phone..The Battery drains quick (without having the display at the brightest setting) it has also shutdown on me for no apparent reason.it has dialed numbers on its own and while searching for something on the net it has closed the browser on its own several times ..In ending this review i will say that if anyone is on the fence about whether to purchase the Nokia 520 or the 635 in my opinion you should go with the 520.
It's OK if you like to charge your phone every single night even if you've not used the phone that day!!!!  Previously I had a Nokia to use with T-Mobile (we had to change carriers because our son went to college where T-Mobile receives ZERO reception)  anyway - the previous Nokia would last me all week - I only had to charge once a week.  This one has a very low battery life - it's this way on all 3 phones we purchased so it's not just one fluke of a defective battery.  I have no apps on this phone; it is used strictly as a phone - we use the 10 cents a minute plan.  To be honest there are days I don't even use the phone and the battery dies in less than 2 days - hence I have to charge it every night.  I guess you get what you pay for = $40.00 for a phone and the privilege of charging it every night - which means it is costing me the price of electricity every single night.
Surprisingly good phone. I have had many Androids that were more expensive and this phone is comparatively as good. No top of the line camera. No Android apps. But a great scaled down affordable phone with more than adequate Windows apps. I realm bought it for the price & was not expecting much. I am very happy with this phone. I've had phone that cost $600. There's nothing more irritating than dropping a $600 phone the minute you want to take picture of a cool spider and it jumps at you causing you to break your glass. So far, I have had this phone for a few months and have dropped it a few times against carpet and wood furniture. Still good. But even if I screw it up somehow, I still paid less than $60. I love it. If you a huge on movies, the screen is a bit small. Still very clear. You want the best, get an iPhone. You want acceptable for cheap $$, this is your product.
Can't beat this phone for the price. Always thought Nokia phones were top of the line phones. This one is very good.
Great product. very fast I am running windows 10 on it.<br/>Not too shabby for a phone with only 512 mb system ram
I got it as a secondary phone.. didn't need all that bells and whistles...so when it came up in the Lightning deals for 29.95 how can you go wrong? I've had several Nokia phones for the past 20 years so I had brand confidence... But the transition from my old nokia (with keyboards) to this windows format was very frustrating.  Had to explore a lot - hits and misses... used my computer to google the "How To's" like How To - transfer my contacts from my old phone.  Great apps available for free..<br/>The Good: if you use it long enough you'll get used to this windows format .... If you are already used to navigating on Windows 8 even better..<br/>The Bad: if you don't have much patience in learning an entirely new format and get frustrated easily.. this is not a phone for you.<br/>It's an ok phone for the price...
I was really surprised at the quality of this phone especially for the low cost barrier.<br/>-The phone itself is very slim and pretty lightweight.<br/>-Screen size is excellent and the quality of the screen is pretty good too.<br/>-4G LTE speed is very fast and it works great over AT&T;'s network. Additionally the Wifi is good on this device.<br/>-Phone is pretty fast and definitely a noticeable upgrade over the Lumia 520.<br/>-Call quality is excellent and the speakers and microphones work great.<br/>-Windows Phone 8.1 runs excellently and it really compliments this phone well.<br/><br/>Overall very satisfied with the purchase and I'll be using this phone for awhile. I highly recommend it to anyone who's looking for a cheap device off-contract or to anyone interested in trying Windows Phone 8.1 for themselves.

My Huaweii phone on Consumer Cellular was starting to have issues so I asked a friend what phone she had.  This phone has a fairly low SAR rating which is why I chose my previous phone.  I am new to the Windows phone and absolutely LOVE it over the Android operating system.  I honestly don't see myself going back.  This phone works great with Consumer Cellular.  If you are a Consumer Cellular customer, you may have to spend some amount of time with customer service to get the settings just right so that you MMS and internet work.  I bought two phones, one for myself and one for my mom and they used different settings.  So don't give up, just keep trying and you'll eventually get the right settings.  The camera isn't as good as my husband's iPhone, but it's tons better than what I had.  I also loved the great price.
My first smartphone. It has a lot of features I haven't utilized yet so I wouldn't be outgrowing it anytime soon.
Received the phone yesterday. It is a replacement for an iPhone 4s that my 12 years old son drowned in a pool at his summer camp because, as many other kids, did not believe when his dad told him that the waterproof cover from eBay was not really waterproof (China supplier).<br/>Now, the Nokia looks good, feels tough, but comparing it with Apple is by far not user friendly.  Maybe is because I have been an Apple customer for a while.  I still need to keep playing with the phone and then will have a more objective opinion for Windows phones.  Is very probably that my 12 years old son will learn how to use it before his old Dad, and for his own good better do it because there are no more iPhones for him until learning why Dads keep preaching all the time. Last but not least, for $47.00 I think it is perfect.
This is best budget phone for the fraction of price of an iPhone. It does lot more than premium phones at a budget price. The quality  of the phone and LTE connectivity is pretty good.<br/>+ FM Radio receiver<br/>+ LTE and GSM works globally<br/>+ removable sim, battery and SD card<br/>+ upgradeable to windows 10<br/>+ offline nokia here maps for navigation and offline mix radio for music.<br/>+ mirror your phone to any Mira cast receiver( I've tested with my Blue ray player and msft display adapter). No wifii required.<br/>+ Decent audio / sound<br/>+ Bluetooth pairs well with car and my portable speaker.<br/>+ Lumia play to app to view photos and videos on smart tv.(dlna)<br/>+ Lumia beamer for sharing screen on any smartphone that has internet.<br/>+ Customization of home screen  ;), tiles and background.<br/>+ notification and lock screen customization.<br/>+ no more mess like iTunes. Directly copy files from from PC to phone or SD card.<br/>+ File explorer allows moving files between phone and SD card<br/>+ store apps on SD card.<br/>+ seamlessly connected to MSFT cloud and sync's one drive content.<br/>+ tracks my walking and syncs to MSFT health account<br/>+ GPS tracking for running and offline navigation.<br/>+ remote to PC via remote desktop or team viewer app.<br/>+ comes with one note and office.<br/><br/>+ windows8.1 o.s is so smooth like butter with denim update and I 've got most of my apps except amazon instant video .:(<br/>+ Cortana voice assistant is smart and is too good .<br/>+ ok camera for the price.<br/>Update: I swapped the back battery cover with an orange one available at MSFT store for 8 bucks and instantly phone looking gorgeous now.<br/><br/>overall, I love this device...
The phone is very good at doing 98% of what you want a phone to do. With Windows Phone 8.1, MS has achieved feature parity with Google and Apple. For the money, the screen is very nice and is very readable in outdoor lighting. The processor is more than fast enough, and Windows Phone runs extremely well on the 512 MBs of internal memory. If you're a big gamer, you may want to wait for the 730 which, I think, is supposed to have 1 GB of RAM and will be more of an updated Moto G competitor. The LTE connectivity is great and phone call quality is very good as well. Being able to install a microSD card with up to 128 GBs of storage is outstanding.<br/><br/>It's biggest misses are the lack of a flash and a front facing, which take away from an otherwise outstanding entry level Windows Phone.
I purchased a Nokia Lumia 635 four months ago and continue to be impressed with the value I received for an inexpensive phone. I like the windows phone format. I will admit that there is a learning curve but I was able to figure out how to navigate through with an online instruction guide. My favorite feature is the ability to share my internet connection with other nearby devices. I can surf the internet on my tablet using the data connection of my cellular phone. I have been able to add all of my favorite apps to my phone and they work as well as my higher priced Samsung cellular phone. The phone has clear sound quality. I can even take great pictures and post them to facebook seamlessly.  I would highly recommend saving money and purchasing a Nokia Lumia 635 which is a great value.
Good. Should be like 100$ atleast so great price and works well after 3 months of use and dropping it 3 times
Good for a basic phone or backup, not so much for a daily driver.  Lousy display resolution and feels cheap.
Works great! Unlike alot of the reviews I read the camera is actually pretty good, and Cortana is wonderful!
Excellent phone.  Great large screen.  Easy to set up and use.  Loved it so much that I bought another one!
A downgrade from my T-Mobile HTC to AT&T; $50 Nokia 635.<br/><br/>First off the HTC is fine but the purple camera and battery life is less to be desired and T-Mobile is bad in my working area, so instead of getting a contract phone again I went to the prepaid AT&T; GoPhone and my god this phone is great in some areas. First the call quality is better than T-Mobile for less (Got the $45 Plan on ATT versus the $58 on T-Mobile) camera doesn't have that purple tint and the battery life is awesome! I'm a light user so I get between 2-5 days without charging! Yes there is no wide arrange of apps but only one I use is Instagram and that is it. With that said for a $50 phone to me it's better than my One M7 other than the front speakers and if it breaks I would buy again.
Nice phone as I use a Blackberry for primary. This is a great backup phone and Im happy with the features.
The phone is very good for the price. This phone has plenty of memory and very easy to use.very good buy.
This is an astonishing bargain.  I bought a $30 Lumia 520 earlier, and thought, "Meh - this is a $30 phone that feels like a $45 phone, yay."  But the 635 is a $50 phone that feels like a $300 phone.<br/><br/>Gripes:  (a) no dedicated camera button, which means that it takes a LOT longer to take a picture than it does with higher-end Windows Phones; and (b) only 512Mb of RAM, which only tends to bother me if I'm trying to browse the Web with several tabs open at once - it becomes obvious that it doesn't have the resources to keep them all in memory, so tabs have to get re-loaded a lot, making things feel sluggish.  (I realize that it's NOT particularly normal to have 5-6 browser tabs open at once on a phone, but hey, that's how I roll...)
The phone itself would be great, I really like the looks and basic operations. However, I am having a lot of issues with data connectivity and sometimes even my messages didn't send. I only got to know about this issue after buying it, encountering it, and browsing on forums about the same thing. Looks like it's a Nokia thing, a bug of some sort that has no real fix.<br/><br/>The connectivity issue is: I have paid for a data package through my provider (which I have been using perfectly fine with my previous Samsung device). At home I connect to my wifi, which works fine. However, when I leave home and switch to data usage, it seems to just not have internet at all most of the time - so I can't use it. I never have problems with calls though.
The price it batter then the store and the phone does so much that it will take time to get to know it
It's more than what I expected of a GoPhone & very nice quality. I'm really happy with my purchase :^)
Using the WDWS 8.1 format made it much easier to learn how to use my first smartphone. It is Great !!!
I'm a Windows Phone fan and this is a very good budget phone and thus one of the lightest Lumina's. It's light weight is the reason I purchased it directly from Microsoft. Just realize that AT&T; support for devices not sold directly by them is atrocious to put it lightly.  Microsoft released the "Denim" update for these phones in Sept. 2014.  AT&T; released the update only to the 635 model they sold themselves  in June 2015, with no word of whether or not they will release the update to the other 635 models (different SKU numbers although there is no actual difference in the phones). Microsoft has also stated that only the phones that have the Denim update will be eligible to be upgraded to Windows 10 mobile when it is released.
Probably the best no contract cell phone on the market.<br/>A quick tip: The phone comes loaded with Windows 8.0. If you have an existing Microsoft Account, don't sign in until AFTER you upgrade to Windows 8.1.  I did and was consistently seeing a prompt to update my birthday in my MS Account...this was preventing me from be able to install any apps on the phone.<br/><br/>I updated the account...but the phone and my Microsoft account do not seem to be in sync with that data; the prompt to update my birthday continued. I had to reset the phone back to default and once I did, I was able to get my MS account to sync correctly and download/install apps without issue. Anyway, this is a great phone for $40 and comes highly recommended.
Bought this back in December (Not from amazon mind you) and I got it for 60$, and I think it's worth it. Aside from no front cam, it's reaaally good.<br/>Only downside with a windows phone is the app store is not very good. As of right now, popular apps like Snap Chat are not on it. Instragram has a Beta app as of right now, but the app store is still lacking. The phone has an app called Nokia Mix Radio which is great! It's a little glitchy but it's great nonetheless.<br/>You should definitely buy a case for this, even though Nokia is said to be "tougher than diamonds" and what not, a case is still recommended.<br/>Dropped mine and the corner piece of the back panel got a bit warped. Screen protectors are a must as well.
I cracked the screen on my Lumia 830 so I bought this as a backup. Boy, am I impressed! So the camera is not as good as the 830's and it doesn't have a flash or a front facing camera, but for its price you can't beat this phone! The Lumia Selfie app resolves the lack of front facing camera, and even without the flash this camera (5MP) takes decent pictures. Windowsphone is a really cool OS and it grows on you if you give it a chance. Really wish Devs would support it better. I also think this the perfect size, not too big, not too small. The back shell comes out and you can buy different color ones for about $10. The green shell is pretty rocking I think. Almost forgot, the battery life on this thing is AMAZING!
Great little media device, second phone, or mid-range phone for someone who cannot afford a flagship. Great battery life. The preinstalled Mix Radio app is a nice addition. There is an occasional hiccup with apps crashing and is one of the small reasons I did not give this 5 stars (although that could be due to the app itself needs to be updated). I also would like a LED flash for the camera. Pictures are average but for social media it works just fine. There isn't a front facing camera, but they have a Microsoft has selfie app that uses tones to let you know that your face is lined up in the lens. For the price 49.99(no contract) and the ability to use an SD memory cards, it is definitely worth buying.
First off beware this phone doesn't have flash and really only takes good pictures outside in natural or in a bright room. It's an okay phone as long as you arent rough. Be sure to buy a drop resistant case. We have gone through 3 of these. If you sit on it in your back pocket the screen will crack and it will not ever work again.  Most phones you can still use if the glass has a minor crack.<br/><br/>Its an okay cheapy phone to get you through until you can upgrade or afford something better. Not a whole lot of apps/features might be a window's app thing.<br/>but you can use general smart phone functions. checking email, youtube and using the internet.<br/><br/>Also the speaker blows fairly easy.
More than I expect. New to smartphone and this is a great introduction to them. Very easy to use.
works on H2O, an ATT MVNO with no problem, so if you only want to use WiFi data, you can save money with a pay-as-you-go plan.  ATT does not like to set up these phones with a paygo plan, so I believe sometimes you have to fool them by setting up the plan with a different phone, then swap the sim card in.<br/>I wanted this phone because of the potential for off-line GPS driving instructions.  I just figured out how to do it, you have to download the maps.  There is not enough internal memory for the whole USA, so I just downloaded my state, have not figured out how to download map onto the microSD card.  It works great, very clear driving instructions, and easily found local restaurants by name.
Volume is low which hardly to hear it  when other noises are involves and even when I'm not too far from it.
Can't go wrong with $30 phone.<br/><br/>Best smartphone for $30 that anyone can get out there.
The volume on this phone is awful. I put it on speaker and still it's low.
This phone was bought for my 10 yr old great nephew. He calls himself a "geek" and it has enough bells and whistles to keep him happy,but not be difficult to use for his age.  The main reason I chose it was for the upgraded camera. He loves to take photos no matter where he is, and will always borrow some ones phone. He has a good eye and the quality of the pictures from this phone are excellent. .Also with a SIM card there was  no problem converting it to a network phone. the sound is clear and he can down load apps etc with ease. And the price couldn't be beat for a high rated phone with excellent reviews. I am pleased with it and so is my nephew which is all that counts.
Bought for my 15 year old son.  He has had now for about 3 months and it is working very well.
Good phone, no problems noted but I have only been using. It for a few weeks. Time will tell.
Right out the box this is a GREAT phone for the PRICE!<br/>The Nokia Lumia 635 operates just as efficiently as some of the more expensive windows phones.<br/>This is the 2nd time that I am buying a phone like this. My 14 year old has gone through two phones in the last year.So his "upgrade" is not an option!  This is where the price and "value" of a 40ish dollar phone comes in to place.<br/>So, we are using this as a replacement phone. The process is quick and easy for me to change out the phone myself. I simply pop out the sim card and memory card for the broken phone and insert it in the new one.<br/> If you are starting new service everything is included in the box, New sim card, charger and instruction manuals.<br/>The 635 is running win 8.1 and comes with Cortanna.  It has a 4.5" display screen so it is not small by a long shot. The battery life is wonderful even if you listen to music for hours. The only thing that the 635 model lacks in my opinion is a front facing camera. The front facing camera is available in other At&t; models.  It does have a rear facing camera that works fairly well, but does NOT have a flash option for the camera.<br/>I do recommend adding a micro sd card for extra storage space if you are running a bunch of apps. we currently have a 32gig, but you can expand up to a 64gig in this phone.  The App store is a little bit different than android's or apple's but they still have a ton of apps available. We have found that some of the apps crash. Not sure if it is the apps or the phone itself.  All of the pre-installed windows programs function well.<br/>So all in all way to go Microsoft for creating a wonderful budget phone!
Good phone, good deal, I am pleased and have been using it for months now with no problems.
This phone is a huge upgrade from the Nokia Lumia 520. I had that one and broke it so I decided I'd give this one a try. It's a huge difference, definitely worth paying more. It's very user friendly. I was amazed by the difference between the two phones. I'm glad I decided to upgrade to this one because I didn't like the 520 very much. I was an iPhone user for 6 years but my latest one had a hardware defect so I couldn't use it anymore. I really liked the iPhone but for the price difference, I might just stick with this. The only thing it doesn't have that my iPhone did is a front facing camera. This is not a huge deal for me because I don't take selfies.
I bought this phone as a replacement for my Lumia 920 as a hold over until the flagship phones come out in the fall. I am really surprised at the performance of the phone, it has a quad core processor that is much faster than the dual core 920. The only drawbacks are the camera quality is not as good as the 920 (5mp compared to 8mp), and that it only has 8gb of internal storage (only half of that is usable). Overall, for getting this phone for $50 off contract, this is way better than I expected.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Really Inexpensive<br/>-Very responsive and fast<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Camera is mediocre<br/>-Low Ram<br/>-Only 4gb usable storage
A nice phone for the price. Didn't put a data plan on phone but use the internet wi-fi and it works well. Gets good reception. Has a lot of stuff installed that I don't use very much and there is a sharp learning curve when going from a "remedial" phone to this one. Wish battery life was better. Have to charge it every day when being used a lot, but it will last a couple days when not used a lot (which doesn't happen often). I also bought a protective case and screen protectors. The case is a good idea. The screen savers seem to get scratched quite a bit but they are replaceable and at least the screen isn't getting scratched. Would buy again.
Arrived quicker than promised. Brand new. Swapped tthe SIM card and it is up and running!
At 79 I'm having a little trouble mastering it, but it's a wonderful phone for the price.
I waited for 3 months before writing a review for this. I am so happy with this product. I was forced to change from iPhone to this because after my iPhone 4s broke I did not want to spend a lot on a phone and also wanted a smartphone so I can have some basic applications like mail,Facebook,reader,Spotify,... so I took the chance and got this.If you are not familiar with Windows-phone I should tell you that you can have many of basic applications you need but compare to android and iOS you have quantity of applications is less.<br/><br/>* something I really like about this phone is the battery. it lasts at least 2-3 days for me ( medium use).
Better than the 520, but not without its issues.<br/><br/>This review is in direct comparison to the ATT Nokia 520.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>Longer battery life.<br/>Larger screen<br/>Volume levels better. Bluetooth devices (earpiece/portable speaker) noticeably louder. Direct connect earbuds/head phones (3.5 mm jack) noticeably louder.<br/>Camera noticeably better. Con, Still no flash.<br/>Faster boot up/processing speed<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Still somewhat buggy. Can lag when opening apps.<br/>Takes somewhat longer to charge. Pretty much a tradeoff for longer battery life.<br/>Microsoft still lacking in apps compared to Android/Google.
This important bit of information is nowhere in the description of this phone: It cannot be activated on a regular GoPhone plan such as the 10 cents per minute plan. It will only let you activate with the overpriced data plans of at least $30 per month. There is no possible way to talk to anyone in customer service, their automated system will just hang up on you. Sending it back.
I purchased this as an alternative to a table or new phone. I did not and have not set it up as a ATT phone. I connected it to my wifi at home and work to use as an MP3 player and video player. You can download, Hulu, Netflix and your own Microsoft music and videos. I use it for Spotify. I just added a microsd card and bingo, awesome. Do not purchase this for a camera only, you will be disappointed with the camera and selfies. Facebook isn’t as smooth on this device and or Instagram, but its OK. Theres no good Ultraviolet app on this except Flixster and that’s horrible. If you use Microsoft for your videos and music, this is awesome.
I had some problems initially ... but it turned out that my SD card was corrupted and would not show my pictures. I bought a new card and now it works without a problem. I am getting used to the phone now and don't miss my old phone (Huwaii - 850) at all. It was giving me such a fit, but now I am accustomed to using the commands on my Nokia Lumia 635 without a problem.<br/><br/>I am having a hard time finding any one game to download on my phone for entertainment. Most of them say they are not compatible to Windows. So I am continuing to search ... do you have a suggestion? I would prefer a card game or some kind of word game ...
One of the few phones designed with cost in mind. Windows phones works decently but it doesn't have the benefit of a widely developed for app store. Most notably apps missing are battle cats, tinder, and snapchat. Other then that the phone a micro sd card slot to add however much memory you need. Windows 8 is not as optimized or polished as say IOS and the specs of the phone are poor by phone standards. The main and only selling point is the fact that it is a fully functioning smart phone priced at sub $50. With its cheap price in mind, it does not feel cheaply constructed. Its worked without an issue for me for 1 year so far.
nice phone for the price.  works great.  I haven't really used it but my mom likes it.
After trying windows 8.1 for the first time... I forget what I saw in android phones.
I have had this phone for a few months now.  I like it a lot.  It is well worth the $50 I paid.  The call quality is good, the screen display is very nice, the GPS system stores maps on the phone, and I can add up to 128 gigs of storage with a micro sd card.  It runs smoothly, there have been no hang-ups or crashes so far.  Cortana is useful, but perhaps a bit over hyped.  MS is putting a lot of effort into improving her though, and I expect great things.  Though the app store isn’t up to the competitions, it has a very good selection.  I think this is a no brainer choice. Get it, even just for the GPS and MP3 player.<br/>Update3-14-15  Here are some cons:<br/>1 Here Maps won't let me mark a spot so I can find my way back to it.  Maybe it's possible, but I haven't found a way to do it.<br/>2. No sound enhancements like an equalizer for music playback. Maybe I just haven't found the right app.<br/>3. It's cheaper to use a no contract (GoPhone) than to sign a 2 year contract. What the hell, Thought I was getting a better deal till they added taxes and surcharges to my bill. Feeling a bit conned by AT&T.;<br/>Still happy with the device though.  My plan is reasonably priced, the phone is quite capable, and it's a $50 smartphone!<br/>Edit:  Found how to mark a spot on my Here Maps app. just touch and hold. Had this for nearly a year and quite happy with it.
This is an excellent phone if you do not need a lot of bells and whistles.  Got it today and it is exactly as billed.  It's just not logical to finance a phone over two years.  I would always buy the reconditioned phones over the last 10 years until the carriers decided they could make their money on the phones instead of the plans.  I have this phone because my HTC ONE X face glass broke twice.  Its easy to use once you fiddle with it a while.  Taking pictures is a set back if you're a narcissist that is in need to constantly take selfies.  In closing, nice phone, easy to operate, very economical. Anyone who pays hundreds of dollars for a new phone every two years, needs their head examined.
Ordered the phone on Monday was at my front door by Friday. Opened the phone, slide in my sim card and sd card, the battery. It started up found my network and my sim card. Could make calls right away and texting. Did have to set up the APN settings for the MMS and the Internet, but you would to do that for any sim phone. LTE works great. Calls are clear and loud. The speaker is amazing loud. Bluetooth hooks up to everything I have tried connecting to it. I have not felt any real lag with any of the programs. The battery life has lasted me from 5 am until 10 pm with plenty of life left on it. Great little phone.
Amazing phone for this amount of money.<br/>Device is working fast, so far with no lagging. Phone ringer is loud as soon as you will peel off protective film from the back cover.<br/>Screen resolution is not bad.<br/><br/>On negative side, there is no front (self) camera and the rear one is pretty bad especially in the low light condition.<br/>Windows store lucks even basic applications paid or free ones that available for Android and Apple phones. No app for chromecast stick.<br/>Yet for this amount of money is Okay, except luck of front camera.<br/>Would buy it again and would recommend to a friend.
This is my second Lumia phone. I am personally a whole hearted windows lover and this phone is everything I could ever want. I love dropping it around my friends with android and iPhones and then indicating to everyone "oh look. The screen didn't crack. Oops. Did it again. Hmm...still works." They clutch their glass screened phones in their protective cases with discontent. It's fun. Actually, my last windows phone survived a dog chewing on it, multiple drops on concrete and tile, and a plunge in the toilet. Good luck iPhones! I look forward to seeing what my new windows phone survives.
Love this phone.  Much easier to use & more intuitive with Win 8.1 than Android based phones (haven't tried iphones).  Good screen with text that is large enough to read easily.  Not a big fan of ATT, but they were very helpful in switching from an old flip phone to the 635.  Needed a case for it as it gets carried in pockets.  Was a bit unsure about the Iceland case for the 635 since it hadn't been reviewed, but turned out to be just what I needed.  Unlike a lot of the cases that were reviewed, all the 635 ports, switches & other openings line up perfectly and don't impede use of the switches.
This is honestly a great phone. I bought 2, one for both of my parents. Very nice smart phone. I don't want to call it an entry level smart phone because with the features and speed of this product it deserves a higher ranking than that. Definitely not a top tier phone but anyone looking for something that they can have all the features of a great smart phone look no further. Price is incredible. Battery is great. Screen quality is not full HD but is definitely not bad. There is no selfie camera but other than that it is perfect. And it has the latest version of Windows which is a huge plus.
Pretty decent phone for the price. Missing a front facing camera which I wanted to use once, but the selfie app worked pretty well. Running windows 10 beta on it, relatively stable but would definitely like some more power on my daily driver. A cheap replacement for my 920 while I wait for the next round of windows phones to come out.<br/><br/>Note: You will need to get an SD card, there isn't much room after updates, and while it won't error our or warn you, it does struggle when you get low on memory, so I offloaded all non-daily apps and games and music to an SD card and it does well.
I purchased this phone in June and now for some reason even though the phone is fully charged, the on/off switch is not working. The only way that I can turn on the phone is to plug in the cable. That basically makes this phone worthless. At the Nokia website, when I enter the phone's IMEI (serial number) to find out if it is under warrantee, it shows as "Out of warrantee in the US", even though the warrantee should be good for 12 months. I don't recommend buying this phone with only a 30 day warrantee.
Wow, what a disappointment.  I actually purchased this phone just to see if I would like a windows phone over an android phone.  If all windows phones are this bad I will never switch over!  What a piece of crap.  If you have to click anything around the edges you almost have to break through the glass to get it to register that you are clicking it.  It also has a mind of its own, closes windows right in the middle of working on things.  This thing is worth about $4.99, so I hope no one pays full price for it!
Phone is really nice for what I paid for it! I received the phone in a timely manner and it was as expected. It took awhile for me to get the hang of the Windows layout, but I'm getting there slowly. My biggest issue is that I wish that I had access to playstore or could at least download android apps because while the Windows apps are okay, they don't include a lot of popular apps that android and IOS have access to, so that may be a deal breaker for you. I ordered from Amazon directly ( meaning I chose Amazon the seller, not just a fulfillment by Amazon seller) and am pleased thus far.
I caught this phone on sale for $30! I snapped it up since my family needed a second phone. I was a little skeptical since it got some bad reviews, but for $30 I couldn't pass it up.<br/><br/>It's sturdy, has great sound, takes really awesome action pictures (Almost like a gif) with the built in app and we've had absolutely none of the issues that I was worried about. It took a little bit to get used to a Windows phone since we previously had other brands of OS.<br/><br/>We also love the way the gophone service is set up. It's affordable and we can pay right from the phone itself.
this is the first smart phone I've owned and I have to say it's been a real struggle.  it's been so hard to find anything-the little icons at the very bottom do not tell you which one you might want to get you to the right place.  I do not enjoy searching and searching.<br/>I'm sure the actual phone works fine it's just the mechanics of how to work it.  I'm just about to chuck it and go back to my simple but easy to use phone-and the screen isn't all gross with one touch.<br/>So, unless you've already experienced att smart phones, there might be a more user friendly one out there.
Great phone. Easy to setup and use. I recommend it for a new smart phone user.
pack of awesomeness for just $39.99 without a contract.<br/>Thank you amazon!
The 635 was a good choice for fans of Windows phones LAST year, but it has now been replaced by the FAR superior Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE with an excellent five inch screen, dual front and rear cameras, high speed 4g LTE data, and a long life battery.  The 640 LTE sells for just $60 at neighborhood AT&T; stores and for $40 at MetroPcs stores.  It will receive a free upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile in December.  The 640 LTE outperforms many phones selling for $200 or $300 for a tiny fraction of their price.  And that is why my $200 Android phone is getting dusty on a shelf.
This is a step up from my 520. I bought two and my dad bought two. We are all having great luck with them. The screen is really clear and easy to see. There is more apps available than ever but once in a while I still find something where one is not available. The windows program is very easy to use and my elderly parents are running them easy as a first smart phone. It works great with my computer and hot mail. The only issue we have is the SD card slot in my wife's phone is not working. It was well worth the money and we all keep finding new things on them.
Love it. Really love it! Couldn't ask for more. Plan to buy one for my wife.
I bought this phone for my husband. I'm a Samsung snob but my husband goes through phones like they're free so I bought him this phone because the price is SO low.  It has a great light weight feel, good color, and sound.  I gave it 4 stars because it's kind of difficult to personalize and the home screen is really packed with apps and such. If you are comfortable with Windows interface you will have no problem with this phone at all. I would recommend this phone to anyone who wants a smart phone that is not expensive but looks and operates as if it is!
Better than I imagined it would be.  I would compare it to any smart phone.
Fantastic phone for what it is for smartphones under the category that fall under $100. I cracked the screen on my Lumia 1520 and did not want to shell out money for a replacement, so I went with this. The process for restoring contacts, text messages, apps was super smooth.<br/><br/>If you damaged your high end lumia and need something quick to hold you over, go for this.<br/><br/>If you are new to Lumia and want a phone that is going to run smooth and don't care about having a high end camera, then this phone is for you. Battery life is great.
I absolutely love this phone! The battery life is great. I get about 2-3 days on it and that with making calls and playing with it. I really wish Cortana was easier to use but she's not too bad. Customizing my ringtones was a bit difficult. I needed to download a ringtone maker to make the ringtones i wanted. Service is amazing! I never get any service in my home and with the Lumia I can talk anywhere. And I love love love the tiles! Everything I use is right there on my homescreen. Really great phone and great provider. Will deffinately but again.
For $100 I expected much less. This thing is fast and light and the screen is nice to look at. Coming from a L900 running WP7.8 I was tickled with all the new features and apps available in the WP8.1 OS! It lacks things that I hardly ever use (selfie cam, gyro, compass LED), which is how they got it down to $100. It has things I care about (LTE, quad core, larger screen than L520, SD card expansion, better camera than L900). Could it be better? Sure, but not for $100!
i've got it in very good condition. phone is very good.i liked everything. screen colors, zippy performance without any lag. camera takes nice shots.<br/><br/>pros:<br/>1. design and screen size<br/>2. display colors<br/>3. super fast cpu ; adreno 305 gpu<br/>4. 8GB storage, mSD up to 128GB<br/>5. amazing battery life<br/>6. good call and speaker quality<br/>7. sensor core is best for workouts<br/><br/>cons:<br/>1. no proximity sensor<br/>2. auto brightness sensor<br/>3. front camera would be better, but don't pay attention.
Excellent purchase. A full featured, well built phone for an incredible low price. I love Windows Phones, they perform well and don't demand the hardware Android requires those days. Plus, it's not Google.<br/><br/>Recommend this phone, or the newer and larger Lumia 640 model to anyone who wants a good phone for a reasonable cost. Unlocked the device and is now running on our Canadian cell provider. AT&T; offers excellent service and affordable pay as you go service in the States. Wish they would come to the Canadian market as well.
Fiance loves it. Can't believe how good of a phone it is for 50 dollars!
It's amazing how much they could pack into a device sold at this price!!
still getting used to it but seems like a lot of phone for little money.
These are the cheapest smart phones, can't beat the price. Bought two older models last Christmas for 29 dollars and bought two more for gifts this year.  We only have them hooked to wifi and just had our sim cards moved over from our cheap old phones (dumb-phones). At first we didn't mind the Windows OS, but it has become limiting as a lot of the Android/Ipad apps aren't available for Windows and I don't see this getting any better . . . ever!  But all in all, for a better than basic smart phone this is a great little phone.
I have been very impressed with this phone. It has been very reliable & responsive. I like the fact that I can choose to save files to a micro SD card. This is not something you can do with an iPhone. I also like the way the phone interacts with Outlook online. If you have a hotmail or Outlook account, you can have files save automatically to your One Drive, which is free data storage.<br/><br/>Another nice thing about this phone is that you can use it as a GPS without even having an account or phone chip. How cool is that?
I really like this phone I can do so much with it. I have downloaded all my favorite apps and have arranged them in order of usage. The only part that I have trouble with is when I receive an incoming call I have to slide the outer cover up before I can answer the call, thus causing me to loose the call because I am not able to slide this cover up quick enough,but that is something I am working on. I love everything else about the phone, all the features and the preloaded apps and I would recommend it to family and friends.
Awesome phone, I love this device and the price point cannot be beaten.
I only paid $99 for this Windows Phone 8.1 with no contract. I used my AT&T; nano sim card out of my iPhone 5 and used a micro sim card adaptor to install it in the Lumia 635. The windows phone is working fine and I can switch back to the iPhone at any time.  I liked the new Lumia 635 so much I bought a used Lumia 1520. Switching sim cards is a nice way to have several phones without having to signing up for a long term contract. Make sure you have the correct sim card size with correct carrier for your wireless service.
Not a heavy smart phone user--it fact I hardly ever use it as a phone, though it worked great the couple times I did.  The screen is bright and clear, the sound is surprisingly loud and clear.  The touch screen is very easy to use.  Windows 8.1 is very well designed, intuitive and easy to use.  The battery lasts all day easily.  I downloaded a couple of e-reader apps from the Windows store, and now using it as a reader is the main thing I do with it.  It's more than satisfactory for me, and a bargain at the price.
Dollar for dollar, this phone is a deal.  Not going to wow you with it's low to midrange specs, but it's reliable and reasonably fast.  Takes decent pics in good lighting.  Nice color saturation on the screen.  Perfect size for handling and pocketability.  Because it's a Windows Phone, you can plug it directly into your pc and copy/paste music, movies, and files directly to the phone.  MicroSD card slot for expandability.  Great backup phone if you are waiting for your contract to expire on your cellular carrier.
I have only had this phone about 5 hours and it's already so much better than the Motorola atrix 2 I have been dealing with for almost a year. Some glitches with my windows login info but after that got straightened out(forgot my password lol) just downloading apps I use is so much faster!!! I look forward to further customizing it!! If you have a net10 bring your own number sum card(dual is best with this phone since it takes the mini SIM card) the att go phones work best with it! I am SO happy with this phone!!
This is the right phone for a teenager.  Drop it?  Break it?  Replace it for cheap, use a microSD card for storage and just transfer that over, and Windowsphone software moved all the contacts and apps to the new phone automatically.  I have one for my six year old son too, for some learning games, videos in the car (get a headrest mount), and music for night time (Pandora sleepy-time kids station works well!)  Too bad there's not a decent Amazon store, Amazon Music, or Amazon prime streaming video app yet.
The phone is great for the price! You can't get anything better than this.<br/>Personally I like Windows Phone, so the OS isn't a problem for me.<br/>The reason why I didn't give it 5 stars it's because I can't get any software update.<br/><br/>PD: I am from Mexico and I'm using the phone flawlessly with Movistar after unlocking the phone./ Soy de México y uso este teléfono perfectamente con Movistar después de desbloquear el teléfono (creo que también funcionaría con Telcel, pero no puedo asegurarlo).
Couldn't resist the price. Switched the whole family to these phones and we absolutely love them. There is not a better smartphone for the price anywhere in the Northern Hemisphere!  Easy to set up and transfer from our old iPhones and a million times the battery life!  Wow, what a phone.  Simple to use and it does everything we need a smartphone to do. It was a good phone at $119.00 when they first brought them out, but now? Boy what 40 bucks will get you these days. Great phone; could not be happier!
finally got a cell phone. love the phone,easy to set up easy to use.
So far its been good. Great inexpensive budget phone to have around.
Shipped quickly and it was a great gift for my husband.! He loves it
This was a great replacement phone for my daughter.  She had been using a low end zte android that just wasn't cutting it due to its lack of onboard storage and slow processor.  This windows phone is snappy and does everything she needs.  No selfie camera, bit I don't mind that.  I added a large micro sd card so it has lots of storage for music.  Her old phone was a standard SIM card, but I called AT&T; and they transferred the account to the mini sim that came with the phone.  Took about 15 minutes.
Bought this a replacement phone for my MIL, as she dropped her other one in a mud puddle. She has a contract with ATT, but we were able to contact ATT and switch her service to the SIM card that came with the phone. Great way to get her a newer phone without a contract or ridiculous price. It's slightly bigger than our iPhone 5S. It's really lightweight. But overall, not a bad little phone. You don't have very many options for Apps since it's a windows phone, but she doesn't use them anyways.
Overall functions are adequate. There are just enough little things that I would not recomend it.<br/><br/>No flash? I know it's a known fact so why hold it against them....who doesn't use their phone as a flash light from time to time anymore. I can't imagine that adding an led to the back would cost that much.<br/><br/>The auto volume to 13/30 was annoying. I used it as an iPod and at random intervals it would drop the volume, and always when I was driving. I wish I could turn that off.
I have had this phone for nearly a year now and really like it. I was able to upgrade from Windows 8.0 to 8.1 earlier this year, with no problems. The tiles are easy to customize and use. The camera works really well, though doesn't have a flash. Occasionally emails take a while to be delivered, though that hasn't been a problem. I use the radio a lot and appreciate the sound quality from this device. Overall, this phone is a good bargain for the price, and is easy to use. I recommend it.
Great phone and top notch customer service ten star 🌟 if u ask me
I luv this smart phone - still smarter than me, but I can work it!
it worthies the price. And works great for me so far,no complaint.
Recently received this phone.  So far so good.  Love the features.
Very good budget phone for AT&T.; Great for kids. Great as a back up. Great if you don't need all of the options. Just a great value for the price.<br/><br/>No it doesn't have a flash and no it doesn't a front facing camera. Some parents would prefer that their childs phone not have a front facing camera.<br/><br/>Not everyone will love Windows but this will be able to be updated to 10. Hopefully that will also fix the small app store options.<br/><br/>This can be unlocked by AT&T.;
Bought this phone for my daughter who was set on an iPhone. For months that was all I heard, but with those being so expensive and her only being 10, I thought we would go in another direction. She is IN LOVE with this phone!! The only con to it is that I can't seem to get the camera to turn to front facing while using Skype. But that's not really a huge issue. We loved the phone so much I bought 2 more for my husband and myself.. Nokia is absolutely one of the best brands hands down!!
I can hardly believe how much quality I am getting for my money! Windows 8.1 works beautifully! I have always used a contract Android cell phone, tired of the contracts, tired of the supposedly great deals on the contract phones, do the math and your paying dearly for those phones, ( last contract phone I had was a Galaxy S3 ) this phone works great and I'm so glad I bought it! Not hard to switch from Android to 8.1 windows, same OS as your home PC. Try one you will be happy you did..
Phone runs great, came super quick. Using as a chrome cast remote
**Update:  Culprit is an extremely poor wireless adapter on the chip.  When I'm right next to the router, speeds are fine.  Oh well, guess you can't expect much for $40.  Phone is OK aside from this issue.<br/><br/>Not sure if I just got a bad unit, but had an incredibly weak wi-fi signal to the point where simple internet browsing would take 15-20 seconds to load each page.  Speed tests would show sufficient speeds on the phone (20Mb down/10Mbit up), so the issue definitely wasn't with the speed at which the phone could receive data in synthetic speed tests.  It was just incredibly slow to browse (tried multiple browsers).  Going to return it.  Maybe I'll have more luck with the Lumia 640.
What a great phone for the price. It is low end as for the camera, no flash, no camera button. But it performs very good for 512 ram and the processor it has. Given the fact that you can use an SD card (I have 32 gb) and ATT unlocked it for me for free in less then five minutes online no phone calls no hassles. I am planning on buying 3 more just for the kids to have without phone service. But I use this one on Straight Talk, Indigo, ATT and going to try it on Consumer Cellular.
It's simple, light, and despite a newish case it still holds up to Nokia toughness, kinda...I've dropped it plenty of times and it keeps going.<br/><br/>Problems thought...most of the time watching youtube videos don't work out too well. When listening to visual voice mail you can't stop it or delete it til it's done playing all the way through unless you lock your phone and open it back up and delete it that way.<br/><br/>Other than that...good phone for 60 bucks.
This is a great phone if you have network access at home with a decent security company that cleans the system for you. There are some cookies that can hurt the phone but if you have a respectable internet security company and clear the cookies out on a regular basis. You can get away with going with out a network for at least 3 months without worrying about malware, spyware, and all the bad things the internet has to offer. Stay away from windows 10 build 10536!!!
I am not big into phones, but for the price this phone is fantastic. It does what I need, email, web browsing, and calling folks.  The camera is better than I expected. Just don't expect Iphone quality pics. The battery is the longest lasting I have ever used. While I like android OS, Windows 8.1 is very easy to use.  Their app store is limited, but I really don't care.  I have my Google tablets for that stuff. Overall, it does what I need and would buy again.
Bought this phone for overseas visitors.  Works great, took 10 minutes to set up phone with included mini SIMs card.<br/>Fast, responsive.  Never had a windows 8 phone.  Easy.  The windows OS has similar issues to iOs.<br/>GPS doesn't require data service availability.  Very nice phone ... and for <$50 ... insane!<br/>The reasonable service costs for this phone costs $45 per month (unlimited calls, texts and 1.5 GB data service bandwidth @ 4G LTE
Is very good,my firends is like it,thanks amazon.I am Chinese
This is a very nice phone at an amazing price. I recommend it
Well, if you are a windows 8.1, or Windows 10 devotee....you iz gonna love this phone!<br/>Feature rich, speech to text, GPS, Maps, MS Office...... sick!<br/>$40.00....Whatttt!!!!!!<br/>I absolutely love this phone, does it all and then some!<br/>Microsoft hater, are ya!  Then do yourself a favor and get something else!<br/>Get a glass screen protector, a hybo-ragged HD Hybrid protective cover and you got yourself a bonafide personal data grenade!
This phone is a great value. I am only disappointed by the lack of app's. The Bluetooth seems to integrate perfectly with my Motorola Roadster 2, so I get all the features from that also. The Waze App crashes all the time, but the HERE App is a pretty good replacement. Phone call quality is great. Signal strength is top notch. Cortana is actually pretty good, but she has a hard time recognizing my girlfriends name...<br/>I really recommend this phone.
I really love the phone and I am now going on a full year with the phone and it is durable and amazing. My only hiccup with the phone is that it does not send/ receive pictures or videos on text messaging. I have to go through my email to get photos and videos. For some reason only the messaging doesn't get videos or pictures. Battery is fast at charging and the phone is very easy to work with. Would definitely recommend to family and friends to buy.
It's an excellent cellphone at this unbelievably low price. The Windows Phone 8.1 system is quite good, and it operates well in the 512M RAM device. It almost doesn't heat, and the battery usually lasts more than one day, even though it's only 1830 mAh. The Apps are not so few or so bad as I thought it might be. If you know the shortcomings of the phone in advance, and still decide to buy it, I'm sure you will be surprised what a good deal you get.
I cant believe how amazing it is ( for 50 dollars, its wonderful)<br/>If all you need is facebook, text, phone call, bluetooth, small apps, general quality photos, stop reading and buy it.<br/>If you need to play games, stop reading and do not buy it. It doesn have enough RAM to support games.<br/>It is fast as long as you dont give it too much too calculate.<br/>btw, it doesn't have a front camera and get a little hot after 10 minutes talking.
a better version of lumina 520.<br/>looks better, has better screen<br/>dousnt drain the battery as much<br/>and unless your doing heavy gaming, the phone does not turn into a portable oven top... a very big problem for lumina 520.<br/>the only downside, besides being a windows phone is that there is no picture button. however, if you pin the camera to the start page, its not that big of a deal. other then that its alott of bang for your buck
The phone is great. Wish the packaging was less frustrating.
I love windows phones and I had no issues with the Lumia 520; I just bought this one in December because I wanted a bigger phone. My mom had the typical restart issues with her 635 but I didn't however, in May my phone started sapping chargers left and right. I have been buying replacement chargers every two weeks. I'm feeling a little irate because I haven't even had this phone for a year. I don't know if anyone else is having the same issue?
This is a terrific "phone" - really, small tablet - for my 10-year-old daughter.  She doesn't need a phone yet, but she wanted to look like she has one, and to be able to use kid-friendly apps while she's home in WiFi range.  This inexpensive product has been reliable and durable; it takes passable pictures; and the Windows phone OS is arguably more intuitive and stable than prior versions of Android.  I'd get it again in a heartbeat.
Awesome phone have it synced with my windows 10 computer with one drive easy to share photos videos ect. It's pretty fast the video quality is great. Windows doesn't have as many apps as android but has enough for me. The battery life is good, Camera works great. Over all best phone under $100. Has a quadcore processor. I can read books watch movies/shows surf the web play games all fine. Call quality is fine same with texts. I recommend it.
I ordered these two phones for my little brothers (twin monsters).<br/><br/>They enjoy the phones very much and even ordered durable cases from nakedcellphone.com.<br/><br/>Make sure that during setups that you do not enter a birthday under 18 or it will enable child protection/parental control features on the phone, which can be annoying.<br/><br/>I have a Lumia 1020, but these phones are still great in my opinion for basic needs.
For the price, this is a very good phone, with a wide range of applications and features.  Bright screen, and good sound capabilities.  Some annoyance are the short battery life and the limited ring tones.  I bought this for a low price to use with a no contract AT&T; prepaid arrangement.<br/>So far, the phone has worked very well.  The camera is not as good as it could be.  And, as mentioned before, the battery is very limited.
Works perfectly with Consumer Cellular.  All I had to do was to insert the SIM card from my old phone and added the "Consumer Cell" to the "Cellular+SIM" settings.  My Windows "NEST" thermostat app doesn't work as well as it did on the Android phone but I can manage it well enough.  It takes great pictures and great videos as well.  Battery lasts for two full days (unlike any Android phone I ever had).
I love my phone suits my every need.  i have fun with it!
Totally what I expected and more 😏, I'd buy it again 👍
I HAD A NOKIA 920 AND IT DIED IN 8-10 HOURS. ONE S 635 HAS LASTED ALMOST 2 1/2DAYS. THE REVIEWS I READ WERE  EXCEPTIONAL BUT DID NOT BELIEVE IT UNTIL I PROVED IT FOR MYSELF.  IT HAS GREAT  SOUND, BATTERY LIFE AND STORAGE.  I AM NOT AN APP PERSON BUT WHAT I DO USE HAS BEEN GREAT.  I HAVE TOLD ALL MY FAMILY AND FRIEND PLEASED I AM.  I AM AN SENIORSENIOR SO I NEED A PHONE THAT IS EASY TO USE, THIS IS IT.  THANKS NOKIA.
Works with my by the minute plan and with wi-fi I don't need to use minutes to check email ect.I added a 128 gig memory card and now have a phone that holds almost as many songs as my 160 gig ipop classic and does so much more for half the price I need the storage for my extensive music collection so the amount of available storage was a major consideration and now don't have to carry 2 devices I'm pleased so far.
Arrived on time.<br/>Brand new, as advertised. The phone came in its original package. Not problems at all with the vendor.<br/>The phone, on the other side, gets hot every time I use it or charge it.<br/>And I have some problems downloding or playing some apps.<br/>Not problem making phone calls, texting, getting or sending emails.<br/>Is not the best phone, but for the price you pay.... you got a good deal.
works great, my 1020 got bricked by win10 and I got this until the 940xl comes out...  just put my standard sim in it and it worked no problem, you don't have to activate the prepaid sim and pay all that extra money, just put you standard sim in it and it works fine<br/><br/>it's got a different build of 8.1 than the 102 and works great, ultra cheap at $40 for a 4.5 inch screen and decent camera....  great deal
Bought this for wife who is not techie. Knew there would be a learning curve. First phone we got would not send/receive pictures. After finally trying all the different settings figured that this phone had to go back. Took a replacement and this second phone seems to be working a lot better. Moral of the story?? Hope you get a phone that works because trying to teach/learn on a broken phone is a pain in the ass.
I bought this as an upgrade from my other Nokia Lumia (520 maybe?) and it works well.  The camera is not as good as my previous model, it takes a long time for the camera to focus and the quality of the photos are not as good.  It also randomly turns off and turns back on every once and a while which is annoying, but it doesn't do it often enough to cause me any problems.  Overall, I think this is a good phone.
I must admit I was somewhat skeptical at first but now I love this phone. It's extremely fast and loud just the way I like it. Call quality is excellent and the speaker phone feature works exceptional. I'm use this phone daily and not my Samsung galaxy note 2. The phone size is just larger than the IPhone 5s. The battery is good all day even with heavy usage. It's the best cheap phone I've ever purchased!!!!
The phone is great. The quality of pictures the camera takes is super compared to all the other cheap phones. If you only need the phone for texting, calls and basic app usages, it'll be perfect for you! It's cheap and it's simple, and it's good quality. But if you want certain Android apps, the Microsoft app store is most likely to NOT have it. So make sure you know what functions you want from your phone.
It's a nice phone but when you are used to Android it takes a little getting used to.  Can't seem to fine as many programs and apps like I had with Android but phone works good and thanks great pictures considering it has no flash.  And Facebook and email are easy to set up and access. Great phone for the price and I am using it as replacement for at & t phone on account. I like it as a replacement for now.
Good phone.  Just wish I knew how to use it better lol
Well, I am here to tell you that I am an older person and I would recommend this phone to anyone, no matter their age!  My daughter and I both phave this phone and it is a blast to have. I had android for a long time then decided to see what nokia had to offer. Sometimes I think about going back to android, but am having way to much fun with my wonderful windows phone(nokia lumia 635). Very niçe phone.
I got this phone for my son. If you need a phone that only calls ,then it's a good phone for the price. However,  he likes to download apps and we haven't been able to download any. We've tried to contact customer service ,but keep getting different people who don't know how to fix the problem.  I wished I would've sent a little more money to get him an android phone or one that downloads apps easily.
Bought this for my boyfriend. The phone is very responsive and i have zero issues with the speed. The memory is expandable up to 128GB which is perfect for my boyfriend who stores a lot of files and apps. The camera is not great at all, luckily my boyfriend is not a camera nerd, but I was sad because it is really grainy. Not a fan of the sound quality too. Its too soft. I guess this phone is so so
I purchased two of these Lumia 635 phones for my preteen kids.  The phones are fast with a very clear display.  The sound quality is decent and even comes with a built in radio, GPS system, and personal assistant called Cortana.  The camera takes nice pictures but unfortunately there is not a front facing camera.  Other than the lack of a front facing camera, the phone is an awesome for the price.
Good battery life, a little hard to hold with fully beveled sides. Had problems configuring APN and MMS to work with Consumer Cellular. Finally went back to Droid phone.  Not impressed with Windows 8.1 operating system and had hopes to upgrade to Windows Phone 10 but that doesn't seem like it will happen in the near future. REALLY missed having front and back facing cameras for Skype contacts.
Great phone if you want to use even as a non phone. Can install apps and run without much issue (unless its a memory hogging app).<br/><br/>I use this as a music player and backup navigation unit (Sans Gps). Even works as a backup Usb stick if you have a cable. Drag and drop files on the go.<br/><br/>Great build quality and battery life (assuming a lot of wireless/radio is off like mine).
Great phone for the money. Screen is good, performance is good, call quality is great. Other than App store, which everybody knows by now how it is, I have no complains.<br/><br/>Good things are the Nokia built quality, very good battery life and for me the ideal phone size. Not too small and not too big. Camera is actually not that bad honestly. All in all it is a great deal as of now.
One of the best phones I have ever owned and the prices were great. I'm not a smartphone user really, but I decided to go with this phone being that it was one of the cheapest phones I could find to replace my defective phone which actually happened to be a flip phone that costed almost the same price. I am VERY happy with my purchase so far. It has all of the options I need plus some.
good phone it is windows and you can use most apps.
Sweet phone for the price. It's not a top of the line phone, but it gets the job done. and the quad core processor is really nice. I have had no drawbacks with this phone.<br/><br/>I just miss a few things on other smartphones I have had, such as a front-facing camera and a brightness sensor. But Other than that it is awesome. great for if you broke you phone while under contract.
$29 and unlocked it in one day for $1 dollar online. I then bought a case for $6 dollars including screen protector.. so for the price plus tax I got this phone unlocked for $40 with case and screen protector. Guess what I bought 2 so I have two unlocked phones with screen protectors  and 2 case  4GLTE gps and 4.5 inch screen quad core processor gps and more.. 2 for 80 unlocked nice
my ipod touch bit the dust and i didnt want to spend $400 on new one.  This one syncs with itunes,  plays music as well as an ipod (I actually like the music app better) and costs only $40.  Another $50 for a 128 gig microsd card and i saved $300.<br/>dont need to activate, other than  message abut a missing sim when it boots up it doesnt need to be connected to a phone network.
this is a great cell to have for 50 dollars. it is a nice smartphone with all the basic needs covered and win 8 apps are getting better and better. my only concern is the battery lifespan but these days every phone has the same issues. buy it if you dont want to spend 200 dollars + 2 year plan of slavery. Just pay 30 $ per month for calling and messaging and for the rest use WiFi
I absolutely love this phone. The only thing it doesn't have that I wish it did was a reversible camera. And of course because it's windows and not Android or Apple, there aren't as many apps. But that's not a big deal for me. At $40, you can't beat the value. I'm thinking about buying another one to keep in the drawer just in case. Again, $40 for a fully operational smartphone.
This cellphone give me 1000 x more then it's cost.<br/>I originally bought it as a GPS only because I love HERE maps - and you can navigate offline with no problem.<br/>But very Quick I realized that this phone has much more.<br/>Perfect size.<br/>Excellent touch screen.<br/>Works very fast and smooth.<br/>Has all possible features.<br/>SD card slot.<br/>YES I AM HAPPY !
The device is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!in addition to the greatness the price.if donkeys could think in comparison to any other cellular ex.iphone they will end paying 10x for a  mediocre device. The 635 is the best option in the USA market.There's not comparison to Lumina gadgets.No matter of the models Jc
Pretty good cheap phone, especially for light use.
Got phone for my daughter(19yr old). She loves it!
Great phone so far, lots of features I'm learning.
impressed. good phone/ low price. easy to navigate.<br/>Cons: tricky to delete phone contacts, you have to call 1st then delete while a call otherwise i didn't find how. so I left 5 stars anyway because ofto price I don't care to lost,  brake or to water this pal because of very low price.  I checked in walmart it cost $98 wow i can afford 7 Nokia for the price of iphone..
The Cell phone is excellent and the price is good
Love this phone, and love the Windows phone software. It is quite easy to use and I was able to get used to it after switching from an iPhone. This is also to replace my Lumia 520.  The 635 is much faster than the 520, so it is a real plus.  The battery drain is slower than that of the 535 too, so that is another plus.  All in all, love this machine and happy with it.
For the price, this phone is fantastic. It is capable of doing most things I do with a phone. Taking notes, sending email, social media, etc. And it does these things well. I love the windows OS<br/><br/>That said, I would much rather have a windows phone flagship. My old phone was the 925, but I was having a tough time replacing it (so I got this in the interim).
Very Good Phone, awesome with windows 8  now with  windows 10 technical preview  awesome performance, very good display only i miss to  hide the  in-screen buttons but after that no problems, very good  LTE and  Unlocked, AND CHEAP  Awesome performance and better than other  ones android devices
I bought the Nokia 635 only because my Razor quit working. I don't need a smart phone but it was in my in my<br/>price range. I didn't like the phones in the lower price tier. I don't like that the battery needs charged every other<br/>day compared to the Razor.  I do like the address book & the frequently called #'s on the phone screen.
For $50, this is a highly capable phone.  I'm currently using it to try out the Windows 10 Preview.  This preview builds on an already solid, if under appreciated, OS.  Ofcourse when you pick up a Windows Phone, you have to put up with spotty 3rd party support for apps.  However, that doesn't de-value the device as much as you might think.
Awesome OS and even better price for a smartphone (compared to iOS or Android offerings).  The Battery lasts about 1.5 days under heavy use for phone, text, data access.  My only wish for this budget smartphone is that it had a flash for taking better indoor pictures, but can't really complain about that when picking it up for <$50.
I just bought this phone. it's a nice size very loud audio!! I just wish Windows would have more apps. now the sig on the unit is lower then my Blu 5.0C in the same place. I have cricket wireless which of course is owned by at&t.; So I did not have to unlock the phone. I just put sim in and away I go. overall for 48.00 you cant go wrong
Decent phone - certainly for the money - no complaints. Primarily picked it up as a GPS and MP3 player but thanks to quick unlocking provided by AT&T; - it also acts as my backup phone and travel phone.<br/><br/>you should be aware the lumia 635 (not just ATT) does not have:<br/>Front facing camera<br/>flash for back facing camera.
I'd highly recommend it, the price is great.
Great phone for the money you can't beat it!
It was a gift for someone and they love it!!
actually bought this to replace my ipod touch.  cost 50.00 opposed to 250 for touch.  Cheaper than Galaxy media player (even if you can find one).<br/>Turned on airplane mode to eliminate phone, even though it is a windows os there are more than enough apps.  Next time you think about buying a touch think about this one for $50.00.
Great phone but will not send MMS pic/text.
Good phone. Works well, sound quality good.
I got this phone within 1 day..I was so thrilled...This is a Great phone this Nokia Lumina 635...<br/>I was really Amazed how good and how easy to use this was..The pictures came out great..and the music has a great sound!!!!!<br/>Thanks to ALL THE GOOD REVIEWS..I read..I went with this phone..And I'm NOT at all Sorry!!!!!
I bought this phone for someone else. The phone itself is nice looking. Sleek design and feel. I owned one before but I'm just not a Windows phone brand person. I do however like the multiple window background look,I have always liked that about Windows phone's. I also do not like AT&T; service but great buy for someone else.
Great love. Beautiful 4.5 inch ClearBlack.
The BEST!!! phone i have ever purchased...
This is an excellent phone. I paid 65.00 for this phone off contract.  For the money, it can not be beat.  Very nice screen, expandable storage with SD card. Ok camera. If you are looking at getting a smartphone for the 1st time, or a backup phone, this will do.  Even I you do not have service, this will work on Wi-Fi.
First smart phone. Still miss old Razor which I had since 2006 ! Only reason I got new phone , port got loose then phone could not hold charge for more than one call. Since 2000 this is my THIRD (3)<br/>phone, other still works but does not accept sim card. Good product ATT, too bad reps at store aren't as good as  product.<br/><br/>to answer question yes you can use your sim card. I my case since it was fron Razor and too large I had to use provided card. but in past the my first to were interchangeable. the company , at least in packageing will tell you that this is so. DO NOT PAY TO HAVE STORE give you another card
Best smartphone you can get for the price. Only two cons.<br/>-screen is a fingerprint magnet. Get the Glazz tempered glass, problem solved.<br/>-a few websites crash on Explorer which I suspect is due to the half gig of RAM. I've since moved on to the Lumia 640 with 1 GB of RAM and haven't experienced this issue.
Pros: Good camera quality, excellent touchscreen sensitivity, Windows OS, good battery backup, compact size, clear volume and mic.  Very pleased with this phone.<br/><br/>Cons: Takes time to come to home screen, if powered down and reboot.<br/><br/>It is good and excellent performance. I would recommend to this.
I just have a couple of questions if someone would kindly answer, First, is the phone unlocked? 2) is the either of these><br/>All Phones must be GSM. 2G 850/1900 or 3G 850/1900. Phones must be SIM Free or Sim Unlocked. I want out of the contract nightmares and go to Naked Mobile.<br/><br/>Thank you so much!
I'm rough on my phones, so I got one of these due the cheap price. I actually like it better then my old expensive android! yes, there a few less apps available, but I found plenty to keep me happy. I put a big memory card in it, and it fast and works great!<br/>  I got this same phone for my 12 yo daughter too.
Phone so far is working good.  I was somewhat skeptical when I read some of the reviews.  Main thing is my fb will just go away while I am on it but that may be something I am doing.  I have been an I phone user for many years and this is totally different.  I just haven't taken the time to read the instructions.
We have two of these using with TalkUSA... we pay about $25 a month for our service. The price of this phone is dropping like the 535 from the previous year (2013)... because MS is coming out with a new one with their branding on it. MS Lumia 640 and 640XL (no more Nokia). This phone will update to 8.1 w\ Cortana
Very awesome phone! Totally recommend it.
love it way better then the i Phone!!!!!!
The phone is just as described, shipped fast in excellent condition when it arrived. Took me a little time to get used to the phone but that is just a user problem nothing to do with the phone! I still haven't got used to all the features yet but my teenaged kids love it and would like to have one just like it.
Phone is actually pretty solid, it's the windows software that's holding it back. I have all 4 major phones and I have to say windows phone 8 is the most outdated, it has the worst lack of apps, there's no true multitasking, and it just looks out dated as well. The only it was really has going for it is camera.
Phone works great,,got this for my 13 yr old grandson,,,(he was on my plan,but his iPhone 5s  got stolen once and lost another time,,even with the insurance it was $175 to replace) this phone is just as good,,and it's CHEAP works great pay $50 a month for everything internet text calls,,,I would recommend 👍🏻
It is a good to go phone for those who lose expensive contracted phones and have a year more to go with contract.  Buy this phone with att or other company that you may have contract have and use it until it is due for another phone.  Price is unbeatable for the features you need to function as a student.
I really enjoy this phone, the Camera is surprisingly good, sometimes my wife takes better pictures than my S5.<br/><br/>The operating system takes a while to get used to coming from andorid or OS, battery life is amazing and the build quality is a 4 star.<br/><br/>The 5 star are due to the low price.
I got this for my niece after her old one was dropped and the case it was in did not protect the phone. I purchased this, called my carrier, set everything up over the phone and all she had to do was take it to the carrier near her college and they set it up for her.  She was done in less than 10 minutes
The phone works. It doesn't have a lot of apps you can install for an Iphone or Android since it's on the Windows platform. Surprisingly, there is no front facing camera so you can't take selfies, which is something my daughters pointed out to me. I would not buy this phone again or recommend to anyone.
I got this phone by mistake when my contract phone broke on a business trip. It is the best mistake I ever made. It surpasses all expectation I had on ANY phone. It's speed, and flawless operation are spectacular. The camera is excellent with many artistic abilities are wonderful. Even without a flash.
Great temporary phone while waiting for new smartphone. I don't know if this could be my everyday phone as I use it to call, text, work email, facebook, etc. The biggest draw is the app store vs. Google Play (or Apple's). Until then, I'd have a hard time using it full-time. Either way, was a lifesaver.
This phone offers many features that the expensive phones have.<br/>The major draw back are app's offered from some of the companies I do business with & the camera that is just so so.<br/>Still it suits my needs just fine.<br/>Has come in handy using the web to find goods and service from my car.<br/>Using AT&T; $40 a month plan
great phone cant beat it for the money!
Exceeded my expectations for the price. It was my first Windows phone, so I had to adjust to the operating system and if you enjoy selfies it does not have a front camera...and that is the only thing I could find wrong. If you purchase this product make sure you buy a case the screen breaks easy.
For $40 you can't go wrong. This phone replaced my damaged 1520 and doesn't compare, but I can email, text, take calls, browse the internet... And pretty much everything else. It doesn't have a camera flash, but for the price I am fine with that. Also worked fine with my regular contract sim...
It's crashed once since I bought it, and I miss having a front facing camera.  Otherwise, for the price, I'm happy.  An update to Windows 8.1 went exactly as advertised.  The only real problem I encountered is that Candy Crush Saga stopped working.  I can chalk that up to an application issue.
The Lumia 636 is one of the first true windows phones running Windows Phone 8.1. It offers an IPS display with 221ppi and vibrante colors.<br/>This phone is a Bargian phone however it is not underpowered. The only negative about this phone is the LACK of a front facing camera.<br/>Comparing this and the older 520 this new 636 phone wipes the floor with it. The load times are 2x as fast if not 3x faster. There seems<br/>to be minimual lag and the wireless rang is excellent. As this is the AT&T; verision it works on any AT&T; network as a prepaid or a regular<br/>contract line, adding this phone to a plan does not extend any contract time.<br/><br/>Out of the gate you will notice this sub $100.00 phone seems smooth and responsive. With the internal space limited to 8GB you will<br/>want to pick up at least a 16GB MicroSD card to load apps and pictures on. If money is tight for you then you have 15GB free Microsoft<br/>One Drive cloud storage space to upload your pictures and documents to. This phone does come preloaded with Microsoft Office (non<br/>touch verision) and Skype. Skype is greeat however the lack of a front cam makes this kind of an unsable feature, as the whole point of Skype is<br/>face to face video chatting. Other wise this phone has a lot to offer in terms of apps and functionality. Microsoft now supports 560,000<br/>apps and is growing daily, yes this is sub par compared to Andorid and iOS in terms of qunaity 1m to 500k however MS has cleaned up<br/>a lot of the apps giving excellent quality to choose from. MS is also buying app makers by the month intergrating those featurs and apps<br/>into Windows Phone. If you have a PC or other Windows devices soon all apps will be universal allowing 1 buy from pc-tablet-phone and other<br/>Windows enabled devices.<br/><br/>Windows 10 tech preivew runs smooth and allows for a lot of the continum featurs lacking from other OS. This new OS truely makes this<br/>phone shine and is well worth the 70 Dollars or less for purchase price.<br/><br/>Spec's are as followed:<br/><br/>Display: 4.5 inch<br/><br/>  Software release: Windows Phone 8.1 with Lumia Cyan<br/>  [Eligable for Windows phone 10 tech preivew]<br/><br/>Size & weight<br/><br/>  Length: 129.5 mm<br/>  Width: 66.7 mm<br/>  Thickness1: 9.2 mm<br/>  Weight: 134 g<br/><br/>Display<br/><br/>  Display size: 4.5 ''<br/>  Display resolution: FWVGA (854 x 480) (HD none 1080) But won't matter on the screen size.<br/>  Display colours: TrueColor (24-bit/16M)<br/>  Pixel density: 221 ppi<br/>  Display features: Corning® Gorilla® Glass 3, Lumia Color profile, Wide viewing angle<br/>  Touch screen technology: Capacitive Multipoint-Touch<br/><br/>Memory<br/><br/>  Internl Storage: 8 GB<br/>  RAM: 512 MB (this is were the phone LACKS compared to other modern phones)<br/>  Expandable memory card: 128 GB<br/>  Free cloud storage: 15 GB One Drive Storgae<br/><br/>Battery<br/><br/>  Replaceable battery: Yes<br/>  Battery capacity: 1830 mAh<br/>  Battery voltage: 3.7 V<br/>  Maximum standby time: 25 days<br/>  Maximum talk time (3G): 13 h<br/>  Maximum music playback time: 58 h<br/>  Maximum Wi-Fi network browsing time: 9.4 h<br/>  Maximum video playback time: 7 h<br/><br/>Keys and Input Methods<br/><br/>  User Input: Touch<br/>  Dedicated hardware key: Volume Keys, Power/Lock key (no camera key)<br/><br/>Sensors<br/><br/>  Sensors: Accelerometer, SensorCore<br/><br/>Processor<br/><br/>  CPU name: Snapdragon™ 400<br/>  Cores and rate: Quad core 1200 MHz per core
This is a review about a no contract phone for Well less than a hundred bucks. I broke my phone and couldn't wait so I got mine from att store but wanted to share my opinion since I usually shop Amazon. The phone is great at what it does 95 percent of time. Every so often an app will close because of the 512 worth of ram but it's not bad or often. I have tons of apps installed and still 3 gigs worth of room. I use several phones that I swap back forth from including Windows and androids depending on what I want to use it for that day, androids to play and Windows for getting down to business. My previous Windows phones are the HTC 8x and lumia 520. Wp8 is really easy to use and very smooth even on a low end phone. For the same 60 bucks on an android and you have an almost unusable phone because of lag and freeze issues. The camera is OK and I don't take selfies so the lack of a front camera doesn't bother me. The screen is really quite amazing for such a cheap phone and coming from the 520 it's a huge step up in colors. The speaker is quite loud along with the ear piece but I do notice a slight robotic hint to the other caller. No complaints from them about the way I sound tho. The screen and phone itself is decent size at 4.5". I really miss the light sensor in the other phones I have, but even with out the proximity sensor it does a good job of turning screen off using its techniques. The only other thing I say is a negative is no flash or led for notifications. But for 60 bucks and it runs better than a 100 dollar android you can't beat it. If you want a solid phone that does all the basics and a lot more at a good price I definitely recommend the 635. Only reason it's not a 5 star is the few minor things it's missing and the fact that it's kind of a bland looking phone. Throw in 1 or the missing items or make it eye catching and I'd give it 5.
This phone is a very good windows phone. The Nokia Lumia 635 is a Windows 8.1 Device. Featuring Cortana, a competitive software competing with Siri. The phone doesn't have a Flash nor Selfie Camera but is a very high class camera, being a Nokia phone. The Headphone Jack is correct, at 3.5mm.
Easy to use for anyone familiar with Windows 8. Clear sound though it does occasionally have difficulty detecting WiFi networks necessitating a restart to identify or access them. It should be noted that the is NO flash so even though a flashlight app is available, this phone can not use it.
The only negative thing I can possibly say about this phone is that the matte plastic backing is a bit slippery, and putting a case on it makes it a bit bulky. I wish there was some texture to it on the back to allow for better grip, but other than that it is an excellent inexpensive phone!
I am in love with this phone!!! I gave up a Galaxy S and I have no regrets. Paired up well with my current AT&T; plan, but I had to get another SIM card cause the Galaxy SIM card was to big. It takes the small size SIM card. It does come with a SIM card for using as a buy the minutes phone.
This phone was bought to replace my wet Iphone. For the money, it is a great deal. It works wonderful, 4G, Wifi, and can do everything I need. It is not an Iphone but for $50 new instead of $600 it is a steal. I will keep it around in a drawer and use it when my one of our phones break.
I've used this phone for several months now and am very pleased with it.  This is my first smartphone, so I can't compare it with<br/>the Iphone or Android, but I'm very comfortable with this Window's phone.  Outdoor pictures are excellent and I have found the phone easy to<br/>use.
Great product. Nokia quality is back!
The the phone is outstanding with no actual complaints about the hardware itself  only issue is limited app support for windows 8/8.1phones there are few (2 I have found by Google) Google supported apps. Not good for people switching from Android. Best for people new to Smartphone's
This phone cost about $20 more than the avail 2, and some other phones. The quality of this is like going from a regular car to a Cadillac.It works so easy,and has far more features,than one would want,and more than you'd expect from a phone at this price.Try it, you might like it!
Great little phone for the price.  I bought these to replace a couple of older phones on my postpaid AT&T; account.  I just stuck my AT&T; sim in and it was ready to go.  Excellent battery life compared to Android, especially when using the Mobile Hotspot feature.  No regrets at all.
This is a great value to upgrade from the Lumina 520. I liked my 520, but after a year, it failed to charge and wasn't worth repairing. I ordered this model (635) and liked the lighter, thinner feel to it, not to mention the upgrade faster processor and the larger brighter screen.
Excellent to use as a non-activated wireless device and MP3 player.  Or to experiment with the Windows mobile platform.  Fully functional with most apps.  Lack of front-facing camera may be off-putting to some, but does not matter much to me.  Well worth the little you will pay.
I love this phone.  It does everything I want it to do. Surf the web, take pictures, play music, and waste time on Facebook.  Recommend this phone to anyone who isn't silly enough to pay $$$ for an expensive phone and the GoPhone rates are great and super cheap!  No contracts!
There may be better phones out there, but for $40 this product is truly incredible. I cannot see how msft could possibly turn a profit on this sale: they must be giving the product away in order to wrest market share away from aapl. As a consumer, its well worth a $40 trial.
I thought it insane to spend hundreds for a phone, so I resisted buying a smartphone. What a great deal!! It is fast and quite intuitive to use. ( I never would have guessed I would recommend a microsoft operating system. $40 - I could not buy too many apples for that price.
I got it very quickly and the packaging was fine enough.<br/>The phone is built well and fast enough to use as a main phone as reviewed in many places.<br/>It is very cheap but more than worth the price.<br/><br/>Very satisfied with the phone as well as amazon's service.
Love this phone! Windows Phone, after all of the getting used to, is pretty cool! The camera is not the best especially because it does not include a flash or front facing camera. The removable back was pretty cool to use and have a removable battery and micro SD card slot.
My wife and I both had Lumia 1020's, unfortunately a friend dropped hers and broke it. I gave her mine and bought this... to this day I still can't comprehend how it only cost me $40. It's obviously not a high end phone, but for the price... it absolutely cannot be beaten.
I bought and have been using this for my unlimited straight talk plan. I was afraid it would be a cheap phone but I have to say that I am very impressed with this phone. Moving from a android to windows takes some getting used to but this was definitely and upgrade for me!
Instead of ordering a new upgrade phone we opted to use this go phone and it turned out to be a good decision. If you are a PC person you will have no problems operating this phone. It syncs up perfectly with our Exchange server and does everything our android phone did.
Excellent cell phone for the price.
A very good Smart phone for beginner.I am a believer in Nokia products.Good signal,good battery life .The only problem I have is the ringing volume is too low.Oh, the phone came well packaged  with new  micro sim,  and charger .( no data cable). Recommend this phone.
Can't beat the price for a smart phone. It may not has as many apps as an android phone, or IOS phone, but its plenty fast and has all the bells and whistles a smart phone needs. Break you on contract phone? grab this to tide you over, you'll b pleasantly surprised.
It's works great so far. It was brand new & reduced to 40$ when I purchased it to replace damaged phone.  I was able to use for current att accnt--NP. Definitely get one if they are still being sold for 40$ & you are an att customer. Peace of mind replacement cell!
This is an amazing deal for a prepaid smartphone.  Fast, fluid, clear crisp display. Literally could buy almost 4 of these for the cost of an iPhone on contract ($199.99 iPhone 6 16gb). Very satisfied with ATT service and the cost of the monthly (no contract) rate!
It doesn't do a lot of things that I was used to with my iphone and the camera is horrible, BUT it's waaaay above and beyond what I would expect for a smartphone that I spent less than $50 on.  I'll definitely be able to live with it until I'm due for an upgrade.
It has a pedometer which is awesome, my previous 925 and 920 didn't have that option. However this phone doesn't have a camera button or a compass. Everything else though is fine I don't see any reason in spending the money on a premium phone outside of the 1520.
Came in clam shell retail package transfered my att sim card into it and kept on trucking. Not do for upgrade for 6 months and my HTC one is junk after HTC stopped supporting. It. So 40 dollar phone and a micro SD card and pop in the existing sim from old phone.
Wow I really love this phone! I'm new to smart phones but this seems easy to use because I'm used to computers. I'm 58 and don't like messing with phones, but I must say this was much easier than I ever thought. It seems to be a very good phone, hope this helps.
I bought the phone for my granddaughter and she loves it. The Google phone fits her style of life and it is very rarely out of her hand. I would recommend it for someone who knows how to use all the phones features, other then that, it would be a waste of money.
Not a bad phone would be nicer if it had a light. But its really not bad when you really needed something fast. I am gonna wait for a better deal before I get another type of phone cus this one is really not a bad as some tell you on here. I would buy again.
Sometimes the internet will kick you off, but other than that, no complaints. Although I will state I still don't know what half of the icons on the main screen are or what they do. Would probably help if I read the manual, but where's the mystery in that?
Excellent phone i received.  I have been using Iphone 4, 5 and Galaxy III for a while.  But very impressed with this windows phone.<br/>I bought it for my mother who liked it very much.  No front camera, so skype video calls would not be possible though.
MASSIVE pain in the neck to get working. I received two of these yesterday. I spent six hours talking to Nokia, ATandT, and Time Warner to get them working..... now we wait to see if indeed they will work..... so far the kids are texting quit a lot.....
So far so good. Still learning the  many  features it contains. No dropped calls, wi fi  works well., sound clear  able to enlarge font and simplify its use to my liking. Will return once I have mastered its use, yes it does work with consumer cellular
An excellent phone for the price. It is a very basic phone. Windows 8.1 does not have support for many popular apps so that is something to consider before purchasing. Otherwise, it has been very reliable for me thus far and have no complaints at all.
just now I have upgraded to a smart phone if thats the proper term, but I like it more than I thought I would even though its a little more cumbersome to carry than my old phone the usefulness and entertainment it provides more than makes up for it.
I am a Windows guy, I love the syncing with my computers and all the common apps that cross platforms (PC - Phone). This is why I went to a smartphone cause the ease of using and getting to know it fast. WILL NEVER BE a i phone or android guy, YES!
Battery failed after four months
Admittedly I never actually used this phone in the real world but I was very impressed at the overall build quality, durability, screen and basic task performance. Were I in the market for a cheap replacement phone this would definitely be the one
The phone came in an AT&T; GoPhone box. I wanted to switch the sim card from my old phone into the Nokia, but because my old sim card was larger, I used the one that came in the package with the Nokia. All I had to do was call AT&T; to get my phone number transferred to the new sim card -- it only took a few minutes.<br/><br/>The battery life for this smartphone is pretty good -- actually went without recharging for 3 days, and then the battery was 70 percent before re-charge.Just used it for talking and texting and email, so that may explain longevity, as well as setting the battery usage so that nonessential functions and notifications were diminished. Some apps and using the internet will drain faster, but still pretty good.<br/><br/>Not as many apps as IOS and Android, but enough to keep me going. Some apps I do miss, but I use my computer or tablet if I really need to get something done.<br/><br/>Love the wifi on the phone. Camera, not the best but good. Phone quality so far is pretty good. FM radio is okay.<br/><br/>This is my second Nokia phone. The first one was a flip phone that I had with T-Mobile, and would still be using it except new T-Mobile sim cards no longer worked with it after 5 years. I still have it 10 years later and it still has the original battery and works (radio, calendar, alarms), except without a carrier. So, if this is like my first Nokia, it should last and be easy on battery life.
Better than my iphone.... iphone battery died exactly at one year... now, a better phone<br/>for $50 !!! love my nokia and windows phone OS is so nice and friendly... maybe I will<br/>drop my ipad and get myself a Surface... fed up with apple.
Great starter phone for younger users! My son is happy with it (10 years old and can easily navigate through the phone). Word to the wise- if you are using this with AT&T; be ready to set aside an hour for setup and another phone line to do so.
Is actually a great value. Pros: Big one is you get Windows system. Compstible with Internet Explorer and other Windows programs like Word and Outlook. Cons: Poor screen and camera. Other then that not a bad choice if you are a Windows fan.
This is a great phone. This is a great phone with cheap plans on the best phone service AT&T.; The GPS is very good.<br/>Cons. The app store isnt very good and it dosent have many popular apps with all the same features. ( Instagram & Vine)
for the money, best phone ever.
Bought this as a replacement for my son's phone. Went to AT&T; and had a new Sim card put in. It has worked well for my son. He uses WiFi and has had no complaints. Kept the GoPhone Sim card just in case we want to switch to a GoPhone plan.
For a Windows phone it is cheap and works well, much more useful than other no contract phones out there for the price. Affordable, and I now want a real powerful Nokia with a contract... But I'll never forget this great phone. I love it!
It's a great phone for the price I just wish it had more ram because I find that while using the phone sometimes it will spaz out and I have to restart it then it takes 20 min for the phone to fully come back when you have a micro SD card
On paper, this is a good phone for the price. However, the first one of these I purchased had to be replaced because Cortana refused to work, despite resetting the phone twice. I searched extensively online for solutions, but none of the recommendations worked. I decided to return the phone and opted for a replacement.<br/><br/>The second phone was pretty buggy. The news app crashed the phone about 20% of the time I watched videos. The screen periodically flickered and went blank. Tapping the power button did nothing; I had to do a hard restart of the phone to get the display working again. Plugging in headphones made the volume settings jump all over the place; the phone thought I was holding down the volume button, and every time I turned the volume up, the phone turned it right back down. I decided to return the phone for good.<br/><br/>My wife has one of these and it seems to be working pretty well for her; she isn't having any of these issues. Based on the other reviews for the phone, I am guessing that I am just unlucky.
had this phone for quite a while then dropped it.  Glass shattered.  Like it enough to replace it with the same version.  inexpensive but works as well as the more expensive phones.  Does not have a flash for pictures but minor issue.
Love this phone. Replace the iphone 4 with this Nokia. Simple to use. Can expand memory with a micro sd card. Small glitches every now and then but well worth $40. Vs the $300 the iphone runs. Also links up with my windows 8 computer.
Very good backup phone. All the basics of a smartphone for $40. Good for first time phone users too like your highschool kids. Setup was easy. Just called AT&T; and activated the sim card for our existing line and it worked flawlessly.
Great basic smartphone. Sure it doesn't have as many features as the latest and greatest iPhone or galaxy but it is literally 10% the cost. This is great for folks who don't use their phones all that much but still want a smartphone.
This phone is great. Love it. Takes great pictures. Our son has an expensive phone and mine takes better pictures with true color compared to his.<br/>Not hard to use and if you want a good phone at a reasonable price, this is it.
Great value in a Windows Smart Phone!! The offline HERE Maps (including HERE Drive and HERE Transit) are fantastic and by themselves make the phone worth buying. Windows Phone is easy to use and works smoothly. Highly recommended!!
Nice phone with a lot of options. I wish it came unlocked but was able to get the code online and unlock it. Some of the preloaded ATT stuff is no longer useful since I'm using it with another carrier but all in all a decent phone.
The phone is decent for the amount of money spent. The phone is light weight. The camera takes decent pictures and I think its great that the phone has windows 8 which was important for the person that the phone was purchased for.
Speakerphone is excellent as far as volume.  Also, it's basically easy to operate, light, and not too sensitive to the touch.  I  did have to print out the numerous directions in order to operate it and it does take some studying.
I bought this phone to get acquainted with Windows Phone 8.1 OS.  This phone will be upgraded to Windows 10 later this year.  For the price you get full Nokia quality.  Excellent call quality, good battery life and simple to use.
It's missing some key features, like a front-facing camera, high resolution screen and flash for the rear camera (which is lackluster at best), but for $30-$50 bucks for a reasonably speedy smart phone, how can you even complain?
Fast delivery 2 days even with the 7 day option chosen. This really is a fine phone and for the price its a deal. Window 8.1 operating system was intimidating but after about 3 hour of familiarizing my self with its seems great.
This phone was super cheap and works like an expensive phone. I have never tried a windows phone before but this works great. I would definitely recommend to anyone...especially if you are replacing a phone and need one quick.
Phone is great and easy to use. So far, I have only used calling and messaging as I don't want to pay for expensive service charges--just the minimal GoPhone service. Sound quality and reception in a remote area are very good.
By far the best phone for the price, very fast and easy to use. Bought one for my daughter also. No need to go out and pay $500 dollars for a phone when this will do just as well. Very impressed with the quality of this phone.
I love my Lumia 635 Windows phone.  Very fast and smooth.  The black color back is a bit dull but I bought different color shells offered by Nokia.  The shells work great with the phone and give the phone quite a vibrant look.
Great price & quick delivery!
Excellent phone. It is really fast and smooth, gorilla glass protection, the camera resolution is ok, since it is 5mp without flash, however, it takes advantage of the light, great 720p video recorder. Great battery life.
Love it! Works really well, only problem is I have to change my data plan in order to use the apps (that require internet access). Other than that I love this phone and it came two days before it's first expected date! 😄
A great budget phone for an AT&T; user. However, the phone begins to give up too easily if you tax it with apps and large memory programs. Plus, the windows App Store is the worst so consider android before this.
To be honest, I didn't expect its performance due to both its cheap price and AP of the old type(snapdragon 400 processor).<br/>However, it operates very well without making troubles such as freezing and so on.
For the money  it's GREAT !
its getting me by ive had it for a few months definitely a huge downgrade, apps suck, web browser sucks(always crashing)<br/>idk i wouldn't recommend this to anyone except a young teen.<br/>long live android!
Took some getting used to after using a flip-phone for years but it works fine and it works with Consumer Cellular just swapping the SIM card from the flip-phone and I was up and running on Consumer Cellular.
this is a good phone for calls and for texts, butt the app store is completely empty, I need a phone for mp3 playing too and this media player on this phone really sucks. its good for kids, but not for adults
So far I am loving my phone.It is perfect for me and suits my needs perfectly.I just need to find an anti glare screen because out in the sun I can't read the screen but other than that it's a great phone!!!
I have a plan with Consumer Cellular and bought this phone to use on it. Pop in the SIM card, calls & texts will work. Go into the settings and enable data and picture messaging - it works for me perfectly.
I liked the phone at first but I haven't even had this phone a month and the charger port has already went out in it. Very disappointed in this product.
For it's cost, this is one amazing phone.  Having fun with it although the keyboard is a bit small.  Can't text with thumbs... have to use my pinkie finger but then again, the phone is a gem at this price.
Couldn't have asked for more. Even more-so for a $46.20. It's fast, responsive, has the apps I need, and has great build quality. Indefinably a worthy upgrade from my 520. Very satisfied.
A nice affordable 4g phone. My only issue is son aps aren't available because it's a window phone. It also doesn't have the from camera for selfies, other than that it's worth the price.
Nice phone for the price. I got it on a pre paid plan. My only complaint is people sound like they are in the bathroom when you talk to them. Other than that, a good phone for the price.
I do love it! My first "smart phone". I cut my teeth so to speak on Windows so it's very familiar, easy to navigate and was simple to replace my old non-smart handset with this.
This is the perfect smartphone, cheaper, pretty , good brand, I buyed this cellphone for my mother and father, they are very happy now. I am owner that iPhone 5s and now I want a Lumia!
The phone is easy to use. The pictures taken with the phone are impressive. My only wish it had a flash. Any one still using a laptop with windows will have no problem using this phone.
Great phone definitely a step up from my 520. The 635 has a larger screen and the battery life is great much better the the 520. This is a great smartphone for the money a real value.
Thought I'd never see my wife be happy with any phone that didn't have a physical keyboard, but she is in love with this 635.  Messaging is super easy with the voice to text feature.
Very impressed with it! Works like a champ! So glad I upgraded to it! Phone runs smooth. A couple programs seem to just auto close. Like Health and Fitness! Cortana is fun to use! :)
Last year, Nokia released the Nokia 520 and it became the best-selling Windows Phone of all time. Not only was it a great deal in terms of pricing, but it was also a great phone. So what could they do for a follow-up to their best seller? They released the Nokia 635, which improves upon several aspects of the 520.<br/><br/>That is what we have here in this review. First, let's discuss what a GoPhone is and what you can do with it.<br/><br/>There are two ways you can use a GoPhone. A GoPhone can be used with its included SIM card or with your existing SIM card. If you want to use it with the included card, you'll need to follow the activation process with AT&T.; The other option is to use an AT&T; SIM card you already have. If you need a backup phone, or broke your phone, and already have an activated AT&T; SIM card, you can pick up one of these and pop your SIM card in it. You do not need to do anything with the included SIM card if you use your existing SIM. In fact, there is a sticker on the back of... Read more
This is my first smart phone. At first look, I was disappointed at the filmy materials of this phone. But at this price, what can you complain and I think it is a good buy now.
Purchased one for myself earlier. Decided to buy this for my wife also. For $40 you can't beat it. Easy to use. Might not be an I phone 6, but for the price you can't go wrong.
'The phone is wonderful, but I don't get a USB cable with it while on the box it says there's supposed to be one. I can't connect my phone to my computer without the USB cable.
A great value for this phone. The battery averages about two days then needs to be charged. This phone has the best battery life out of all the smartphones that I have tried.
Great phone for the money! I needed a phone that would blend seamlessly into Microsoft's product ecosystem, and it did the job flawlessly. Excellent quality for a low price.
Well worth the money..
Phone is awesome. I had to return only because something wrong with SIM card reader. I only recommend for those that use Microsoft and want to be able to synch all devices.
Learning something new about the phone every day. I also have Windows 8.1 on my laptop so this is why I got it on my phone.
I bought this phone to use with tmobile, it was the best price I could find online. I called ATT and they unlocked it with no issues and it works great on tmobiles network
We have three of  Lumia 635 and they are fantastic. It just takes some getting use to Windows, over all the phone is outstanding, I cannot find anything negative about it.
My new phone arriced as advertised and I am using it regularly.  I recommend getting the protective case as they are not readily available in stores for this phone.
Met all my expectations..wonderful for taking the occasional pay per minute call and accessing the web via wifi..screen is exceptional..only con is the limited apps
This Winphone kicks all the ass. U don't need a hyper-priced Galaxy to do your thing.<br/>Get a Winphone. This thing is portable, smart, and cute!  5 star all day!
Works great so far.  The only thing I did not like is that there is no light or flash for the camera.  So you can only take pictures in daylight or good lighting.
I strictly use it as a phone and maybe some pictures.  However, at home I can use my internet connection to use the other apps available.  It is perfect for me.
Pretty good phone but doesn't work well with solitare game.  It crashes.<br/>My previous phone was an older version of the Lumia and it handled the games well.
Nokia Here Map is awesome, I use this phone as a GPS device, only complaint is lack of apps. But for 30 bucks, and Nokia brand as a trophy, I can bear with it.
If you can stomach more Microsoft mediocrity with OS, this device is a great deal for the money. Don’t be put off, it does not need to be used as a “GoPhone”.
A good starter phone and it exceeded my expectations.  This was my first Windows phone and it took some getting use to, but once I got he hang of it I'm good.
$50 for a phone is a steal. And if you already have one it could make a great gift. And even if you do not activate it you can use it as a small media device.
Touch screen stopped working within 4 months despite never being dropped or mishandled during that time.
This phone would be a great value at twice the price. My favorite features beside price are the navigation software with downloadable maps, the way social media is integrated in the contacts on Windows Phone, and the ability to add a Micro SD card. Compromises are the camera is not as good as my iPhone was, but it's close. The screen is a finger print magnet, but I ordered a shield. If you don't need LTE, the Nokia 520 is also an incredible value (I purchased one for my daughter). Hats off to Nokia for releasing great smart phones that you don't need to go into debt for.
I bought this to use simply as a wifi device.  It works fine for that purpose.  I don't know that I would want this to be my primary mobile device.
This AT&T; Nokia Lumia 635 No Contract smartphone I bought recently from Amazon is the one shown in the description and works fine.  No problems. :)
Windows phone suits me just fine, it's fast, stable and best of all it's easy to use. And the quality of Nokia is as good or better than any other.
The delivery is very Fast.<br/>And this is a really nice budget phone.<br/>Better than my expectation I have to say<br/>This is a cheerful deal.
This phone is wonderful I am so happy with all the features. The only thing I'm disappointed in is the camera it  doesn't have a front facing lens.
It is very good , regardless of the interface and operation are great, I like it very much, if you like it , might as well try。It is really good ！
Absolutely the nicest phone I have ever owned. I love the live tiles -- how they automatically update with the latest info. This one is a keeper.
Phone is great and built pretty well. The only real issue is the poor app support. Windows could do better. Their phones deserve better support.
I got this for my husband after I got myself one, and he loves it. And if you have wifi there's no need to get a tablet, this phone does both.
Bought two within a week. Had puchased 2 previously..would buy again..easy to use and work like the more expensive ones..great buy for price.
Got this for my grandsons birthday  he loved it all the features was just what he wanted so if you have a teenager this is the phone for them
That is just what I need. Great for beginners, or professional alike. Easy to usecomes with instructions. I will recommend it to my friends.
You really can't beat this phone for the value..  Works great.  Add a 32 GB Micro SD card and you have lots of capabilities with this phone.
Great phone for the price.<br/>microsoft still has a lot of catching up on the compatability side with apps available to apple and android.
A great phone, especially for the price. I live in an area where it is hard to get cell phone service. This phone has given me no problems.
The navigation was not the greatest and the screen cracked while using the touch screen. I am not sure if the one we received was defective
Good phone.it has all features and apps I need. Why spent $600 for hyped phones. The great feature is you can add memory for less money.
Great smartphone!
love it now win10
Wonderful phone, I think next month I will replace my old one Nokia. Now is used in Europe by my daughter. The price is also very good.
It is a very good phone and a terrific price (49.00 including shipping), it's fast, lightweight and easy to use, I recommend it highly.
Great econo phone with all the features I need.  I would recommend this phone for any family that is considering phones for their kids.
I purchased this phone several weeks ago and aside from a couple of issues using the Lumia Camera app it has been a very good purchase.
Takes some time to get use Windows format...has some nice features...phone works well...still have my Android phone...for back-up...
Grandson liked the phone but it did not let him transfer his contact numbers. He had to go to the store and they could do it either.
I love this phone!  It is my first smartphone, and I'm never going back.  This is very easy to use, and the calendar is a lifesaver!
Only cons is that the phone itself is very slippery and the windows button is very sensitive and too easy to hit when playing games.
Not a top of the line phone but it has lasted a very long time without breaking.  I wish I could have said the same about the 1020.
Son loves it. Cortana is a plus. He claims she's better than Siri. He's had it a few months now and so far no problems with it.
Excellent phone. Phone showed up a day early and all was as expected. Installed SIM card and was up and running in 5 minutes...
The phone was to small for me.and the carrie microsoft want to much in formation.and to read all your emails.l like to be pvt.
Not a bad phone for the money. Running Win 10 with no problems. Got the phone for my daughter and she says she like the phone.
it is really what I needed I am retired and works very well for my means of communication. I highly recommend it for the price
For the price, it is great phone. I own a i-phone now, I don't get to use all the features. This phone has everything I need.
The hardware for this phone seems decent. It is fast enough to use ok. I got 3 of them. One for my wife and each of my twins. The hardware I would give a 3-4 star rating. The version of Windows and the flood of bloat ware on this made me feel it would be worth the satisfaction of chucking the phone against the wall, despite just purchasing it. When you first start the phone and put in your old SIM card it seems to work fine. Once it is set up, prepare to wait for a very long time while it updates and installes every piece of un-needed bloat ware known to mankind. Want to import your contacts from your old phone, you can do that, but the app YOU want to download has to wait until 45 other apps you DONT want download. Finding the downloads and stopping them ins needlessly complicated. Don't already have a MS account? Don't even bother trying to use the phone to sign up. There is a CAPTCHA screen you have to go through. Problem is the picture is SO SMALL only Ant Man can read it. Resize the picture and good luck actually being able to see what you are typing. Just make an account on your PC. If you have any concern whatsoever about your privacy pretty much every free bloat ware app on here wants access to your entire digital life. The ONLY thing this bloat fest crappy Windows version that is better than signing up for iOS is that you don't need a credit card to download a free app. (I hate iOS too just because of the hoops you have to jump through to get the device into a state someone can use it). Between this 'wonderful user expereince' with Winblows, and prior frustrations with Apple BS, I'm only buying Android devices in the future. Too bad, this phone is just a Windows edition. Android would be so much less frustration setting up. I hardly ever do reviews but this software ticket me off so much I had to vent. Get an Android device and save yourself my headache. Now I'm off to see if I can get same day delivery of extra stregnth Excedrine.....
Very nice phone. Does what I need it too.<br/><br/>Kind of silly to have Skype on it when there is no front facing camera.
Works great.  Downloads from AT&T; faster than my much more expensive LG G2.  Only problem is that it doesn't have many apps.
Bought it for my husband. He seems to like it just fine so far. We've only had it for a couple days. So only time will tell.
This phone is fun! I totally love Windows 8.1 and would never ever go back to android or IOS!!! This is a great bargain!
Bought for 73 year old mother. her first smart phone. She really likes it , easy to use. She doesn't need all the apps.
My only problem is that the batterey looses charge quickly.<br/>But I am having fun learning all the things it can do.
If you have a budget, like me, then you may find that this phone does all you need. And it has 4,5 inch, enough for me.
One of the better phones on the market.  Windows phones are great, too bad the rest of the world is in love with Apple.
MS app store lacks a few great apps compared to G Play and Apple.... Not Nokia's fault but need to be aware of that..
It is a good phone, with good reception and works well. However, it heats (becomes warm) after a few minutes of use.
I just received my new AT&T; Nokia Lumia 635 go phone and I love it .  The price was great and time of delivery also.
The best windows phone which costs 29 USD only. Emailed the At&t; and got the unlock code within a few hours. Superb!
Definitely my phone of choice. Haven't regretted switching from iPhone once. Great quality at an outstanding price.
this is an amazing phone at an amazing price. Light, durable, WP8.1 capable.<br/>No doubt an amazing purchase
Works great!  Like the OS...  Just wish the MS app store had more apps!<br/>Not a great camera, but usable...
good phone so far good camera i can can talk outside on it and it doesn't drop the network works pretty good.
Works very well. Camera takes beautiful photos. The Windows OS is more difficult to use than some other OS's.
Very good phone. battery lasts long, just enough Apps from MS store. However, sometimes you can feel the lag.
So far non complaints. Great phone for the price. Camera not that great but for tr price of the phone it's ok
Love it!  Easy to use, form factor is perfect for me, and there are plenty of excellent apps for this phone.
Nice smartphone for the price. This phone is perfect for my kid. Very in expensive and has lots of features.
Same day delivery! Awesomeness totally happy 😊 great price new in package all good so far..h hh h j h j j j
A nice basic phone.  I am a tech idiot and it was pretty easy to use.  Instructions could have been better.
What a Real Value this is! Solid 4G/Bluetooth Performance with outstanding Battery Life!<br/>Thanks Nokia!
For its price it's a great phone. It's fast with the latest windows 8.1 OS. Don't forget to buy an SD card.
At first, I was very pleased with this phone, but after owning it a few months it became unstable.  It finally went into a continuous reboot loop.  Tech support was very difficult to deal with due to their language barrier.  It took several days to get a shipping label to return it.  I have gone through that process twice to return it.  Both times it came back with the same issue.
It's ok but wont let me post on friends timeline or play certain games and drop calls and alot of problems
I just bought this phone-LOVE IT--GREAT PIC- TAKING -TAKES GREAT VIDEOS-CANNOT SAY ANYTHInG BAD ABOUT IT!!
phone is good, but the Micro-USB Sync Cable is missing. It's not in the package. There is only a charger.
The shipping was very fast and I got exactly what I wanted at reasonable price. Thanks Amazon, great job!
Perfect replacement for the phone that our kids lost. Cheaper than the local stores and easily activated.
Just too good
it work great
A clear screen. Very well priced. Limited app store, but it is worth the price. Nice emoticon selection.
Suitable for kids to use.<br/>It is lightweight and basic well.<br/>Market is bad thats disadvantages.
I am just in love with my phone!! has many cool features and gives me just what I need in a smart phone.
Great cheap little phone. Easy to unlock and great entry so does phone. Use as a backup and music player
Great phone for $50. No issue so far. downside not that many apps but that is fine it has all major apps
Solid phone for the price. For 60 bucks it does everything I want it to. The Nokia maps app is awesome.
This is quite good basic windows phone. If you wanna be a newbie of windows phone, this is good choice.
solid built product. Everything works fine. The only problem is too few app available for windows phone
Pretty good phone for the price, offers the greatness of Windows phone at a sweet Price. Can't beat it.
I really wanted to like this phone.  It's a good size and it looks great.  It never worked right for me.  I could not send or receive pictures or groups texts.  At first I thought it was me, but but after several trips to the ATT store and several hours on tech support, I discovered it's a known issue with the phone.  Nokia is aware of the issue with this model.  My phone is defective.  I can't find a way to contact the seller for an exchange and it's taken so long to resolve the problem, I can't return it through Amazon.  So a big waste of money.
works well.  easy to sync with my tablet and laptop.  Battery charge life for me is better than 3 days
I wish windows had more apps but it is definitely a GREAT phone for the price!  No complaints from me.
The screen quality is better than model 520. Could be nice if it has a rear camera and back LED light.
Good for the money. Does what ask smart phones do. Sometimes apps crash when they use alot of memory.
A back up phone for a 12 year old until he is ready for a real upgrade. Does everything I need it to.
Works as expected.  3 in my family now have this particular phone and it fills our needs really well.
Works well in the past month.  Had to reset everything one time, but does the job for my teenage son.
This device is fairly decent. Although I got carrier unlock refused from AT&T;, I'll like this device. It has low memory, low screen resolution but for under $50 device, it is not so bad. Now I'm gonna make an AT&T; prepaid contract.
Phone works good .I like the windows phone . Battery life is poor.Not even getting 24 hrs life on it
Nice backup phone, works on Cricket as well. Last of the REAL Nokia's, get one before it's too late.
Amazing, phone works well. It was cheap and i would suggest a friend to purchase this product.
This is a great smartphone that fits the bill and Win 8.1 has all the features one could want.
Shipped on time. Daughter is pleased, I do recommend adding memory storage. But it works good.
Fantastic phone on so many levels, Nokia took the already amazing nokia lumia 520 and made it even better. The 635's battery life bundled with LTE, a quad core snapdragon 400 and a decent screen size makes it a great phone. The only bad thing I have to say about this phone is that after a couple of weeks of use the back shell of the phone started to get creaky and feel a little flimsy (my friend had the same problem) but it's just a minor complaint that was easily fixed by a piece of duct tape.
It plays solitaire, you can download apps, take pictures, play music..........and make calls.
A great product compared to the low price.<br/>Thanks I have the experience of WindowsPhone.
wow, for 40$, really great deal . It is not an iphone or samsung but I spent 40$ ...come one
First introduction to Windows for Phone was a revelation.  Fully functional and fun to use.
My daughter is very happy with this phone. It works great and it's very nice for the price!
Getting to work it.  Not a computer person so having some problems.  Shpil;d be all right.
For the most part it works great. Every once in awhile it freezes up or apps wont connect.
Great phone for a great price. Only wish it was dual facing camera instead of rear facing.
Great phone
Good price for what you get.  Using it as a replacement smartphone until time to upgrade.
My daughter got this as a replacement for her Lumia 520...she's been very happy with it.
Nice second ph for work.... n thanks to AT & T guys... unlock the ph for free.... 😂😂😂
I absolutely love this phone I'm a vivid android user but this windows phone is perfect!
I love this phone.  It does everything and is very east to use.  No problems whatsoever
Used as a spare and almost did not pick up broken 1520 but screen too small for my use.
takes sd card upto 128 GB, nice touch screen but battery @ 1800 mah is quite not enough
smart phone usability is bad. but phone spec is good<br/>the problem is windows phone.
Apparently this phone will be upgradeable to windows 10<br/>Great bargain, great phone
Nice looking inexpensive phone.  Looks  even better if you change the back shell from black to white.  Windows operating system is very simple to learn.  Screen says 4.5 inches but it is less due to icons that run along the bottom. They are not outside the screen.  Maybe there is a way to change that, but haven't found it yet. I want this phone with a front camera, a flash, a  higher quality rear camera, and a 5 inch screen. Recommended product.
Everything I expected and more.<br/>Put in my existing SIM card and works perfectly!
A lot of bang for the bucks. Many apps. Does everything I want and more. Good signal.
Good price for a phone with plenty of features.<br/><br/>Decent MP3 player as well.
I was very surprised how easy it was to transfer everything over from my other phone.
Good size phone. Missing front facing camera (that could be important for some users)
Cheap and useful Windows phone. I will be able to update to Windows 10 when released
Hard to hear speaker phone, ring tone and videos.  Otherwise a great phone for cost.
got this phone for my mum; very easy to use and the shape is great! <3 <3
Love this phone ! Highly recommend ! Has everything I need and at a great price!!
Not the best for searching the web, but decent for what it is and for the price.
Wonderful phone for my mom. Easy and smooth for her to use. Unbelievably $29.99!
Great phone. It does everything that you need. It is equal to any android phone.
Great phone.  I am really impressed with it.  It runs circles around my android.
it is a good phone but after a while’s use, it hangs. I really got bored by it.
Wow super fast amazon delivery . Phone easy to setup and well worth the upgrade
good phone not the best quality(almost like a toy) but it does its job and more
My son loves his phone first phone.  Cheap price, no contract.  Win win for me.
can't beat this phone for the price point.... great web performance on wifi!!!
Good phone.  The only short coming is that it needs to be recharged every day.
Item was as described, received earlier than expected and it is working great!
Currently have Windows 10 Mobile on it. Great little phone, with a huge heart!
broke my att phone  got the go phone it works great and cheaper then insurance
My wife had a older verision of window phone and she is enjoying it very much.
I purchased a Lumia 635 2 weeks ago. However, I noticed today that its screen often rotates automatically even if the phone is not turned.<br/>when you look at a web page, it constantly rotates. you cannot focus on the contents. it is very upsetting.<br/>other functions seem working ok.<br/>Could anybody have an insight into this and help with some ideas to solve this?<br/>Thanks<br/><br/>Kevin
awsome phone, gps works great!! for the price, you cant ask for better phone!
Didn't find it to be the easiest phone to figure out. But would recommend it.
Great phone!! Does everything I want and more, I highly recommend this phone!
The best phone on the low end of the market. Does everything you need to do.
I love it. ...went from an LG Optimus 7 which I loved to this one.....great!
great phone for my needs...love Windows and wont go back to android or apple
Great phone for my 12 yr old grandson. He uses his iPod for portable gaming
Great phone easy to navigate only problem I had was it had no front camera.
The screen is vibrant. Good phone for anyone into windows operating system.
i went from one phone to this one and i'm so glad i did,it's awesome thanks
so nice phone!<br/>i can unlock this phone via AT&T;<br/>Thank you amazon!
I'm very satisfied with this phone it is the up most phone that I ever had
very good call and sound quality, easy to use. but ran of apps is critical

It's a really nice phone. And thanks to Amazon prime I had it in two days.
Phone works very well. Satisfied, this low cost phone very impressed with.
Excellent
EXCELENTE
It  took a little bit to get used to the windows based app, but I like it
A great cell phone for the price. It has all that I need in a cell phone.
Phone has greatly exceeded my expectations.  Can't beat it for the price.
An incredible product. The unconditional recommendation. Good! Disappear.
This is awesome product...works great and I really enjoy it. Recommended!
Been very satisfy with this purchase , no problems at all with the phone.
It was as shown, it's a great deal, a great phone for your money. love it
The Nokia Lumia 635 is a simple to use phone that fits my needs perfectly
I bought this since I was happy with my old Lumia 520.  I have been tons of problems with this phone though.  The screen goes blank and cant be awakened and when it happens I cant talk to my callers (but the call isnt dropped). Very frustrating. I ended up ordering the older model (Lumia 520) which I had good luck with in the past but I'm having the same issue with that model.
I prefer to have a windows phone and purchased this one as an upgrade to my Lumia 520. I have Cricket Wireless as my carrier and after fully charging the phone I took the sim card out of my 520 and put it into this phone and it works great. The main reason for the upgrade was that this phone has Cortana which I am still playing with but so far it works great. Highly recommend.
Great phone! I switched from android and I don't think I'm going back :)
It is quite different for me with a touch screen, but I really like it.
For the price and 4G LTE, it's well worth putting up with Windows 8.1.
Purchased for my teenage granddaughters.  They are very happy with it!
Works great with PureTalkUSA, but had to cut the SIM card down to fit.
Item was in nee condition, and works as well as I thought it would.
Great phone.would definitely recommend this Windows phone to anyone
Can't say much on this phone bcos I returned it and go for the Sony
Terrific price for a wonderful gadget! Super fast shipping as well!
Nice smart phone for the price and takes mirco SD card up to 128 GB
My husband just needed a simple smart phone. Nothing fancy. Perfect
Fast delivery and a great Windows phone. Try one, you will like it!
I bought the phone from Microsoft store at thanksgiving promotion. I had been using it since then. My wife had Lumia 520 for a while and she was fine with it until she started using android phone and found windows phone is so inconvenient to use.<br/>The phone runs under Windows Phone 8.1. This is an AT&T; no contract phone, however you can plug in AT&T; contract phone's sim card and use with the existing number.<br/><br/>The good: A cheap but good quality and relative good feature phone, comes with a few Nokia/Microsoft develop Apps that are very nice to use. For example the Nokia Here suites(GPS, maps, buses, and Commute routes) and Lumia App suites. Maps allow you download US maps in different states and use offline. You may turn the phone as a WIFI hotspot when data is ON. With Multi-language supports. If you use Microsoft OneDrive, you can backup contacts and files among Windows Phones and Android /iphones.<br/><br/>The bad: It is a Windows phone! None of the feature apps are convenient or sensible to use. The Music will not play one after another, it is hard to add a play list. So is the video. Adding contact isn't straight forward under the phone icon, .... just so many to complain. And Windows Apps are not as many as Android and iPhone. Even it has, some Apps are not as nice as their Android iphone versions. And no front camera!<br/><br/>The ugly:  Can't even easily connect to a Windows computer! Windows 7/8 computer would not recognize it, and no driver would work. The Windows Phone APP for Windows does not recognize it! I searched and found many have such issues. By now, I can't have any of my computer recognize it to transfer pictures and files. So you rely on email attachment or take off the SD card  for file transmission between phone and computer. Come on Microsoft! is the Windows phone not your Windows?
I wanted to love this phone.  I really did.  What an amazing price!  Good, clear picture; easy to use, responsive touchscreen.  But the Wi-Fi...well, it's awful.  To start, right out of the box, I had trouble.  It kept saying "incorrect password" when I knew damn well that the password was right.  I turned the phone off and on, soft reset, hard reset, nothing worked.  Finally I rebooted my router (which made no sense to me because every other device I had was working fine with my router) and magically it worked!  "All right, we're in business", I thought.  Hell no we're not.  Now the password works, and it connects to my router; but every time I lock my phone screen it loses connection to the internet and I have to delete the network and add it back and input the Wi-Fi password again, and guess what?!  IT SAYS "INCORRECT PASSWORD". I know it sounds like a problem with my router, but my router is only a week old and works gloriously well with all of my family's tablets, game consoles, and other cell phones.  I'm going to see if I can find out about any settings that I can change in my router, but I've had no luck so far.  Had I known the headache this would be, I would never have bought this phone.  Oh, and good luck finding any answers on the "help" threads.  It's just 300+ entries of people saying, "I'm having this problem too, and solutions yet?"<br/><br/>If someone can provide me with a solution to the Wi-Fi issue, than I will change my rating in a heartbeat.  The only other thing I don't like about the phone is that it doesn't have a flash on the camera, and I can live fine without it.  I love that I can just plug it into my computer and move media to its folder (I had an old iPhone before...ugh).  I love the expandable memory.  I love the fact that it feels sturdy and not like it will shatter when I inevitably drop it.  I love Cortana and how well she understands me.  But the crappy Wi-Fi is a deal breaker.
one of the best phones for the price you can buy, and very durable
I'm enjoying my phone. Thank you Amazon for such an amazing phone.
wow.. what a great little phone.. for the price you can't beat it.
Works great, long life battery, my family loves all three we own!
This is my first smartphone and I love it. It is easy to use and I am very happy with it.
It's great  and I can unlock it from AT&T; freely and conveniently
Great product for the price. no problems. windows OS is terrific!
like the phone easy to use. amazon was good service and delivery
I love this phone...apps work well....love the microsoft program
Awesome phone. This has converted me away from apple and google.
I only use  handful of features but it seems to be working fine.
as a smart phone it was quite worth it for its price and quality
Phone looks great and i was able to unlock with the help of AT@T
I was a bit hesitant at first to order this phone as this would be my first windows phone.  I must say I am completely satisfied with the phone.  It responds very fast, easy to navigate and just the perfect size.  Its my 2 day and have not one complaint.  I have already ordered another one.  Great phone at an awesome price !!
It performs exactly as my old cell phone. It's easy to operate.
A No-contract Smart Phone for this price? No complaints here :)
Shining and easy to use. A class phone in respect to its price.
First smart phone, so still learning as I go, but am impressed.
I really like this phone. It is a very nice, inexpensive phone.
Best phone for $100, i got this to replace my Lumia 520.<br/><br/>Lumia 635 VS Lumia 520,<br/><br/>1. Bigger and better display.<br/>2. Better camera(although both are 5.0M)<br/>3. Window 8.1
This is a splendid little unit at a terrific price. I love it.
My wife loves her new phone. Quick Delivery, great product!
Shipping was fast and I use my SIM card for att for service
A feature missing is an automatic shut off when call has ended.  This phone was for an elderly disabled gentleman in a Nursing Home.  When he receives a call and that call has ended, the light stays on.  Phone disconnects but does not shut off.  Automatic shutoff is necessary for a disabled person.
perfect
Love it
my son loves the case and i love his phone being protected
upgraded from 520 to 635. Slightly larger and much faster.
A very good phone for the price and the shipping was fast.

Had the 520 model, dropped it and cracked the face, and bought this one as a replacement but, don't like this one at all. features are different than the 520 and I just could not get used to it.  returned it and bought another 520.  Amazon is as usual very good to work with.

Love this phone so much bought at Walmart and had to rebut here!!! Windows 8.1 takes some practice but now nothing else feels right.
Even though I'm a Mac guy, I went ahead and bought this phone (instead of an iPhone) because a) it's a whole lot cheaper, and b) Microsoft offers a "Windows Phone for Mac" application that's supposed to allow the phone to sync with iTunes, iPhoto, etc. So I downloaded and installed the app (on my Mac), spent an hour synchronizing, and found... several GB of stuff on the SD card, none of which the phone would recognize. Folders for Music, Podcasts, Photos, Videos, etc., were all still empty. Took the card out and checked it with my computer; the files were all there and readable. Shrugged, formatted the card (using the phone) and repeated the process. Same result, nothing in the folders, but several GB of stuff the phone said was in an unrecognizable format. I don't know if the problem is with the phone or the Microsoft app, but I gave up at this point and returned the phone to Amazon.<br/><br/>Aside from that, I guess it's an OK low-end smartphone, which is to say it does a lot of things passably, though none particularly well. Probably just fine if you don't have to sync it to a Mac.
better than buying from ATT
Great phone, works awesome!
Best deal on a phone so far
Better than I phone for me.

I love my phone no problem
very chip... very lovly...
Good product as described.
Very good for the price./-
Bought this phone because of the low price and decent reviews. After owning this phone however, I can tell these reviews were premature and over hyped. There is a multitude of problems with this phone so I'll just list them in a random order.<br/>1. Bing is the default search engine and you can't do anything about it.<br/>2. There are only a few browsers to choose from and they constantly crash and close.<br/>3. The screen randomly glitches out, shaking and moving the page. I find myself turning on and off the screen every 5 minutes because of this.<br/>4. The SD card is impossible to remove once it's put in.<br/>5. The Microsoft app store is the worst store there is. There's a real lack of selection and a lack of updates on popular apps.<br/>6. Youtube videos are the only videos that work on this phone.<br/><br/>All in all this phone feels like it's missing basic features that computers in the 90s had.<br/>Works better as an MP3 player than a phone.<br/>I'd pass on this one and get an apple or android product.
This review doesn't reflect anything much about the Windows Phone OS. I personally love it, but it certainly isn't for everyone. If you are not familiar with Windows Phone, you should probably watch a video that goes over its interface and such before purchasing a Windows Phone device to see if its right for you. A great article that does this can be found on Windows Phone Central (http://www.wpcentral.com/windows-phone-81-review). My review primarily discusses the hardware as opposed to the OS.<br/><br/>This phone is effectively the "new" Lumia 520 (released last year). It is extremely inexpensive but has numerous improvements over the 520 from last year. The major improvements are the processor, the wireless radio, and the screen. With the updated Snapdragon 400, the Lumia 635 is smoother and more responsive than the 520. Besides the occasional loading screen on heavier apps (which I tend to blame on the 512 MB of RAM), I would say it runs as older flagships like the Lumia 920. It runs ga... Read more
I am coming from an Apple iPhone 4s. Prior to that I had an iPhone 3s. Before Apple phones, I had Samsungs. Yes, the change to the iPhone 3s was amazing. And I really loved having the front-facing camera on the iPhone 4s. However, the only reasons why I had to really change phones from iP3s to iP4s was because the battery was dying and the iP3s couldn't quite keep up with the iOS updates. It's as if the updates were slowly making the phone more obsolete and draining its battery. Well, that is exactly what was going on with my iPhone4s. I could barely keep a charge on it for more than 4 hours. It would die at the most inconvenient times and I was frustrated with the new phone pricing plans from all three carriers that I would consider: AT&T;, T-Mobile, and Verizon. Who wants to lease a phone these days? And at crazy data plan prices? It just made me sick with the whole idea of having to have a cell phone.<br/><br/>What I really wanted was the Samsung Note 4! I always wanted a Note phone. I kn... Read more

luv my lumia 635 I had the 521 and loved it for years now I have a little bigger screen perfect now for 3 years also
Best budget phone I ever have. I use just for browsing, email and other apps like weather, IM, and Roku controller.
Got the phone, not much happy with it doesn't come with headphones or sub cable. But the delivery is ahead of time.
good Morning. this phone is unlocked you can use any operator in Venezuela with Movistar eg. movilnett and digitel?
Bought one and had to send it back because it didn't work properly, and the one they sent me didn't work either.
My BFF loves the upgrade
Daughter loves the phone

Great phone, great price
Excellent, Good Product.
little small, feel cheap
for the price... 5 stars
It is a good for my boy.
nice product, best price
Got it for a great deal.
It's my own fault. I have tmobile and knew the phone was compatible. I had it changed over but certain things like the dad plan and the internet were not. Everything on the screen (except for calling) don't work because of that fact. I brought it back to t-mobile and they said got o AT&T.; They told me that because I switched over, I should go to T-Mobile. I'm in a no win situation.  My advice to you is if you have at&T; stay with it. if you have t-mobile better pay for the t-mobile version, even if its 50.00 more.
Many bugs, it could start an app or call somewhere, when you do not expect it. So, it worth the money $20 or 40
I can't unlock the phone And I want to replace the Phone.But I am in China.It's very hard to replace the phone.
good as a back up phone
Yes my daughter love it
It is great !  Love It.

Good phone, good price.
I will look no further.
love it love it love it
Great phone for my son.
more than what I expect
I hate this phone. I guess if u want a mini computer in your pocket than its great. But since its not an Android or an I-phone almost ALL of the apps and games I had on my android wont work on it. It is very disappointing to grow fond of certain apps/games and then not be able to use them anymore. If u are interested in buying this phone...i greatly suggest looking at the Windows store first so u will know before u commit if u will have to give up apps/games you've come to depend on.
I love this phone!!!!!

When I went to sign up with this go phone I was informed I had three option, 30, 50, or 60 dollars a month to keep this phone active. I tried to register it online and thru  the phone and those are the only option I was given. I'm retired and use no more than ten minutes of talk time in any given three month period. I don't use internet or Texting. I talked with AT&T; and the phone that you can buy time as needed comes with a phone number pre-installed. So when you by get that version you can by time as needed for this phone. How can AT&T; claim this is a no contract when the only way to activate this phone is to sign up for a minimum charge of 30 dollars a month. and this model cannot use the buy by time card refills  a person can purchase anywhere. From all the question and answers I read, this phone is suppose to be by as you need time not a per month phone..
Fantastic!!! Phone!!!
Great cheap go phone.
an exellent adventure
Exactly what I wanted
I bought this phone for my wife, who uses her phone mostly for email and phone calls.  And for that, it works just fine.  But she can't access the internet on our home wi-fi because the phone will not allow you to set a static IP addresses as I do on my Samsung S-3.  That's likely not a problem for most folks but it's a must for my home network, since DHCP fouls everything up.<br/>But I was able to get an unlock code from AT&T; and connect to my wife's Consumer Cellular account (after putting in the appropriate APN setup as described in one of the reviews here on Amazon).  I was disappointed to learn that AT&T; had offered this same phone for $9.99 the week before but was sold out by the time I discovered it, which is why I bought it on Amazon.  At ten bucks, I would've bought a crate of them!
Love it. Easy to use
This is a nice phone

The Good:<br/>Surprisingly the OS is very solid, not buggy, and pretty fast in windows 8.1. (It's a great Phone OS, not a PC one)<br/>Nokia hardware is incredibly strong, and durable<br/>It's pretty fast for how cheap it is<br/>It does do 4G LTE<br/>It has expandable storage, but it doesn't work right... (Throws fragmentation errors after some time, and requires you to reformat it)<br/>It's not huge, so you can still put it in your pocket as a dude and not worry about breaking it, or looking like you have a book in your pants.<br/>Battery life (with 8.1) is about 3-5 days.<br/><br/>The Typical Microsoft Garbage:<br/>The windows 10 preview update is terrible, so if you are thinking of upgrading or even just getting one of these cheap phones to try it.. Save the money..<br/>The App store is worthless, and even though Microsoft keeps pushing that "one OS for all devices" it's not true.. This won't run .exe's so you are limited to the app store, which is basically endless ad's and no real software. There is no Google Map's, and what they do offer is worse than a good old fashion map. There is no Youtube, you can't get any tools for any real network testing, or find books, music, or really anything else anyone would want to use, the games have endless ad's and even when you pay for them, they still inject ad's into there apps...<br/>There is no flash for a camera<br/><br/>Verdict:<br/>If you have no choice like you broke your phone and you need a cheap replacement phone to use till your able to get a new droid, iPhone, or Ubuntu phone, than this is a fantastic solution. However, as a choice, you would never choose this, as while the hardware is bullet-proof, and the OS is actually surprisingly good, the available applications makes it worthless as anything other than a basic phone.
Verrry smart phone.  Fewer apps than my IPhone.  Some features compatible (contact sharing with IPhone) and easier than IPhone. Camera is OK for pic quality.  No selfies.  Whole lotta phone for the money.  The built in assistant is excellent.  I use the calendar for all my appointments.  Input the location and time and she will remind you when it's time to go,  tell you how to get there, and provide a map and driving instructions.<br/>I took this GoPhone to the local AT&T; store.  They Installed a different sim, transferred all my contacts, ported my existing number all at no charge.<br/>User battery replacement and added memory  is simple.  I charge it every 3 days.  Fewer than 10 texts/day and 2 or 3 voice calls per day.
good back up phone

I never bought mine directly off of here. I bought mine off at&t;, have had it since November of last year and now a couple of months ago its just been acting up. Freezes, keeps kicking back to my phone screen, sometimes the page doesn't even load right and I can scroll past everything and keep going even when the page itself has technically ended. Takes horrible pictures, and the camera seems to be going out and it freezes alot as well. Really I should be complaining to at&t; but they basically can't do anything to fix any of the problems because as they have said "we are not Nokia and have nothing to do with them-we only sell the phone" -.-
Nice basic phone
Such a great toy
great product!!!
cheap...and good
Very good phone!
Very satisfied!!
After loosing my nearly $700 AT&T; Blackberry Passport in Yellowstone Park, I purchased this thing.  It did work, but not well.  At the highest level, the ringer was so low that I could barely hear it.  The speaker would come on randomly and I wouldn't be able to turn it off.  There is no indicator light.  The phone would lock up, so I would have to restart it.  If and until my Blackberry was found, I used this phone as a replacement.  When the thing works, the voice sound quality is excellent and the phone holds a charge for a very long time.  Thankfully, Yellowstone found my Blackberry and returned it to me.
Do like this product. I may buy this next time I surf the internet.
As stated by another reviewer, an important piece of information related to the use of this phone is nowhere to be seen in the description. This phone cannot be used on a GoPhone plan such as the 10 cents per minute plan. It can only be used with an overpriced data plan of at least $30 per month.<br/><br/>AT&T;'s customer service for GoPhone does not exist. This is to not say their reps are scarce or hard to get on the phone. This literally means that as a customer, you have no way of talking to anyone regarding problems you may be encountering with your phone or plan.<br/><br/>I lost around 5 hours of my life playing musical chairs with their customer service reps on two separate occasions. They would transfer me to one department, and then to another, with my final destination always being the automated only service number in the GoPhone pamphlet.<br/><br/>How can you not have human representatives to talk to customers about issues they may be having with your service?<br/><br/>I also notice a pattern of their customer service reps contacting individuals who are having problems through social media & online retailers, in a public display of concern, but ultimately never following up and actually helping those customers.<br/><br/>A simple check of AT&T;'s Facebook page shows how terribly this company treats their customers. Never Again.
So far so good!

Hard to add anything new from all the previous reviews. I love this phone and unbeatable price. I use it with my Consumer Cellular account and spend less the $15 a month for my cell phone usage and a great smart phone. If you like a Windows based phone you cannot go wrong. I don't even mind that it has less apps then Android and iPhone.............really just how many apps does one person need or use????? Cortana is the best and cannot wait to see the Denim update when it's available.

I had a Nokia 520. I loved it and use it with my Consumer Celluar account.  But I dropped it on the sidewalk and cracked the screen. So I purchased the 635. This phone is a little bigger and I like it as good as the 520. However the speaker quality is not as clear as the 520. And I can't get the  data plan (which is included with my text) from Consumer Cellular on either of these phones. But for the price. It is a good phone

Pros: Very reliable, durable, easy to use. Windows 10 o.s. upgrade is coming soon. A pretty decent camera, music sounds great. Syncs easily with other devices. Plenty of memory with additional micro sd card. Best phone I've owned overall.<br/>Cons: No flash or forward facing camera. Less apps available for windows than Google Play or Apple Store (all major apps such as facebook, twitter, linked in, etc. are available)
haha ok Microsoft. so i got this phone on its arrival date connected it to wifi and made simple updates....... so i thought.!!<br/>I updated the lumia 635 to windows 10 and it was slow and laggy and got a crazy error and then phone wouldn't work at all.<br/>I downloaded a recovery tool from via Microsoft and ran the downgrade program and nothing lumia 635 is now back to windows 8 but cant boot up its damaged.
I love this, but it is a little difficult for me to use I am still learning how to use it, this is my first smart phone, so it is a little challenging for me.<br/>I had to take it to a at&t; dealer to set it up for me and still they did not set up all the features, so I called the Help line and still not all features were set up, I eventually was able to turn on my own by continual trial and error.
We experienced a communication tool gradually from the initial horizontal expansion in function, start adding music and photography and other multimedia element, so that it has the entertainment features. The introduction of the network in the longitudinal direction, to put the phone into the vast world, but also spawned a mobile application value chain and other cultural, very good product.
Replaced my 520 for this low-priced LTE gem. To be able to participate in the full smartphone experience with a "cheap" device whose look and performance belie its cost, I mean, how cool is that!? I've loved Nokia since the 5120 (yeah, the Cingular wireless days...I'm telling my age  LOL),  and Microsoft and Nokia are just a match made in heaven. Love, love, LOVE the Lumia! 😊
I like it.

Microsoft is discontinuing lots of included apps, mainly the Microsoft health app which tracks steps/distance/calories, one of the reasons I bought the phone. The included Here Maps app refuses to store maps on SD card, but the Android Here Maps app has no such issue. Nokia's own maps app has more functionality on Android devices than on it's own phones!!!!!
Beware you can not send and receive pictures with this phone. I've tried all the settings and different things I've read on line to fix the issue but still can't send or receive. It's a nice phone other than that. But it's a big deal if you are used to sending pics to family in other parts of the country. Wish I would have known this before I bought mine.
If your current phone does not have a microSIM, ATT refuses to activate the micro-SIM over the phone or online chat. So if your ordering to replace a phone before your upgrade and you're not near an ATT store you are SOL. Phone is great. I guess if you are are activating the phone as a prepaid then you are okay. 5-star phone, ATT crappy customer service.
Returned.

If you are thinking of using a phone for long, don't buy this. I bought it thinking of that I'm only gonna use it for three months top... OK to use for a while
PROS:<br/>-Half-decent autofocus camera<br/>-Has 4G<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>-Screen not terribly sharp<br/>-No front camera or flash<br/>-Pricing not quite aggressive enough<br/><br/>This doesn’t mean the Nokia Lumia 635 is a bad phone, just that it is not the stonking deal that Androids like this one: http://amzn.to/1JtiEZY
I bought this phone to use but decided to give it to my mom who lives in Africa ... Some how my nerves got the best of me and I missed the part about how this phone I locked to AT&T...; How do I unlock it without getting an account with AT&T; .. I already have TMobile .. I really like this phone and thinking of getting 2 more...
I would to start out saying that I am an avid windows phone user.  Starting out on a Lumia 900 and then going to a 920 and needed something in the mean time to hold me over till my next phone because my 920 broke (totally my fault).  I got a 635 and it was what I expected.  For the price it seemed pretty good.... until today.  Today the phone's power button broke or refuses to function.  Note that this phone does not have a physical button for its camera which makes plugging in the phone the only way for the screen to turn on.  For a smart phone that is a pretty big deal I have owned this phone for just about a month.  I check to see if maybe its an issue and can return it for another one.  Nope five days ago it became ineligible for return.  Now I am stuck without a phone and out 100 bucks.  Please reconsider buying this phone it is not at all "NOKIA" quality which I have come to know and what pushed me to become an actual stock owner of a once great company.<br/><br/>Very dissatisfied.<br/><br/>(Update)<br/>I in fact did contact Nokia about a possible warranty covering the device and they agreed to look at it.  I sent in the phone with their prepaid shipping label and awaited for them to look at the phone to make sure it was covered under warranty so they could repair it.  Three days later I got an email stating that due to physical damage to the phone the repair would not be covered under warranty but i could pay to have the phone fixed for ~70 dollars.<br/><br/>The same day before I woke up (sleep during the day I work nights) I receive the phone and The screen has been cracked along the whole phone.  I immediately called the repair center to verify why my phone came back broken when i sent it to them for a small repair that should have been covered under warranty.  According to them the phone was broken upon their receipt.<br/><br/>I went to UPS (who the shipping label from Nokia was for)  and asked about filing a claim because it was apparently broken during shipping.  UPS rudely claimed that Nokia would have to file the claim because they received it broken.  I contacted Nokia about how to forward them to file a claim and their response to me was "The package was in acceptable condition upon receipt so no claim will be filed."<br/><br/>Unbelievable!  Even after going through customer service and supervisors they told me there was no way to insure that I did not send in a broken phone.<br/><br/>After this experience I refuse to purchase another Nokia/Microsoft phone or willing use UPS as a courier<br/><br/>My original one star review still applies
Three stars for the os windows 8. Hard to run, you have to tell it everything and is not very user friendly. Seems like a weak phone in way of drops because I dropped it of my bed onto the carpet and the screen broke. So yes not a bad phone, worth the price but it's about as strong as a plastic paper clip.

This is my first smartphone and I think it's too smart for me.  Up until  now, I've used a flip phone which gives me calls and text, no wifi, just plain talk.  I decided that I not only needed this phone but that I deserved it and so I bought it at the att store.  I also bought a $100 card which gives me 1000 minutes and lasts one year.  Well, I love the wifi but everything I touch costs money.  I spent nearly $2.00 setting up my voicemail because the sound was terrible.  Finally, fixed the sound and thought I was safe from spending unwisely but I downloaded a "free" app which turned out cost me another .20 after I installed it.  I have yet to make one call since I bought it three days ago other than voicemail and can't for the life of me understand how this card can last one year without buying another before then.  I only need the phone for emergency calls mostly, texts from my daughter and back but those apps are dangerous.  I'm a kindle hd user and at least when I get an app there I know if I will have to pay more money for a free app.  So, if you're over 50 and not of the android age, I beg to warn you that if you buy this lovely little phone, be careful how you use it because it doesn't take much to spend that $100 before you know it.
For the dollar it has decent features. However, it's not enough to save it from the poor quality build. From the cheap kid's toy feel plastic to the absurdly dumb snap on case, it fails to be nothing more than a novelty windows 8.1 phone. Spend a bit more to get a better quality build phone.
You really can't get a better phone for this price. Runs quick and smoothly, looks great, and it's easy to use. The main drawback is the camera. Don't expect to take awesome pictures with this phone. Plus, it doesn't have a forward-facing lens or flash. Aside from that, excellent phone.
Good overall phone. I added it to Cricket Wireless so that I can have unlimited minutes/texting, and still have wifi wherever there is a wireless hotspot. The sound is very tinny - especially with a phone case. Speaker function is almost unusable, but otherwise a reliable phone.
This is a very competitively priced phone, but kinda cheaply made.  No flash, and its bulky.  Windows Phone OS is OK, but no real YouTube app was a deal-breaker.  Also couldn't install a budgeting app I like to use, and the mobile site that the app provides didn't work either.

it's cheap but easy to use ,best phone for elders!it can be unlocked with unlock code bought on the ebay , very good ! but no camera ,low solution of screen ,no flash led ,small storge, bad feeling of case，but all,it's cheap it's enough :)
I can't get this phone to work. I bought it for using as a camera. Not as a phone. I understood it would work as a camera without a phone connection. I don't understand what to do to get it to work. Contact person would be appreciated.
Decent beginner phone, great introduction to Windows phone.  Shape of phone is awkward to hold and buttons are very hard to push.  This does not reflect on the seller however it makes me wonder if I would buy a Nokia phone again.

This phone will not show a notification, or anything about a voicemail on AT&T; until days later. Will be changing ASAP. Other options make it a likable phone, but not tell you that voicemail is waiting for days? Ridiculous.
I LOVE THE AT&T; NOKIA LUMIA PHONE.  THE ONLY THING I DON'T LIKE IS THE BATTERY GOES DOWN AND YOU ARE NOT EVEN USING IT. IS THERE A SOLUTION FOR IT. I HAVE TURNED OFF EVERYTHING I CAN BUT THE BATTERY STILL GOES DOWN.
Hate, hate, hate this phone!!! I think Windows has some great potential. There are some things I do like about this phone as far as ease of use. But you just do not want it. The app selection is sub par at best. There either isn't an app or it's only a beta. Which means it's only in the testing stages and you can't use all of the features. The apps that you can use crash constantly. The quality of the camera is horrible. Everything looks fuzzy. I've had this phone for 5 months, and 5 months worth of pictures of my daughter are absolute crap. It's easier to take a video and screenshot the video! I can also tell that the battery life is starting to diminish. The physical phone itself is okay, it's very easy to learn how to use compared to an android. But until Windows works on it's programming and app selection, I'll be switching back to Android.
Greatly priced! Bought this for my sister because she needed another phone with her contract plan. Even though it is a go phone it worked with her contract plan and it is great.  You can't beat it for the price.
I love this phone! I had the 520 and felt I needed to up grade. Not enough room. I switched also because I also had a Droid in between and I was not happy. This 635 seems to handle me well. Swift and cute,
Best phone for $30 you can possibly buy.  I replaced my $300 Samsung mini when it broke for the second time under warranty.  Nokia takes way better pictures also, and now they have Candy Crush for Windows
I Appreciate the Iterm was received in time but I got problem where the phone want unlocking code and I don't have it.can u please assist me in this regard.the phone IMEI number is 353047064144433.thanks
Had to return-very hard to get case off. Also all of a sudden, (after a few days) phone froze up. Others say it is a great phone and it probably is-I just couldn't handle trying to open it and using it.
Great little phone for the price, if you break your smartphone and cant afford to buy another unitl contract ends this is the one to have.  Nothing fancy but still works good.  you just cant beat it.
I am not using this as a phone, just a pocket PC.  Camera works well.  Mainly it is my solitaire machine.  Forty bucks may seem high for that, buy the touch screen and color display make it worth it.
Bought this for my mom who has experience using smart phones, but has not's of difficulties with this one. Wish I could return for an LG.  I got it for the great reviews.  But not so great for us.
The good: it is cheap. It charges quickly. The battery is decent.<br/>The bad: everything else, especially the window cr*p you got to deal with, and the poor apps (or simply lack of apps).
I love window phone.

The phone was brand new and worked great. However, it can only be used as a GoPhone. I was hoping to use it with consumer Cellular, I was unable to even with technical assistance.
Very poor audio quality.  Had to return it and replacement phone was just as bad.  Otherwise it worked fine.  AT&T; did not seem to appreciate providing no contract service.
I would highly recommend this phone if you are making a venture into the Smart Phone arena, and are not looking to spend a fortune.  In this case, I wanted an AT&T; compatible phone, but I did not want to go back to the AT&T; store to purchase one.  If you do, you are at great risk of a plan change, and increased costs.  This is a Windows 8.1 phone, and it behaves very well.  Once you learn the navigation, the phone is quick, clear, and works well with blue tooth as well.  You should be aware this is a phone that takes a mini SIM card. That is not a problem at all.  The AT&T; store will transfer your data, and swap the card into this phone absolutely free.
Got this for hubby. He wanted it cause of Cortana but after awhile the it was just like any phone. It's a good phone but downside, no flash and no front camera.
I bought this phone for the sole purpose of playing free games on the Microsoft Store. As a "Less then fifty dollars" gaming console it does very well.
Purchased this phone as a backup and to experience a windows phone. At $56 bucks you can not go wrong.<br/>Not giving it a 5 cause no front facing camera.
I ordered three of them and the screen on one of them looks like it was dropped on the ground before it was attached to the phone- very dirty and smudgy.
This phone is great for someone who once a phone to sink with their windows 8.1 computer. The go part of this is great for someone who wants no contract.
Excellent phone for the money.  A front facing camera is mandatory for 5 stars on any smart phone.  What a difference that would make for this phone?

It does everything I need it to do but it is restricted a lot of ways. I like this one better [...]
the navorgator apps suck but that could just be me and after i've had it for about 1 year and its starting to freeze on me.
I was looking for a phone a bit larger than my Lumia 520, and this is not it. I returned it the same day it was delivered.
was great until now most apps won't open, including phone and text and most config apps. so, the phone is now useless...
Amazing phone, the windows 8.1 operating system works perfectly and it is very easy to use. Nokia makes great phones!!
This is my first cell phone and I really like it.  Good example of you don't have to spend a lot to get great quality.
Returned to Amazon hassle free. Amazon probably has the easiest return procedure of any retailer.  Phone too small for me. Keyboard too small for my fat fingers. It's an ok phone for the price.  NOT any AT&T; sim card in your current AT&T; phone  will fit it. My sim card was too long for it. Back is a little difficult to remove. I don't think I'd recommend this phone for an older person, especially if you have big fingers or arthritis in them.
I didn't hear the reviews as bad when I bought the phone. I figured, Windows phone, it should be able to do what my Rugby Droid phone did and I figured maybe a little more. Boy was I wrong. With my business, I need certain apps. I can't believe how many are not compatible nor do they have updates or upgrades for the Windows phone to fix any of the problems this phone possesses. I'll never buy it again. I like the Droid smart phones.
AAA
It is very okay; only wish I could get Windows 7 or 10 instead of the 8 I've got on it.  Who thought that up?
Sucks it has no front camera 📷......and had to reset. It it wouldn't click on my photos,messages.or pictures
Phone would not charge.Nor would a computer recognize it. They could be good, but the one I got was junk!
You know it's Windows.<br/><br/>Don't expect much.  Bugs and stupid mistakes are part of their package.
Good for the price point, I actually use this as a backup for my other lumia now and as a media device.
The headphone jack does not work. Microsoft and Nokia support told me to buy a new headset that specifies compatibility with this phone. I finally got a "compatible" headset last week, and it still doesn't work. Today, I was advised by AT&T; to drive 40 miles (round-trip) to an AT&T; Device Support Center to have them look at it on the spot. So I did. Turns out, the only way for Nokia to replace the phone involves them charging $139 to my credit card (twice what I paid for the phone) and me trusting that it will be refunded after they receive my defective phone and see that the screen isn't damaged. It's been a huge, frustrating waste. I've spent more time on this (2 months without a headset and countless hours on the phone with Microsoft, Nokia and AT&T;, plus drive time) than the phone is worth.
Love the phone, but I can't get it to connect to my home wifi, it's not a singular problem with my phone, one of my coworkers is having the same difficulty. It also doesn't recognize correct passwords for certain secure wifi networks. I brought it to a Microsoft store and they had no idea what was wrong with it. I'm currently trying to find a router that will work with my phone.
Directions were very difficult to follow and I was not able to get the results I was supposed to get.
I cannot call the number 800-831-0500 on the back of the phone to update my account! Any suggestion?
I hate this phone but it was cheap and you get what you pay for, and as purely a PHONE, it's fine.
Good Phone.<br/>Not many apps are released for Windows OS, but otherwise, the phone is very good.
I expected better for an upgrade from the 520 but this phone has terrible volume and sound capability.  Speaker phone is almost useless - can hardly hear it at full volume.  No matter how I set up the phone it sends SMS out several times a day and makes charges against the minutes even when powered off.  This act more like a vampire device than a phone.
The windows set up is terrible. I will never own another phon elike this one. It is so so slow.
it's just a phone, i only use it as a PHONE and a smattering of texting, it serves its purpose
Originally bought this phone to replace Moto X that overheated. Crashes constantly. No front facing camera, while rear facing camera takes grainy terrible pictures. Few apps in the appstore. Map function very slow and inaccurate. Cortana rarely understands what I say. Inaccurate touch screen. I like that I is customizable, but that's about it.
I like this phone and just am using it for Skype at home. Works very well with the Wifi.
Ordered 2 phones,  unable to unlock 1 phone.  It says already registered with someone.
my phone is not working it keeps turning off. what can be done about this? Thank you.
great phone even after being dropped, it didn't stop working like the first one did!!
Hi Mr/Ms I was order phone, you order to me wrong thing is book I need my phone.
I bought this phone for my son and he loves it.  Great phone at a great price!!
Not bad but is pretty basic. A lot of apps aren't available. No front camera.
A cheap phone. Good for everything a smart phone does except taking pictures
They don't meet my expectations .I bought them to use it out of the country
Cannot get notification from apps such as FB, Messenger, Viber, Groupme.
Ok
It was not what I thought it would b like but I gave it to my grandson
Battery died within two weeks.  Web surfing is extremely poor.  Texting and calling worked fine until the battery gave out.  This is my second Nokia Lumia product and I am officially ceasing my attempts with these phones.  Sub-par in every way possible.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PHONE!  We've only had it 3 months and is no longer working! cant return it, cant get it replaced, and soon microsoft will no longer support windows on this phone!!!!!! Please DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON THIS PHONE!!!!!!!!
I knew the Windows Phone ecosystem was much more limited than Android or Apple phones, but I didn't realize just how limited until I bought this. The hardware is solid, especially for the price, but I kinda regret not going with an Android option.
it is locked by att and can't be unlockced even after using it for more than a year.<br/>att doesn't handle the unlocking this phone since it is purchased by amazon so users are left with no option but to use this crap phone with att sim.
Love this phone....it does everything I need and is easy to use.
Screen did not respond to touch after 2 weeks. Do not purchase.
Good mobile for the price thanq amazon for delivering in time.
Bluetooth does not work on this phone. Microsoft has this as a known issue and still sells it. yeah it is cheap but if you need Bluetooth you are out of luck. come on amazon, sell this knowing Bluetooth does not work?
great phone except for no notification light and led flash
Simply Awesome. Super fast delivery. Everything perfect.
I don't recommend this phone as lock on/off, battery meter and few others problems started after use of 10 days. My return date just over and it's now turned useless. Total loss of 40 bucks.
This phone works but is not worth the money. It has too much on its display and is hard to adapt to. I've had a Samsung, iPhone, even an HTC phone, and they were all better and easier to use
no instructions on how to use it and not easy to use
I bought this phone recently and am disappointed. There are fewer apps available than I realized and several that do exist operate differently and less well than android or ios. For example square reader is not available for Windowsphone  so I had to switch to PayPal card reader. When I use their reader I must login with my password each time. I  have a complex password for security and that takes time and I sometimes must enter it twice if my fingers miss the correct buttons. Facebook does not operate the same. There is no option to edit a post or comment I have made  and often videos I try to play do not load.  I do not like any of the navigation apps I have tried  and Google maps is not available. I like using Firefox for a browser and it is not available. The YouTube app is poor and there is no way to search for a video. I have to access YouTube through the Google browser which does seem to work well enough. There are two games I like to play which are not available so I carry my iPhone around and play when I have WiFi access. The sky map app is perhaps as good as what I used on ios but I am not yet accustomed to it. I have had an impossible time customizing the background and tiles so I have given up on that and have a stark-looking screen. That's ok but I would like more options than just light or dark backgrounds. It looks like I should be able to use my photos for a background but I have been unsuccessful. Oh and I listen to music on amazon music player but that is not available on this phone. No access to my music library! The hot link function for emails does not work so I can't access anything from email directly.  I could go on and on. Perhaps one day these problems will be resolved but for now I would  go android or ios.
Internal microphone stopped working after a week.
They stold my new cellphone before I activated ..
Very good windows phone with a lot of potential.
Works great for young kid instead of an itouch.
First time I bought Windows OS , it is not user friendly and product Speaker and camera are not good.<br/>Good things battery backup ad phone response is good.
It was locked and caused me a lot of trouble
It's a bang for your buck! Fast and Smoth!
hard time getting app to come up on phone
easy to use and find apps or information.
worst phone ever, do not buy this! Used it for 30 seconds and already want to throw it in the garbage. Never buying a Windows phone again!
Excelent smartphone and for price beter.
Quick delivery product as described....
will not sink with my pc,dont know why.
Battery died after using for 3 months.
too confusing for one so technologically deficient.  contract was way too long and did not meet my needs.  returning the phone.
Roughly 25% of the web sites I click on end up crashing the browser (Internet Explorer and other top rated one's I've tried). The map and navigation is slow and poorly designed.  After installing an SD card, any photo's stored on it are completely inaccessible.  It let's me take a picture, and show's it as saved for a couple hours, then it turn's all grey and i get a message reading "Can't get picture.  Try again later."
Good basic smart phone for the price.
The worse cell phone I have ever owned. I do not like windows as an operating system. It is slow and the apps are horrible.
$50, can't go wrong with this phone.
Good phone...Granddaughter loved it!
Windows phone is limited to apps...
Was ok and the mailing was on time.
this is a terrific phone and value.
Item as described, shipped quickly.
Cortana is a technological marvel.
good phone, i enjoy the the phone.
It's good but having no front cam
The volume is extremely low!
for my nephew, very nice!
It's good for soft users.
This thing has become a nightmare. I immediately realized that most windows apps were not going to work well and just got over it and tried to be satisfied using this for calls, texts and a little web browsing. Windows apps stink. Got it. But it now fails to do even the most basic things. I've never used a gadget so riddled with glitches and problems. I struggle just to make and receive calls and texts. The phone will suddenly open up an app or close the one I'm using, or it will suddenly shut down for no apparent reason. Sometimes it will refuse to shut down. The list of problems is very long. Sadly, I'm too late to return it. Sadly, it appears I just got a bad one, as most others seem very happy with theirs. Cross your fingers that you're one of the lucky ones if you buy this.
It is a nice gadget, but no phone.  I can call out, but no one can call in.
Im up and down on this
great phone for value.
great phone for 50 dls
The phone did not work from day one. Cortana  only read text messages out loud and now does not even do that. The Here Drive does not speak, have to look down while driving to read the directions myself. AT&T; cannot help with Cortana, you have to call Nokia and they don't answer their phones. By the time I figured out all I'm missing on this phone, that obviously was sold to me as an irregular phone by Amazon, the time has expired to exchange it. I know it is irregular because other people's features work according to this thread. If I ever purchase a phone through Amazon again, I will have it checked out thoroughly.
This was a horrible experience! Got this for my mother and after getting it set up at the AT&T; store, it was doing crazy stuff and someone else's contacts, messages and photos replaced my Mothers info. She could make and receive calls, could receive texts but that was it. It was a week of confusion until I got back to take her back to the store. Long story short, they discovered it was a demo phone probably stolen from a AT&T; store.....not NEW even though I cut it out of the plastic package! Someone had definitely had their SIM card in it. Now to package it back up and try to get refunds on it and the assessries I bought at the same time.
Just what I wanted.
Well, it works, so that's something.  It doesn't work with Google Chrome........ it will not download apps from Amazon and the amazon apps available are for shopping and kindle.  In other words, if you have a google cloud or an amazon cloud, be prepared to have to build a microsoft cloud, because this sweet little gadget will not let you access either.  You can't shop in the Google store either.  Oh, and it runs on explorer.<br/><br/>Three stars, because it takes decent pictures and you can access some social media (facebook, twitter, tumblr), but not instagram.  For the price, you get a phone with a few bells and whistles.
NOT SENIOR FRENDLY
It perfect for me.
Got the phone, and started checking all the settings, big mistake. I accidently turned on the feature for sight impaired where it tells you which icon selected and to double tap to get app to come up. Couldn't get the phone to function, was unable to get to settings to disable.<br/> Had to take to ATT store to get turned off.<br/><br/>Volume so low had it on speaker, volume set at max and could barely hear caller.<br/><br/>Feature I hated was the select ring tones settings. When you selected a ring tone it didnt play as sample of tone. I had to use another phone to call this one to hear ring tone.  Back It Went.
Good price point.
Battery life sucks but at least I have something to do while I'm pooping. Sure it definitely makes pooping take longer with Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and the Windows App Store at my finger tips but who doesn't love being able to troll Facebook posts about completely ridiculous political propaganda whilst dropping a deuce? Sure I could plop, drop, wipe and go... but like many other people I love the smell of my own poo and now with this phone I can share my loose consistency stools with everyone on my favorite social networks!
Its off the chan
husband loves it
love this phone
excellent phone
I hate this phone.  It has locked a lot so you couldn't do anything with it, not even turn it off.  I had to take it in where they removed the battery, tinkered with it and replaced it.  I need to go through this each time it locks?  The screen is terrible in most light.  It is too large for most pockets and a pain to wear in a case attached to my waist as I do a lot of hiking.  If there was an emergency, I would be lucky to be able to get in quickly to dial for help.
Phone keeps cutting off. Need a new battery.
It's freeze up
Cheap and Cool
I've wont use.
Love it works as it should no trouble
Doesn't work
Great phone.
Just because
Great phone!
The glowing reviews here are proof positive that Microsoft has multitudes of paid shills who spend their workdays promoting Windows junk, no matter how awful the product may be. The Windows phone platform is so awful it lost a million users from Q1 2014 to Q1 2015, while Android and IOS were adding users.  WP is down to 2.5% market share...don't you think there might be a reason? Oh, yeah, it sucks.  WP8 is incredibly un-intuitive. Good luck figuring out how to do even basic functions you did on your previous smartphone platform; and when you ditch WP8 like the aforementioned million users did, good luck with the transfer back to a usable platform.  WP8 is the "dead man walking" of phone OS's.  Microsoft is about to release WP10 in the hope of rescuing their phone platform from the dustbin of history.  It won't work (the much-touted "upgrade" from WP8 to 8.1 did nothing to slow the platform's decline).This phone only has one thing wrong with it...it's a Windows phone. I hate Google's privacy invasions as much as anyone, and I refuse to buy into Apple's overpriced walled garden, but the WP platform is a joke. A sick joke that cost me a lot of time and hassles.
Excellent phone, and with ability to install 64 GB micro, you can have a ton of music, audio books etc....i'm not into games so what is available is fine with me.  The map app is awesome as you can download additional maps to use offline. This is great as I use this phone in South America.  The unlocking was pretty easy so do not need contract.  Again, great for South America
I HAD SEVERAL OF THESE NEVER AGAIN MINE WERE DUDES I WILL NEVER BUY THIS PHONE AGAIN NOR WILL I RECCEMEND
I purchased this phone December of last year.  It is already giving me problems.  It has an echo when I am on a call, I can actually hear myself repeating every word, and if you hold it too close to your ear you will drop your call.  I am not pleased with this phone, especially when I paid close to $80 for it and my sister got the same phone for half that price.
good choice
Great Phone
I want to love this phone. But this is the second Lumia I've bought. First one I bought last November. It was having serious malfunctions by March. Couldn't use the music player, couldn't access photos, the internet would only connect occasionally. I gave Nokia another chance. I bought the 635 at the very beginning of August. 2 months in, I couldn't receive photo messages or send them. Friends would send me a message or vice versa and I would have no idea if we were able to communicate because my phone wouldn't respond. At&t; replaced the sim card twice, both times it fixed the problem but then the same thing would happen 2 weeks later. Once again, the music player is being finicky and jumping around, sometimes not working at all. The photos won't show up sometimes and will automatically flip you back to the start screen if you try and access them. I wanted to think it was a defect but people please listen! I have had two different lumias from them, experiencing the SAME problems with both of them after 2-4 months. Avoid these phones!!!
It did not function for me because I live in Dominican Republic and it cannot be unblocked unless I had a contract for 6 months and I cannot do it from distance. I will try another way of unblock but I still does not know if the company will be able to unblock it. I did not see when I bought it if it was unbloked or not, a big mistake.
I love it!
perfect ㅜㅜ
Good sale!
I got three of these for my kids, so I could have them on my ATT phone plan without a long term contract.  They worked for this.  However a big gripe I have with windows phones is that they do not have any effective parental controls, and no apps available for windows phones to do this either.
Excelente
Excellent
Thank you
muy bueno
the camera is not working.
It's a great phone for the price, but the lack of LED makes no sense. The cost increase of adding LED should be minimal, and would not affect the total cost of the phone much. The screen isn't great either. Make sure you get this phone on a deal, and do not pay full price.
I bought it from AT&T; website. After 20 days it stopped working. And when I spoke to them they said they can replace only within 15 days. Watching youtube will go blank screen and after that you need to remove the battery to start the phone again.
No Flash Player Available for Windows Phone!!! A REALLY BIG NEGATIVE for me!!! WTF!!! You'd think, 'ya know, WINDOWS PHONE? Can't watch my Hopper on it!!! Not bad if you don't need it, plenty of other cool apps for it.
Windows Beta 8.1 is buggy.  Cortana quit hearing me after one day and phone often rings out and caller hears ring but nor me nor I them in spite of turning volume up.  Either Windows 8.1 is buggy or the phone or both.
Waiting for a replacement. AT&T; store says the unit is nor identifying the sim card. I will know more in about 10 days. The collection of apps are really something if I can get the phone going. I am in hope.
This phone is a piece of garbage Doesn't have apps That everyone uses Like instagram snap chat Clash of clans etc I didn't buy it on amazon but I'm typing from it right now no front camera also
Not to terrible, good for viewing fb and msg and internet viewing. I have so probe with crashing to desk top. Kind of annoying. Windows phones dont have as much support as ios and android.
Junk phone sucks
worked one day after I put my personal information it now no way to clear all my information so cant send it back. it wont boot up.Not the sellers fault product is a lemon.
I have had my phone for 4 months and it is nothing but problems. Lousy camera. Calls do not ring through. Phone goes to mute all the time. Would not recommend this phone.
nice!
No front camera. Slow phone. Most apps like instagram, facebook, and tinder are all beta apps. Of course snapchat is still not on windows app store...
hey, it does not support google maps. instead, some pos gmaps+. can't get any directions. what do i do when i want to get home using mass transit?  i could depend on google maps. but not this poc. microsoft should be whopping ashamed of itself. hire me as ceo and everything else might go crash but not a decent competitive mobile maps app. where are google's competitors? is there no money in mobile map apps???
buy HTC<br/><br/>annoying.. it adds " WAP " to URL or address bar<br/>so I get error ..." not valid "  address
have had nothing but trouble sending and receiving media content by text messaging.AT&T; store could not help.really disappointed
I am not a fan of the windows phone. It is not user friendly at all. I am so annoyed and cant wait for my contract to be over.
Good
good
Good
good
good
Its not Unlocked....<br/><br/>i cant activated with T Mobile nor Metro PCS ....figures im returning it now
Windows makes a great computer platform but horrible phone platform. Cant wait till my contract is up.
No google play, no StarzPlay, HBOGo or any number of apps I like,  I gave it to my kids
Oh humm, some neat features otherwise it's like a  corporate marketer living with you.
when I place my sim card in this phone it asked me for a code can somebody tell me how to unlocked this phone the instructions on the back of the phone said that I can use my own sim card but it's  not taking it............
I use it just for GPS for few month without SIM<br/>Now I try to to put SIM to use also for phone<br/>And I get massage ERROR SIM<br/>Look like SIM missing<br/>It's late now to return because it's only 30 days return
It looks good but I get static when I talk on the phone with others.  I wasted $40
There was no micro-USB sync cable included as advertised and as stated on the box.
A+
It's a step up from my Blackberry. No flash for the camera.
No contract but tied to AT&T; for at least SIX months!
I did not like the phone,,did. Not realize it wasnt an android,,,but had trouble finding things on it even after reading the books
Not  what I hoped for.  The 520  is a better phone.
worst phone ever no goodI'm about to send it back
l order this phone for my husband and he love it
it is really a cool Android Devices ! now i  Recommend it everyone ， it is really good, friends are all used it
Decent phone to use, but after three days, the lock button is broken. Which is very disappointing.
I received this phone for Christmas, so I have been using it for about three months. All was well until last week. I plugged in my phone to recharge it. When I unplugged it and tried to turn it on, the phone did not respond. Eventually, I was able to turn the phone on, but the battery level was still very low and all of my contacts, etc were gone. We took the phone to the AT&T; warranty center. They determined I needed a new phone. When I received the new phone, it was only the front of the phone. I installed my SIM and the battery from the bad phone into the "Like New" phone I received. Again, I plugged it in so it could charge. While adding contacts, the phone displayed "good-bye" and shut off. It hasn't worked since. I took it to the AT&T; store where the employee told me that it was probably a bad battery and that I should go to Battery Plus to have the battery tested. (Which I did, and the battery tested fine.) The employee also told me that these were low-end phones and I shouldn't expect a lot from it. He strongly encouraged me to purchase an iPhone. Overall, a very disappointing experience.
I wanted a unlocked phone and not at&t;
Where do I begin,Wow I so wanted to like this phone.but just about everything about it sucks!!!!!!!!! They tell you can get android apps, well you can't and I repeat you can't. You can get their versions of Android apps, but only half of the apps are available and only half of those work right(having nightmares of vista all over again).<br/>On top of the things you already know that the phone doesn't have like front facing camera and a flash for the camera. You can't download a Compass app the hardware isn't there. Some people need this some people don't., but the hardware really should be there!<br/>Now for Facebook people your S.O.L to because this app sucks to. This phone app makes it complicated to change you profile pic and I still don't know how to change the cover photo. Facebook's massaging is a real pain and doesn't work quit right.<br/><br/>Why do people like this phone is a mystery to me, I guess it's better then having no phone!!!!!!
I absolutely love ❤ my new phone this phone is awesome. I love it.
I have  returned the  item
this phone is over ratted hard to under stand and use
PRETTY GOOD PHONE
This phone is horrible. Cortana sucks. When I am using the internet, it constantly goes back to the homepage and I have to start all over. The app store is bland, as there is not much to choose from..not as good as the apple or Android store. Also, sometimes it will start to vibrate for no reason and I have to turn it off to get it to stop. Don't waste your money on this phone.
I purchased this phone Wednesday and found that it was NOT a new phone that I was led to believe. Also the SIM card was defective, had to purchase a new card, still not sure if I will be able to activate this phone!  very unhappy with this purchase at this time!!! Would not recommend this person.
need instruction on how to unfreeze  can get to scroll up or down got to tap twice on main menu screen to get it to open or sometimes take the battery out to get too the main menu can I get some hheellpp pplleeaassee!!!!!!!  att nokia lumia 635 no contrat go phone
My very first Smartphone.  I'm very pleased with it and its features, especially Cortana.  Just one thing:  An unexpected annoyance as a result of my buying this Windows smartphone:  A couple of evenings ago around 6 pm there was a knock at the door.  I thought it might be a delivery, so I opened the door.  There was a young woman carrying a clipboard.  I ask her if she's selling something or doing a survey.  She tells me that I have AT&T; for my wireless but they notice I don't have AT&T; U Verse.  She asks me question after question and I told her I wasn't going to tell her how much I was paying for Comcast.  Keeps peppering me with questions until I finally tell her, "I'm going to save you and me a lot of time.  I am not interested.  Please leave."  She did but first told me that their monthly rate for U Verse is a hundred and fifty-something dollars.  I don't remember the exact amount.<br/><br/>I'm going to have to get a NO SOLICITING sign for my door.  I had a red and gold one affixed to my door, but the door has been painted black, and the sign got covered up, too.
Bad phone operating system s terrible I had It for 2 day's and It went crazy, would not do anything It locked up cortana talked all the time could not get In the settng's to shut her up. Stay away from this phone  returned It ASAP.
Not good
Mediocre
its okay
The phone works fine but there is no support for it. So as long as it works you are fine. The phone screwed up pictures on my computer they changes my jpg files to nar files and no one knows anything.
I love the phone.  The owner of the phone, said it was new.  It was used, the previous owners information was still in the phone.  I paid for a new phone not used.
Since this was my first purchase of this type of phone and I really had no idea what I was getting, it has been a real trip trying to figure it out.  After seeing some other people's phones, I know that I should not have gotten a Windows based phone.
The min I can get rid of this phone I am going to. A windows phone is a piece of crap. Don't try it... you will hate it.
One out of three was usable. No adhesive on one of them and the other bubbled up so much I finally gave up and tossed it
The sim reader was broken in this new phone! Thank goodness it was covered under the att stores warrenty.
I got the phone for my mom and she just activated last week and the phone won't hold a charge or work.
They phone rings very low can't hear the phone ring at all need to talk to someone about that???????
Phone is terrible. Cortana is useless always messes up the words. Siri is much better on the iPhone.
Looks and feels like a toy, very cheap indeed I bought it as a gift. I'm too embarrassed to send it
garbage
Phone is intermittently unable to send text messages.  I've had the phone for a few months.  This is a known issue on the internet for the phone on multiple carriers, but AT&T; tech support acts like it is the 1st time they ever heard of it, which is complete BS.  Spent an hour on the phone with AT&T.;  They had no answers, typical power down power up.  Then they told me to go to an AT&T; store, so I can waste more time.  They said if it continues to happen, then they can give me another Lumia 635 that may have the same issue.<br/><br/>Steer clear if you ever need to send a text message.  Google the problem and you'll see multiple blogs of people complaining about the Lumia 635 on multiple carriers with no solution.
Needs WiFi to download and I don't keep a computer! Disappointment.
good price, low quality.it's really hard to use a Windows Phone
Nit satisfied at all. No charger  no sim card n it freezes up.
Not a good phone<br/>Basic functions unavailable
Is this phone working on all networks worldwide or locked on AT&T; ?<br/><br/>Thanks
IT SUCKS. NEVER SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT THAT ONE
At&t; refuse to unlock it until I use their services for 6 months!
RETURNED, DID NOT WORK.
Not what I expected.
does this cell. is new on the box?
STOP RAISING THE PRICES
I tried. I really tried. I have been wanting to try a Windows 8 phone for a long time. I have been using various Android phones since 2010, but my first smart phone was a phone running Windows Mobile 6. I really wanted to give Windows Phone 8 a go, if for nothing more than professional curiosity (I am a desktop support professional working in IT) but I sent this phone back after a week. Never even got as far as activating it on AT&T; service. I just could not get Windows 8 phone to be something I could live with, or even get used to.
This was a present for my mom.  She had a $15 go-phone, so I thought this would be an improvement.  She already had an account with AT&T; for $29.00/month for 250 min and unlimited anytime minutes after a certain time and weekends.  When we went to local AT&T; store to switch out the sim cards, the At&T; store closed her current account and advised her that since this is a smart-phone, she would have to have a data plan for an additional $25/month on her account.  This would provide her with a 1 GB data, unlimited text and talk.  After she took the phone home, the volume was so low (even at the highest volume) and basically could only hear if it was in your hand near your ear.  Took the phone back to AT&T; store and ask to go back to her old phone and old plan.  Was told that because they had already changed her plan, she could go back to the old phone, but would still have to pay an extra $10/month on her old plan, because the plan she had been on was no longer available.  Boy did I mess up!  Nokia had always had a good reputation in the past, but apparently we got a bad phone.  Would not buy again.
It has a mind of it's own.
I can't here the phone even when I turn It to # 10 . Is there something I can do to turn the phone up more? Please get back with me.
I'm sure its a good phone I did not no how to use it and was very unhappy with it but you could love it .
I am not able to use this phone....no where or software is able to unlock it. Pretty sad right now
This phone is light as paper I wouldn't get it unless you REALLY need one and are extra carefu
Smaller then I expected<br/>SIM card may not be compatible if you're exchanging phones<br/>Had to return
I need an unlocked smartphone, but this phone is a locked phone.
This is a bare bones phone for a cheap price and it taught me never to buy a phone with the Windows operating system again.
Wrote an earlier review, leaving one star.  Apparently I received a lemon the first time around.  After returning it to Amazon (for a full refund plus no shipping charges!) I continued to search for the perfect budget phone to replace my aging and cracked screen iPhone 4 which I received free from AT&T; when I signed up with them a little over 2 years ago.  After concluding that every replacement phone would either cost me a 2 year subscription AND anywhere between $100-200 for the phone, I rolled the dice and ordered another Lumia 635 from Amazon, hoping my first experience with this sub-$50 phone was a fluke.  Boy, was I pleasantly surprised!  My earlier complaint that either the ringer and/or the incoming phone call's voices were barely audible, this second phone is entirely what I hoped the first would be:  Loud, clear sounds produced when new mail or an IM arrives, when the phone rings with a new caller, etc.  The phone's size, screen clarity and functions earn this a 4-star rating from me.  Five stars would be my vote IF the phone had a single-action mute button to shut off sounds at night and a flash for the camera.  Otherwise for under fifty bucks, you can't beat this deal.
My man did not understand how to work the phone so he didn't like it
Out of power so quickly!!! We have to recharge after 24 hours standby !!!
Did not know it was a pre-paid phone
I can use this phone in Venezuela
Bought two of these refurbished just 2 weeks ago.  DON'T buy. First off getting them activated took days and then using them for minimum 4 minutes they get so hot you can hardly hold to your head!  Also one has already locked up several times and takes forever to get to turn off or anything.  Took to AT&T; store last night and he did everything, including taking off the back and couldn't get it to work.So total waste of money and won't be able to use minutes.  Sure didn't like the Windows app on it, go for an Android!!!!!
It sucks!
For the price, the Lumia 635 is a decent smartphone.  Unfortunately, Windows Phone 8.1 is still quite lacking as an operating system.  It's really not even fair to compare it to iOS or Android -- which are far more mature than WP.  Apps from Tier 1 vendors are sorely missing.  Apps that do exist are often buggy and/or do not work fully.  (I'm getting warnings from these apps saying they won't work with my WP version!)  The immaturity aside the phone does work.  The call quality is very good and very close to iPhone quality.  The speakerphone is good.  I've had no issues with signal strength even from my limited location.  (I'm lucky to get two bars unless I'm near a window which only then gets me a third.)  I'm sick of Microsoft's requirement to "Sign-In" to everything on the planet.  They try to get you to sign in to XBOX just to accept terms of their service agreement.  All I wanted to do was to play a damn song!  This also happens with the VIDEO app as well.  WP 8.1 also is missing some very obvious applications and utilities that are included in other phone operating systems.  No world clock?  No stopwatch?  No timer?  POP email support is also very limited.  Also, be very careful when downloading apps from the store.  Most are very misleading and are not from the actual owners.<br/><br/>The hardware is also respectable. Again, for the money, it's adequate for most users.  The quad-core CPU is fast and most tasks are quick and responsive.  I've only see a little lag from IE.  (Tip:  Change the IE setting so that you're not using the "mobile" web versions.  Change to the "full" version and the IE performance is much improved.)<br/><br/>The screen is nothing special but decent for the price.  Video playback is good and reasonable fast.  The physical buttons are good and seem tough enough to take daily abuse.  The speaker is actually on the back of the phone and sounds even louder when placed on a hard surface.  You can cover this speaker hole with your finger for some interesting sound effects.<br/><br/>The phone can accept up to a 128gb MicroSD card but I haven't confirmed this actually works.  I'm using a 32gb Sandisk and it works fine.  You can store just about everything on the MicroSD if you wish.  (Some apps force you to install to phone memory.)<br/><br/>WARNING:  The MicroSIM slot is very touchy.  Be especially careful if you plan to use a SIM converter with your NanoSIM.  Due to gravity, the NanoSIM wants to fall out of the converter prior to getting into the MicroSIM slot.  If the converter gets into the slot without the NanoSIM, then the contacts will get pulled off by the converter.  If you have a MicroSIM then this isn't an issue.  I had to use a small screwdriver to guide the converter and the NanoSIM together into the slot.<br/><br/>This phone works fine as a general smartphone.  I can get my email and still communicate with friends.  The hardware can keep up and is sufficient for daily tasks; however, the lack of quality apps really hurts the user experience.  (A lot of companies produce apps for iOS, Android and even Blackberry.  So you have to ask yourself, why not WP? Hmmm...)<br/><br/>Minor note:  This is my first Nokia smartphone and the primary speaker is closer to the edge than other phones.  I've used all kinds of smartphones but the Lumia 635 seems to have it closer to the top edge.  It's a little awkward at first.  I find myself having to orient my ear just right when receiving a call.<br/><br/>It's hard to beat the price tag since this is just a temporary device.<br/><br/>My final rating on this phone is 3.5/5.  I'm taking a half point off for the lack of an included Micro-USB cable.  The fast charger is nice but can't include a $0.50 cable?  Please!
This is the worst phone I've ever had the misfortune of having. It is slow, the picture quality could not be worse and the overall layout absolutely sucks.
good afternoon I wonder if this phone would work well for telephony in Venezuela, thank you very much
My phone fell off the end table, shattering the screen. Boy, was I discouraged!
I bought 2 of these, breaking the second as quick as the first. The back cover to place the battery, sim and at&t; card is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to remove. I cracked the inside of the screens on both doing so. Now we move to the operating system. In true Microsoft fashion, none of the useful software works unless you give them permission to collect personal information including who your texting with, where you are when you do, and exactly what you are saying, storing and using it as "they" please. ( this applies to most every function usage on the phone ). I highly recommend reading and understanding COMPLETELY http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/legal/wp8/windows-phone-privacy-statement before purchasing. Without agreeing to allowing Microsoft to record and collect this information this is nothing more than a some what useful texting device. No wonder I normally refuse to use Microsoft products, thought I' d give it a chance, what a disappointment as usual.
Not such a great phone even for the price. It constantly freezes if I'm trying to watch a video. The entire screen will start flashing and go black. It closes apps all the time. The materials are crap. Managed to get a huge chip (actual chip of glass fell out of the screen) because I put it in my pocket. That was awesome...less that 12 hours of owning it and it fell apart. Now the entire screen is completely shattered because the mystery chip compromised the glass. Replacing my screen would cost $20....half the cost of the phone. Not worth is for this piece of poop.
I bought this cellphone at WalMart on sale there for $109. I have been regretting it ever since!! This cell drops apps and calls like crazy, YouTube won't play on it, and the touch screen key pad is glitchy. When on a site it will boot you back to your home screen unexpectedly. I hate this cellphone so much I refuse to buy from Nokia again!!! And since WalMart sold at $50 more than Amazon I refuse to buy anything other than this from them again!!!
Let's see. Where should I begin. For one, you can't upload to YouTube. Two, it closes me out of crap whenever I am in the middle of something. I have to remove the battery like every 3 hours just so I can watch YouTube. And worst of all, I CAN NOT DOWNLOAD ANYTHING! So if you want a serious head ache than this is the phone for you.
Anyone who is used to using an Android phone will likely not be happy with this phone.  I re-sold it within a few days of receipt.  Not user friendly, nor is their anything intuitive about it.  I do not recommend a Windows cell phone.
Even the simplest task this junk they call a phone gives you trouble doing.it constantly does not want to open links or pages. Has trouble doing simple things on facebook or practically anything for that matter
Haven't been able to get the back off. Most poorly designed phone I have bought and I have owned phones from LG, Kyocera, Nokia, and ZTE. The GoPhone packaging is slightly less impenetrable.
This piece of crap came without a sim card.
Horrible. Not pleased at all.
Bought this for my daughter, its been nothing but a headache. It has glitches and shuts down. She get only half of her messages. Didn't have these problems with her old smartphone.
I bought this phone as a temporary replacement for a dead iPhone. It is easy to use, has a nice size screen, and the price is hard to beat. I would definitely recommend it to Android enthusiasts, or anyone who, like me, is dissatisfied with the iPhone's less-than-stellar reliability (especially considering the iPhone's steep price tag.).
When I first received the phone I knew this purchase was a bad idea. The phone is horrible in every aspect of it's existence. Do yourself a favor and run from this phone....very fast,and very far!!!!
U like it.
my daughter accidently bought this and we don't have a printer so I kept it no front camera hard to look at facebook
Build of the phone is very poor and is a plastic piece and like a toy phone. On the software front, the OS is a bit slow and lack of apps (which might change in the days to come) is a concern.
NO PLAYSTORE
nothing close to advertisement or hype .....returned mine
I needed a replacement phone since my iPhone 4s had seen better days. I wanted something affordable that also had a good camera, since I am constantly taking pics and videos of the kids. This fits the bill for that.<br/><br/>Pros : Easy interface, decent camera (better than my iphone 4s), good sound quality<br/>Cons : Battery life is not great when you have it set to high performance. I have absolutely nothing good to say about Windows App Store. It's a Mish Mash of horrible apps on top of horrible apps. I'm a 30 yr old SAHM (not exactly tech savvy), but seriously, it's ridiculous. Even the most standard of apps are poor quality. I frequently use Facebook, Instagram (generic), Pinterest (generic), Track Runner, and Gym Radio on a regular basis. That's it. I had 6-8 screens of awesome apps on my iphone for me and the kids....not on Windows. Everything is apple, android, and amazon is starting to show up (No Windows). Sorry for the rant, but it really is THAT bad. You just expect more from Windows....at least I did.
The phone hardware is fine (although it is missing many features, that is to be expected at the price). The windows phone software itself is also fine. The problem lies with the Microsoft Store and the Microsoft MyFamily software. Trying to add a child to your family so that they can load child friendly apps from the microsoft store appears to be impossible. Not only am I unable to complete this task, but when I search online I find others also asking for help with this problem and NO solutions offered by anyone. If you were considering making use of the microsoft app store or myFamily, perhaps you had better wait a while until they get it working. I am looking in to returning this phone even if I have to pay a restocking fee. This is very disappointing.
haven't had a chance to use the phone.<br/>Got it to replace my current phone but when I discovered it used a smaller SIM card, I can't use this phone...which is a bummer.<br/>So now I have give it away; luckily a friend's bday is coming up.
with volume on 10 you can't hear it ring outdoors
This is the weirdest version of Android I have ever used before. I know that every company in the world likes to make their kinda version of Android and stuff, but like this is totally different than my Samsung or my other Android device by a company I can't remember. But yeah, it was really cheap and stuff but I was totally crestfallen to find out that like it doesn't have a front facing camera. what the hell, right??!!??!!?!?!?!?!?! Like no selfies is bad for business duh.
I'm a disabled person living on a limited budget. I bought the least expensive mobile phone I could find. Well, you get what you pay for. Generally speaking I hate it when other people say "Everyone needs more money". Everyone may WANT more money, but not everyone NEEDS more money. Since I'm disabled, I have to buy everything over the Internet. My recommendation is that you buy electronics from a brick and mortar store.
Phone description indicates the phone is unlocked - NO CONTRACT and the phone came LOCKED!  NOT PLEASED!<br/>NEED UNLOCK CODE.
Not good as expected.
good
I am unsatisfied and disappointed. The Phone came locked and I havent being able to use it.
I only posted a 3 star rating because I didn't get to use it. It looks like it would be heavy duty for a no contract phone, it would no doubt deliver the basic necessities, but nothing to write home about.
Phone screen went out when I dropped it
Wasn't compatible with my cell-phone.
it is great
I purchased this phone because I was looking for a low-cost feature rich replacement for an iPod Touch I lost over the summer.<br/>For the price I thought I struck gold. Instead all I have is iron pyrite (fools gold).<br/><br/>Currently, the device DOES NOT BY DEFAULT encrypt data stored on the phone, nor is there any way to turn it on as a standard consumer. The only way to turn this on is via a mobile device management solution used generally in large corporations. As a consumer device, this is an unacceptable state to me. Especially since Apple and Android equipment does, or has the ability to do it with very little hassle.<br/><br/>There is no excuse for this. I hope it will be addressed in an update to Windows Phone 8.1, or the next release of the Windows Phone OS.<br/>If not, this unit is going to be quickly demoted to strictly a GPS device, and the next time I purchase a device I'll spend the extra cash on an Apple product.<br/><br/>I liked the following...<br/>- The built-in radio.<br/>- The decent GPS capability.<br/>- The Micro-SD expansion.<br/>- The ability to play multiple file formats.<br/>- The ability to neuter the cell phone capability to turn it into a basic multimedia device.<br/><br/>I HATED the following...<br/>- Lack of ENCRYPTING all files both in the built-in memory, or any added Micro-SD Flash by DEFAULT.<br/>- Lack of SELF-DESTRUCTING ability in the event passwords are guessed wrong multiple times. (Again, APPLE devices can do this.)<br/>- Hiding the lack of encryption behind marketing and asterisks in the product documentation.<br/><br/>The phone is cheap, and I'm sure will serve many well.<br/>I hope those people don't put anything important on it.
not user friendly. I am not a fan of the windows platform phone. I can not wait till my contract is up because I am ready to get a new phone.
This phone really is not to be carried AT ALL without a case or a cover for the glass. I dropped it the first time and shattered the screen, it still worked but was getting glass slivers in my thumb. The second time I accidentally dropped it..it was ringing but I couldn't see anything nor could I answer it. I'll take my iPhone's over any other phone anyday!!! This phone really sucks in my book.
My Lumia is slooooowwww and windows phone OS does not have a lot a apps. almost every app is made for android or Iphone. Don't waste you money!
Phone is just...garabge.  I  jumped the shark  and bought it, because  all of the good spec OEMs seem to have a trade embargo or somthing going on.  otherwise.  Don't bother with this phone.  Pinch to zoom locks up, forcing you to reboot the phone.  No Flash.  So  basicly forget about ever using the camera.  It claim to have a top quality nokia camera.  take a picture in anything less than Noon sun and you will be greated by  muddy pictures.  the video recording  is atrocious.  Like  cheap android phone levels of bad. constant static/feedback  on the audio.<br/><br/>If you have a 520 ect, just update your phone with windows phone 8.1.  Those old devices top this one by a large margin.  If you are new and want to experience windows phone altogether.  This also isn't the phone for you...  wait a while till the actual good devices and OEMs start releasing.
IT HAS S***TY QUALITY EVEN IT'S NOKIA!!!! The screen is  broken when I had it for two days. Never trust Nokia again.
No coating on glass every fingerprint shows makes phone look disgusting
