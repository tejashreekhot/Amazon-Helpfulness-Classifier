I got the book this morning, and as I was hobbled by pain from an ACL surgery and unable to take painkillers because they would make me loopy at work, instead I read this all day. (Shhhhh. It is okay. I also helped customers.)<br/><br/>There are a million things I love about this book, but I can start with the fact that each chapter is printed on different-colored pages than the ones on either side of it, which makes the book look like a rainbow when it is closed. A RAINBOW, GUYS.<br/><br/>The Depression chapters (previously published on her blog) are revelations to those who have experienced depression and touchstones of understanding for those who have not. The Dog chapters are hilarious to both dog-lovers and cat-lovers (AKA dog haters). The chapters that peek into her childhood make me wish I remembered anything about my life before I was twelve. But you know what? I'm going to take a page from this book, and just imagine that my childhood was just as fantastical, wild, revelatory, unintentionally hilarious, and unique.<br/><br/>Yes, there are a few chapters that are repeats from the blog. Sadly, the fish incident did not make it... that one is still my favorite. But the ones that did make it are definitely worth the re-read. Also, the majority of the book is new material, including some introspective chapters ("Thoughts and Feelings" and the two-part "Identity" chapters). Those, to me, were the best ones of the whole book. I love that the author is so freaking honest (can you swear on Amazon? Imma go with no) about EVERYTHING. She holds this mirror up to her guiding principles and then picks everything apart until she's left with this uncivilized and selfish husk, which she then covers up in a sparkly jumpsuit to make it all better. WHICH IS SOMETHING WE ALL DO. We're all basically uncivilized and selfish. But this author has the guts to admit it.<br/><br/>YOU ARE BRAVE, ALLIE. YOU ARE.<br/><br/>I feel strangely proud of the author for producing this book. Proud like a father, even though she is no relation to me and I have never really met her. I want to give her all the gold stars possible. If there were more than five available for this review, I would have gone with more than five. All the way up to eleventy.<br/><br/>Buy this book. Read it. Go read the blog. Re-read everything. Then buy the book for your friends.
I've been a fan of Allie Brosh's (Allie? Can I call her Allie? Is that weird?) blog for years now, so I was never not buying her book. Her blog is less a series of wordy posts about what happened that day and more comic strip about fish murders, spiders, spaghatta nadles, and the single strangest childhood since Drew Barrymore's.<br/><br/>Her book? It's an offline edition of her blog. So in other words, it's just about perfect. Some new...chapters? Posts? What do you even call these? Anyway, parts of the book are new, others are from the blog, all put together in something approaching a coherent narrative. I'm not terribly upset about blog posts being included in the book. It wouldn't make sense without some of them, and some others are just so good and so well-known that to leave them out would make the book incomplete.<br/><br/>It's much bigger than I had expected, containing a good eighteen chapterposts from 10 to 50 pages long each, but that doesn't matter because you'll read the whole thing in one sitting if you're not a communist. The first chapter alone has swearing at a two-year-old, time travel, and nudity of the most gratuitous sort. In that order.<br/><br/>The thing about this book (and Allie's blog) is...beyond the laughs, she's actually really good. Her two posts on what depression is like (both included here) are the best explanations I've ever seen. And what look initially like simple stick figure drawings are actually surprisingly detailed illustrations that convey a full range of emotion. The art is good, the stories are fantastic, and her telling of them is what makes it all work. Most importantly of all, the cover is a pleasing shade of yellow.<br/><br/>Buy a copy for yourself. Buy one for the office, one for the house, one to keep in the gentleman's closet, one for your neighbors, one for everyone you know for Christmas. You'll like it, they'll like it, it'll class up both your workplace and your toilet.
The majority of negative reviews seem to come from these camps:<br/><br/>1. There's not enough all-new, previously unpublished content<br/>2. The new content that is there isn't as funny as the original blog<br/>3. I don't like the graphic novel-ish format and prefer reading online<br/>4. The book contains too many F-bombs for my taste<br/><br/>... to which I counter:<br/><br/>If you are already a fan of Allie's previous work, support her by buying her book. Regardless of the ratio of new vs republished work, by investing in the book, you can forever own a piece of Allie's work and hold it in your hands, and share it with others in the physical world in a more permanent and tangible way than pushing a button to just send them yet another link. Not to mention that it's the right thing to do. Invest a little coin to support a struggling artist who has been brave enough to bare her soul and gracious enough to previously share her work for free. By buying her book, you send the author a vote of confidence and tell her that her work has value.<br/><br/>If you are not already familiar with Allie's work, read the "Best of" section of the Hyperbole and a Half blog first. Then understand that since that blog was written, the author has been openly struggling with debilitating depression and her new work comes from a much darker place. Given that, the raw language and journey into the abyss in her newer pieces may not be your cup of tea. And that's okay. Simply move along, then, nothing more to see here.
I just got this book this morning via kindle. I thought I'd take a quick peek via the website at what I bought (holding off on immediately opening things I bought, recieved or otherwise obtained is NOT one of my strong points. I would make a very shitty postman). Of course, a few hours later, here I am at work, having done nothing of the list of things that have been overdue since last week, and still very happy I spent my morning this way.<br/><br/>There's a fair few bits of the blog coming back (although it's mostly the ones I was happy to re-read due to either being so brainnumbingly good I just delighted in them, or one of the few bits I haven't re-read a million times already), but a substantial part of the book is entirely new stuff.<br/><br/>And the new stuff is GOOOOOD. If you, like any reasonable person (and quite a few certifiable people) loved her insights on depression and the problems arising when little boys and/or girls get mistaken for grown-ups just because they've been around on this earth for a few decades, you'll love her new stuff. Her ruthless disection of the many ways in which her ideal of herself is not anywhere near the person she is, is something we can all relate to.<br/><br/>And if you don't struggle for breath from laughter at the dog Q&A;, I don't know what to tell you, except that you might be even more horrible of a person than Allie is.<br/><br/>So, to finish off: one question for the author. From my stupid cat.<br/>Q: Srsly, why never bees?
Allie Brosh's pinpointed humor, childish yet not-quite-childish anecdotes, and incredibly self-realized life stories at her cherished blog, Hyperbole and a Half, are what made her an internet icon. You either have never heard of her, or worship the ground upon she walks. There is no in-between.<br/><br/>For the first time, her illustrated memoir essays are bound, and this print volume features not only eight of her most popular and most affecting blog entries, but also ten brand-new original pieces that will remind you of why you fell in love with her blog in the first place—or if you're unfamiliar with it, just how much you've been missing out.<br/><br/>Hyperbole and a Half is so well known for its bizarrely hilarious cartoons; as exemplified in the infamous "CLEAN ALL THE THINGS!" meme, her essays are accompanied by intentionally rudimentary Paint (et al.) illustrations that bring her personality and wit to life. Some daft early readers commented "I could draw way better than you!" on her posts, and well, that's the point. (Those readers didn't last very long).<br/><br/>Brosh's short memoirs are so special because they are highly conscientious, highly exaggerated (hence the hyperbole part), and perfectly capture the essence of identity and self-acceptance. I find it magical how she manages to be sentimental without being corny, intellectual without being standoffish, and comical without being snarky. She covers nostalgic topics like the mishaps of childhood, edgy topics like chronic depression, and downright entertaining topics like the weird and lovable beasts that are dogs. I swear to you: THERE ARE SO MANY DOGS IN THIS BOOK. If you have dogs, this is a must-read for a good laugh. If you have ever struggled with depression or self-doubt, this is a must-read for harsher realities and a sliver ever-burning hope. If you had a childhood, this is a must-read because—don't even lie to me: everyone was a child once. This book—and blog!—is simply a must-read, no excuses.<br/><br/>Pros: Some of my favorite essays from the blog selected // New content is fresh and original; did not disappoint  // Dorky, strange, hilarious // Spunky and kooky; makes you want to be Allie's BFF // Appropriate for all ages // Still manages to be deeply meaningful and substantial<br/><br/>Cons: Not enough stories! I want MORE<br/><br/>Verdict: This blog-inspired collection of full-color-illustrated memoirs—ranging from lifetime reflections to random observant wisps of humor—is guaranteed to fill you with nostalgia, cripple you with laughter, and become your next internet obsession. An adult graphic novel that would just as easily please preteens, Hyperbole and a Half: Unfortunate Situations, Flawed Coping Mechanisms, Mayhem, and Other Things That Happened is entertaining, wacky, and at times, even somber—and this attitude of not taking things too seriously, yet still being sincere, makes it that much more of an extraordinary experience. Brosh's intelligent but self-deprecating humor will charm you and disarm you. This is a book to be read over and over again.<br/><br/>Rating: 10 out of 10 hearts (5 stars): I'm speechless; this book is an extraordinarily amazingly wonderfully fantastically marvelous masterpiece. Drop everything and go buy yourself a copy now!<br/><br/>Source: Complimentary copy provided by publisher in exchange for an honest and unbiased review (thank you, Simon & Schuster!).
The author is such a talent, and it was more sad than enjoyable to read story after story of her beating herself up for being a supposedly awful person. Her 'Depression Pt 1' and 'Depression Pt 2' were beautifully heartbreaking honest descriptions of suffering with depression. But her stories 'Motivation', 'Thoughts and Feelings', 'Identity Pt 1' and 'Identity Pt 2' felt less like fully realized stories and more like circular self-flagellation that left me shifting uncomfortably in my seat. The exuberance and joy that came along with such stories like 'The God of Cake' and 'The Party' were gone - these new stories were the stories of a human being in pain. I know that Allie is getting help, and I hope it will help her realize that she is certainly not as terrible as she seems to believe.<br/><br/>I have trouble scoring my review because I don't think her book should be downmarked for writing about pain. I'd really give this a 3.5 if that were possible. But I do think that the stories above were pretty aimless, and the new ones that were full stories, like 'Lost in the Woods' were not as funny as some of the classics that had me rolling in laughter. However, some of the new stories were great, like 'The Helper Dog is an...' and really, anything to do with her dogs.<br/><br/>I'm happy to support this author, and I hope that she will continue to make strides in her recovery from depression. I'm sure I would buy another book from her in the future.
I've been counting down the days for this book to arrive on my Kindle (I pre-ordered it a few months ago).  I was going to try to have some self restraint and wait for tonight, but I could not resist!! If you don't know anything about Allie Brosh or "Hyperbole and a Half," please go check out her blog. I would honestly be shocked if you do not come back here and buy her book after reading a few of her posts like "Sneaky Hate Spiral" and "This is Why I'll Never Be an Adult".<br/><br/>Allie Brosh is smart, honest, and more often than not, hysterically funny.  She honestly shares her childhood memories and has an incredible way of even recalling her childhood rationale.  She writes in a way that makes you feel like she is your best friend regaling her tales of childhood and her extraordinarily, ordinary life events.<br/><br/>This book is amazing! Allie included a few stories for her blog, but a lot of new stuff.  She definitely makes up for not posting for a while.<br/><br/>Thank you, Allie for writing a book!  If you happen to read this review (highly unlikely, I'm sure), I really wish we could be friends! Please take that in the most un-creepy way possible! :)
I know I’m not the only person in my age range that doesn’t much care for the stereotypes that go along with being a “millennial”.  On one hand, we’ve adopted a guttersnake economy, we’re overmedicated, and we’re being told two converging messages: one of “leaving your campsite cleaner than when you found it” and the other of “a man’s gotta do what a man’s gotta do”.  On the other hand, our inability to feed ourselves and our families on minimum wage has been construed as “lazy”, we’re often *under*medicated, and our one refuge of the internet is filled with some many converging ideas that it’s a wonder we leave our dirty apartments at all.<br/><br/>To me, Allie Brosh has done a better job than just about anyone of expressing the fear, frustration, and just plain rampant silliness of being a millennial.  This might sound overblown to those with only a passing understanding of her work (indeed–even bona fide fans might think I’m reading too much into this).  Brosh’s “Hyperbole and a Half” collects several of the essays from her blog of the same name, and even tosses in some new ones.  The stories are accented by Brosh’s child-like (yet completely compelling and hilarious) doodles.  The essay topics vary greatly, from low self esteem to raising insane dogs to childhood to clinical depression.<br/><br/>And that is where Brosh’s collection goes from insanely clever and charming picture book to millennial mini-manifesto (hereafter referred to as an “MMM”).  In an age where “why can’t you just be happy?” is seen as a valid request of someone who has been discouraged to talk about his or her mental illness their entire life, Brosh makes the explanation of her own depression just that: an explanation.  She makes everything clear–especially the aspects of it that make just as little sense to her as anyone else.  And she does all of this while being charming, witty, and incredibly relatable.  While these stories are certainly in the minority compared to the rest of the book, they leave the most lasting impression.<br/><br/>Beyond these moments, however, Brosh is just plain laugh out loud funny.  Her comics complement the stories perfectly, and never feel tacked on or superfluous.  Her story of being attacked by a goose is a particularly terrific example of this, and she even includes stills from a video she made of the event, lest we think she was just making the entire event up.<br/><br/>If I had anything to complain about, it’s merely that this book is so short.  The entirety of it can be read in an afternoon, and it’s just so good that you can’t help but hop onto your computer and browse her blog for more goodness (which may have been her evil genius plan in the first place).  Brevity aside–this is a fun book.  I think that Ms. Brosh is a talented wit and an introspective young lady, and I really look forward to seeing what else she comes up with down the line.
First of all, I have to say that I actually did purchase this book. Also, it is excellently color-coded.<br/><br/>OK so here's the thing. This book is a magic packet of glee-generating mushy madness. I love it almost as much as it loves me. When I walk around on the streets carrying it, people will randomly come up to me, look at the book, and start to giggle. Sometimes it happens in big crowds, especially when I am on the subway. I think I have actually begun to suffer from some hearing loss as a result of all of the spontaneous snickering, chuckling, crying with laughter, and farting in terror that occurs around me when I carry this book. I have three cats. I have gotten into the habit of moving this book to a high place that the cats cannot reach because its pages function as some kind of strange super catnip madness. Even my cats can tell, at 50 yards, that there is some cracktacular yummies in there.<br/><br/>I have also found that the jacket of the book is capable of functioning as a ward against evil. Recently, a local policeman who usually tickets me for my tendency to walk around with a stuffed alot made a vampire-like hissing noise and ran away when I held this book out in front of me. It even exudes a luxurious and pleasing odor that wards off the smell of pee from my three cats. I left it on top of the washer at the laundromat and not only did my clothes come out smelling better, they were cleaner as well. If this book were a beautiful woman, and I were not already married, I would marry it.<br/><br/>Finally, you should buy this book because its author is awesome. The core of her life seeps from this book like the sap from a maple tree being tapped for syrup. And she has already boiled her ideas so much that all that is left is the maple flavored essence. Also, it is yellow.
I loved seeing some of my favorite posts in here, but her new material was even better. She talks a lot about the stuff people don't like to talk about or even think about; the chapters on identity really hit home and I found myself more than once saying "Oh my god, I do the same things and now I'll never be able to ignore them again!" But it was also comforting. And ridiculously funny. Love this book!
Bringing her internet blog musings to paper offering interesting insights to many usually mundane topics, Allie Brosh will choke you to death with your own laughter by the time you turn the last page. Staying true to what the blog is all about, Hyperbole and a Half: Unfortunate Situations, Flawed Coping Mechanisms, Mayhem, and Other Things That Happened  is a funny, jaw-breaking and completely original stuff as only she can deliver.<br/><br/>Containing some of the classics like the dental visit and the birthday cake, Hyperbole and a Half is deeply insightful, witty and full of wisdom written not with the mind of a scholar but a person who everyone can relate to and understand.<br/><br/>Though many of her blog posts have been repeated, she has been careful and selective enough to pick the choicest materials which one would love to read them again. And reading on paper makes it more fun and easy to understand. Though intended to be funny and witty, her essays about life with all its encumbrances are sometimes agonizingly true and soul-stirring.<br/><br/>I love all things in the book, particularly Dogs Don't Understand Basic Concepts Like Moving, The Goose Story (Dinosaur), This Is Why I'll Never Be An Adult, The God of Cake, Depression, Motivation and The Simple Dog.<br/><br/>And I know you'll love it too! Mind you, you won't stop reading until you stop to laugh. It's a wonderful book no one would want to miss.
What Allie does is surprising. She somehow combines being naive and deeply rational, taking anything we take for granted, and tearing it apart to see what's inside. She's always like a child looking at something for the first time. The results are hilarious and heartbreaking. Like an acrobat, pulling dangerous tricks with her mind, she goes to places we would be afraid to go, all for the sake of our entertainment. There is brutal sincerity, brutal analysis, and a very accurate description of what it's like to be pseudo-intelligent and supposedly self-aware animals crawling planet Earth. (SPOILER!!!!!: Are we really any different from Simple Dog? And isn't she much happier?)
I liked this book, I really did. I never heard of Allie Brosh before i bought this book. Some parts were laugh out loud funny while others were not. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good, quick read. I read it in a day. For you kindle owners out there I do recommend purchasing the actual book ( I made this mistake), there are so many drawings that it was difficult for me to read some of them because they were on the kindle.
I love hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com and would buy this book again to support the site. However, I refer back to the website rather than this paper copy as the flow, which is so natural in a scroll down environment, is broken up in the book by page size constraints.
Oh my Gosh I absolutely LOVE this book and wish she had made it longer. The stories are hilarious. The pictures hysterical. I love her warped and twisted sense of humor! Can I add all the extra stars here? If you like her blog, you'll love her book! More More More!
When I first discovered Allie Brosh's blog I read every single entry over two evenings. I would have stayed up all night and read it one sitting, but I wore myself out laughing. Her cartoon stories are hilarious in the strangest way. You start to read, get hooked, and then find yourself weeping with laughter sputtering something like, "Kenny Loggins!" or "wolves!"This book includes her best stories, but it goes way beyond, exploring her relationship with her family and fiancé and her experiences with depression and self-doubt. I hope Allie Brosh keeps blogging, keeps writing, and keeps making sense out of the ridiculous.
Everyone needs to read this book. It is full of awesome and 100% approved by my very own Simple Dog. Allie's work is amazing and hilarious. I would buy anything she writes!
I've been a huge fan of hyperbole and a half for years and she has always been a fantastic writer not because she is writing fictional masterpieces but because she is letting her readers in on her mind and in a lot of ways ourselves. She lets us laugh at our own craziness by talking about her craziness. I've struggled with depression most of my life and her posts about depression, which are both in this book as well, are some of the best descriptions of what depression feels like, a hard concept to explain to people who have never gone through it.<br/><br/>The book itself is gorgeous and much bigger than i expected, thick glossy pages that really let the stories and art pop. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is either a fan already or a complete newcomer to allie's work.
Subject is not a typo or spelling error. Regular readers of Hyperbole and a half will understand.<br/>I Laughed Till I Cried.<br/><br/>The Binding seems a bit weak but the content is great.<br/><br/>Thanks Allie!
Allie's illustrations have got to be the funniest thing I have ever seen, and her writing will have you rolling on the floor. If you don't like this book you probably don't have a soul.
If you've never read Hyperbole and a Half, you should...and even if -- maybe especially if -- you have, you should definitely buy this book...Allie Brosh is perhaps the most honest person you'll ever encounter, and she's damn funny...and poignant at the same time.<br/><br/>There are *very* few people who can be legitimately self-effacing and honest at the same time, and Allie is clearly such a person. I'm guessing that this book was terrifically difficult to write and that it caused a lot of second-guessing about what to leave in and what to take out...what's here is a very real, very brave, and yet also somehow seems meant to be.<br/><br/>I can tell you this: you won't find another book like this unless and until she writes another one...all the best to you, Allie -- you've clearly faced down a lot (yes, pun intended for fans of the blog) to see this through to fruition, and I sincerely wish you many more years of success as an author and dog, er, whisperer ;-)
Allie's cartoon about depression is both pithier and more eloquent than anything by David Foster Wallace. I don't know if it's because she more depressed than he was, or just smarter. Her honesty is humbling.<br/><br/>Her cartoons are SO great. It's more important just to say that than to say it cleverly. My friends and I were dancing with glee when we found out she had a book coming out.<br/><br/>Allie is one of those people who are so funny, and so real, that I would actually rather she was just happy than for her to keep writing (although I would be pretty freaking grateful if she kept writing). And she can draw dogs with a track pad. A TRACK PAD!!
I first discovered across the author's blog, "Hyperbole and a Half," when a friend linked me to one of her stories.  I was almost instantly hooked -- Allie Brosh had a wicked sense of humor and a knack for milking the most humor out of whatever situations she found herself in, whether it was a recent occurrence or a tale from her childhood.  I found myself laughing until I cried, and thanking the heavens above that there was someone out there whose childhood and life were just as weird as mine.  I'm rather sad that her blog has gone awhile without being updated, but given that Brosh has recently suffered a severe bout of depression, I believe her getting a handle on her mental health takes precedence over my entertainment.<br/><br/>Under most circumstances I rarely feel that purchasing a book containing material compiled from the Internet is worth my money -- why pay for something I can get online for free?  But in this case I'm willing to make an exception.  Not only because there's plenty of new material in here that can't be found on the "Hyperbole and a Half" website, but because I want to support a witty and insightful author.<br/><br/>Posts from Allie Brosh's website make up about half of the content of this book, and so it can be considered something of a "Best Of..." collection.  "The God of Cake," "The Party," "The Simple Dog" (previously simply titled "Dog"), and "Dogs Don't Understand Basic Concepts Like Moving" were previously published on her website, but it's still nice having these stories in a print collection.  "Dinosaur (A Goose Story)" seems to be a rewritten version of a story on her blog, which I still enjoyed because the rewrite makes it all the more hilarious.  And new stories like "Parrot," "Lost In the Woods," "The Hot Sauce Debacle," and "Warning Signs" are just as funny and clever as her blog entries, with brand-new illustrations to match.<br/><br/>Now seems like a good time to mention the illustrations.  They're on the crude side and seem to have been drawn in MS Paint, and Allie draws herself as a sort of "evolved" stick figure with noodle-like arms, a primitive-looking face, and a hairdo that somehow resembles a yellow shark's fin or party hat.  But somehow the simple, scribbly style fits the story far more than professional artwork would have.  The drawings are incredibly expressive, colorful, and fit each story like a glove, perfectly complimenting and adding to the humor.<br/><br/>But Brosh doesn't just share the fun and games with us, and some of her stories are genuinely heartbreaking.  She shares some deeply personal stuff with us, including her already-famous "Depression Part 1 and 2," where she gives a surprisingly detailed and honest description of what it's like to suffer clinical depression.  Many have already identified with her struggles and despair online, and now that the book is in print her frank analysis of the condition is likely to reach a much wider audience.<br/><br/>New to this book are "Motivation," "This Is Why I'll Never Be An Adult," and "Identity Part 1 and 2."  In these essays she's a lot harder on herself, and she takes a risk by revealing some of her personal flaws and secret fears regarding who she is.  But I found myself identifying with a lot of what she shares, and coming to the stark realization that I'm not the only one who's experienced some of the same things she shares.  Brosh has not only shared something very personal with the world, she has touched on some of the things we all feel, but don't dare share.<br/><br/>"Hyperbole and a Half" is part wickedly funny memoir, part observational humor, and part deeply moving personal reflection.  It's by turns funny and heartbreaking, and is well worth reading.  Highly recommended (but warning for some swearing).
The genius of Allie Brosh is that she makes you feel like she's inside your head. Or that she's your best friend. She's remarkably good at expressing her feelings on seemingly trivial topics that others have overlooked-- her material isn't stuff that's been done to death, but the smaller things that we don't usually talk about... like how you get halfway across a grocery store, decide you DON'T want those canned mushrooms after all, and then have a fight inside your head about what you're going to do with those mushrooms. Put them back randomly wherever you are, get a little closer to the canned mushroom section...?<br/><br/>The funny thing is that I tore open this package, saw the cover, and immediately sat down on my stairs and smiled, looking at it as if I were about to read a friend's book, and I was so proud of her for getting it published. Then I remembered that Allie Brosh has no idea who I am. She's my secret friend. So secret that she doesn't know it yet.<br/><br/>She expresses things that are apparently very common human emotions and tendencies that we don't talk about, and she does it with these primitive cartoons and really funny commentary. She's so beloved that she disappeared for a year and no one forgot about her... how often does that happen?<br/><br/>To be honest, I wasn't thrilled with the format choice for the book. I thought it should have been a wider/larger book, because some of her stuff works better when you can see more frames. I'd even venture to say I preferred reading it online... scrolling rather than turning the pages felt more natural to me, but that might just be habit.<br/><br/>The new material here is just as good as the old material. It's all pretty awesome. And I'm still proud of her.
I first learned about Allie Brosh's blog when a friend posted Depression Pt. 2 on Facebook.  Reading that completely blew me away - how well she captured how it feels to be caught up in depression.  As someone who has been dealing with it for over a decade and a half, it was so comforting to finally have a way to show friends and family what it's like, giving them a means to understand, and also helping me better understand it myself.  And still, somehow, being able to laugh at something so painful, because Brosh added her dark humor to the situation she was describing.<br/><br/>Until this book, that one post was the only thing I'd ever read of Allie Brosh's, so I was delighted at all the entertaining stories it contained.  A lot of these blog-based books tend to feel like a waste of money where you end up spending $20 on twelve pages of old news.  At roughly 400 pages, this one was worth it for the amount of content alone.  Now add in the fact that it's also full color (this might seem minor, but I really enjoyed the fact that each chapter was printed on a different page color, making it more appealing than comics on a plain white page) and you really have a good value.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Allie Brosh's self-deprecating humor, although sometimes it panged me to see how much she really seems to dislike herself.  Still, the stories are honest, and she writes and illustrates things that undoubtedly many of us think and feel but are too self-conscious or scared to admit.  And even with how heart-wrenching some of it was, I still was laughing out loud over and over as I read it!  Thank you, Allie Brosh!
Anyone who has ever read or heard about Allie's blog should immediately buy this book.  The new material is fantastic, and reading the "old" material again was just as entertaining as it was the first time I read it.
Soooo happy to have this book :D<br/><br/>Devoured the contents alternately laughing and crying. Part way through, I realized I was disturbing the toddler with so much laughcry and hid my face in the book for a minute. It was dark in there, and quiet, and moms don't get a lot of privacy so I closed my eyes and accepted the next five minutes for what they were. Book faced. Then finished the book! I was begged to re-read The God of Cake to my six year old several times (only had to edit out one word yay)but this is normal, kids like repetition. Toddlers don't like repetition, they LIVE repetition. An entire story is too long for a toddler, he will allow one page exactly.(spoiler!)Page 346 has circles on it. Circles and triangles! I am not allowed to look at any other page with toddler in room. Book is currently propped up with 346 on display. Because circles and triangles, you guys!<br/><br/>So I read the book, I humored the kids, I had guests over, I ate an avocado --- When do you think I discovered the ink on my forehead that looks like I've been beaten and bruised? shortly after the avocado. Because of the handwashing. I'm not an avocado eating animal over here. The hands must be washed! And there is a mirror above the sink. sigh.<br/><br/>Pro - one page will delight your children for hours!<br/>Con - one teary nap will cause unscrubbable bruises that make your guests feel awkward.
I've been following Allie's blog for years. I waited through her long, long hiatus while she was coping with depression, and I was thrilled when she came back and announced she was publishing a book. I preordered this months ago, and it did not disappoint. It's perfect.<br/><br/>"If it's so perfect, why only four stars?" you ask.<br/><br/>Well, because I'm a selfish, petty person. Intellectually, I love that Allie is so open about her battle with depression. I know there are thousands of people out there who suffer from (or live with or love someone who suffers from) depression, and these people will be educated, uplifted, and comforted by her story. I know that her comics about her struggles are easily the most important stuff she's ever written. I just don't find them as entertaining as her older stuff. That's my fault, not hers.
Very happy I bought the physical book version of this book.  It's a solid heavy thing, that was delivered with my Monsters University BluRay and thus confused the house a bit when the unknown package arrived.<br/><br/>If it was Allie or her publisher who decided to change page colors per story I have no idea, but they are a genius.  It perfectly fits the writing and was the second thing I noticed.  The first thing was wondering about Scott.<br/><br/>Read a few stories last night when I got home from work and really enjoyed it.  Classics, new stuff, and now I have it for ever and ever.  You should buy this book right now.  Go now.  Push the button!
Allie Brosh's Hyperbole and a Half is one of the internet's favorite personal experience blogs.  This book takes some of the greatest hits from her website and combines them with several brand new stories, all illustrated in her signature neo-primitive style and printed on very heavy paper.<br/><br/>That is an attribute not to be ignored.  This is a very heavy book.  As in weight, or mass.  (well, weight is just mass multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity, so it's all related, but you get the idea)  It is one of the best book values in terms the quantity of paper for your budget dollar, therefore I highly recommend it.
I love Allie's blog, so I've been eagerly awaiting this book for awhile.<br/><br/>Then I forgot that it was coming out. It came out. I saw it in the window. I meant to stop in, and then I didn't. Then I forgot again. Then I had trouble motivating myself to leave my house after I already acted (vaguely) like an adult for a while seven or eight hours.<br/><br/>By the time I remembered and stopped in to buy it as consolation for missing my bus, which I knew would make me late to my appointment, she had already had an event at a local bookstore and was gone, along with all the signed copies of her book.<br/><br/>I felt very sad.<br/><br/>Then I read the book and felt vaguely vindicated, because she describes some similar things happening to her. But I still feel a little sad.<br/><br/>The end.<br/><br/>Except now I'm going to order another copy. Or two. I'm not sure who's getting them for Christmas, but someone will, because this is a really amazing book.
I am a long time fan, but that doesn't matter. All that matters is that you read this book and that you read it right away.  And then go read the award-winning blog. And then go read her Gloss articles. And then tell me you've ever read anything more insightful that made you laugh until you cried and back again. And THEN tell me you're not going to quote the part about the vacuum in the parrot chapter to all of your friends, because I totally have.
The absolute funniest book I have ever bought hands down. Allie's funny stories made my ribs burn and eyes flow from laughing. In between are some of the most profound and scathing descriptions of depression and self-examination. Psychology textbooks should print her Depression Pt. 1 and 2 comics so that people who have never experienced real depression can understand what it feels like. Amazing book, well worth the purchase price.
I have been reading Hyperbole and a Half for several years now and I was thrilled when the book came out. It met all of my expectations. I thoroughly enjoyed this. It is quick, funny, thought provoking and all around enjoyable. You cannot go wrong getting this book. On a side note, the kindle version of this book comes out just fine on my iPad all the pictures and text are in the correct place.
It's hilarious.  Book includes a few items from the best of the blog, plus a bunch of fantastic new material.  The single flaw of the entire book is that there isn't more of it.
I love Allie Brosh and this book is a hilarious collection of some of her essays.  However - BIG WARNING HERE - don't buy the Kindle version.  Allie's humor resides primarily in her cartoons.  Unfortunately, they are too small to be read in the Kindle version and cannot be enlarged.  Buy the print.  But enjoy the book!
Originality is hard to come by in a day and age where digital fame is so attainable. But blogger-turned-author, Allie Brosh, has managed the impossible—to stand out in the ever-growing vastness of the internet with her award-winning blog Hyperbole and a Half. I mean, who hasn’t wanted to READ ALL THE THINGS?!<br/><br/>I’ve been a huge fan of the blog for quite some time so I was really excited when I found out she was releasing a book of the same name. I’m usually weary of blog books because many contain a disproportionately large amount recycled content. And while I will admit there are reused posts in Hyperbole and a Half, there is a good balance of old favourites and new material, enough to keep it familiar but still interesting.<br/><br/>I think what makes Brosh so popular is her self-depreciating humour and the blatant honesty behind it. She acknowledges the hard truths alongside the absurd, is completely upfront about her shortcomings and accepts who she is without ever apologizing for it. These are all traits that I really admire and I think it’s what makes her stories so relatable and, in turn, her blog so successful. There’s also a dark wisdom underlying her work, especially with regard to the segment on depression. Being that I am someone who’s struggled with depression in the past, I can especially appreciate what she’s done here. She takes a concept few truly understand and manages to bring some clarity to it. It’s hard for me to explain what she’s with adequate coherency so I urge you to read it for yourself and see.<br/><br/>On top of it all, I can’t forget to mention the accompanying illustrations which are so simplistic in nature that they become effective. These cute yet crude drawings are surprisingly detailed and, even more surprisingly, they’re good. They are good because they are simple. They are simple as to not distract from the overall message. They help to add new layers of meaning and comedy to the story in a way that words otherwise can’t. They are the perfect complement to the directness and the occasional harshness of her storytelling. The combination of Brosh’s pictures and words bring about a whole host of feelings to the reader, from laughter to hope to sympathy and even sometimes sadness. She makes you, the reader, feel things. And isn’t that the point?<br/><br/>Food for Thought: Hyperbole and a Half is one of the very few successful examples of a blog to book transition. The book is poignant, funny, touching, relatable, creative, if not, a little extreme. But that’s exactly why it’s so funny. She’s a natural-born storyteller, a comic genius and an ingénue. Brosh’s cleverness is to be admired, as are her killer MS Paint skills. She will push it to the limit, embrace the absurd and in the end, live to tell another story. This is a book I highly recommend to fans of the blog and new readers alike.
I, like most internet denizens, am a huge fan of the blog Hyperbole and a Half.  The first time someone linked me to one of the entries I thought that Allie Brosh might be stalking me and recording my life, since it hit so very close to home.  When she announced that she had a book coming out, I paid attention.<br/><br/>Now, it's finally here!  Let me tell you: it is worth paying money for.<br/><br/>Many blogs have resulted in a book deal, but sometimes they lose something in the transition to print.  Brosh is as hilarious, authentic, and insightful as ever in her memoir.  Some of the most popular internet pieces are in the book (not "Alot"), often with more material.  But even more of HYPERBOLE AND A HALF is completely new, never-before-seen stuff.  And it is good.  It is staying-up-late-and-waking-up-other-people-with-your-laughter good.<br/><br/>HYPERBOLE AND A HALF isn't perfect.  It helps to be familiar with Brosh's blog, because sometimes things get introduced without much explanation.  For instance, her boyfriend Duncan starts appearing in chapters quite a bit before he gets named.  However, part of Brosh's charm has always been that she isn't too slick, her art well balanced and proportioned yet clearly done with MS Paint.  Another part is her honesty, which was very important when she started writing about depression.<br/><br/>Much of the new material does deal with Brosh's depression (as well as her dogs).  She makes you feel what living with depression with is like, and she does it while making you bust a gut with laughter.  At the same time, there are bits that will tempt the waterworks. particularly if you know someone with or have depression yourself.<br/><br/>If you're wondering why you should buy something you can get for free, then know that there is a ton of new material.  Know that you're supporting Brosh and allowing her to spend more time creating.  If you're unfamiliar with Brosh, then buy this book and be prepared to fall in love.  Then go forth and buy a copy for everyone on your holiday shopping list.  Get two copies for the dog lovers.
Honesty.<br/><br/>That's my one word to describe this incredible piece of work.  Allie Brosh is deeply, deeply honest.  Other people describe her humor as self-deprecating.  That's true, in a sense.  Her stories are about herself either as a bundle-of-neuroses adult or as an even weirder kid.  She criticizes many things about herself here: her depression, her avoiding of responsibility, her procrastination, being a jerk to her mom.  But to me "self-deprecating" describes a different, more timid kind of humor, like slapping yourself in the face.<br/><br/>Allie's humor isn't like slapping herself in the face.  It's more like hacking herself to pieces with an axe and then rolling around in the blood.  She's not just having a laugh at her own expense here, she is actively exploring her deepest fears and insecurities.  But there's this amazing balance too.  Anyone who is so harsh on themselves risks coming off as being bitter and hateful, but Allie always stops just sort of making us really concerned, and just joins us in laughing at this ridiculous person.  This ridiculous person she is, and she might as well love because she's stuck with her.  Just like all of us are stuck with ourselves.<br/><br/>If we could all look at ourselves with such honesty, such scorn, such empathy, and such forgiveness, we would all be blessed.  Just knowing even one person is out there who does is comforting.  But being able to share in it, reading this book, is a treasure.
Wow, I love her blogs and this book was like all of them rolled into one. It was funny and I have reread it several times and still pick up subtle nuances: like the expressions on the faces. I am getting a couple more for Christams gifts.
Now. Best financial decision you will ever make.  Better then the time you paid for your wedding. Child's first bike.  Or anything.  Plus makes for a super easy to figure out gift for that person who has everything and needs a third copy.
Allie Brosh has an amazing sense of humor. The artwork adds so much, i appreciate how her cartoons are so basic and so well done at the same time. The slightest change in diameter of simple dog's pupils makes it that much more funny.
I've been a long-time reader of Allie Brosh's Hyperbole and a Half as a website, so when I heard it was coming out in book form, it was hard to contain my excitement.<br/><br/>Did I vote for it in the Goodreads Readers' Choice Awards? Yes, I did.<br/><br/>Do I think it deserved its win? Yes, I do.<br/><br/>Do I think this is the best book it could have been? No. And here's why:<br/><br/>Brosh has an immense talent at both comedy and pathos, and her hysterically amateurish-looking illustrations add to both.<br/><br/>The book contains approximately 50% new content, as well as some pieces readers of the blog will recognize ("The God of Cake" being a favorite).<br/><br/>What has happened here, however, is--what I assume to be--an editorial process that was meant to make the blog posts somehow more readable to a book audience and instead, flattened them. A favorite post about a goose attack in Brosh's house that had me laughing to the point of hyperventilating when I read it on the blog seems strangely deflated (and I went back and read it on the blog again just to be sure it was the book, and not me. It still had me in stitches as a blog post.)<br/><br/>Other posts, such as the ones focusing on Brosh's struggle with depression, seem to have had some of the illustrations edited out in favor of conversion to text. While that's undoubtedly a financial decision, it siphons off the charm and personality of the dialog Brosh is having with her readers in sharing these thoughts and feelings.<br/><br/>As an introduction to Brosh, it's great, and she is a stunning writer. But for the full impact of Hyperbole and a Half, I suggest you carve out a few hours and hit the website ([...] which gets a 10 out of 5 stars.
Seriously, unless you are dead inside, you will find much enjoyment in this book.<br/>It's funny and silly, but also deeply insightful and honest, which really makes for the best writing.
I received this book as a gift over Christmas and right before that I kept seeing ads and reviews for it in Entertainment Weekly and Publishers Weekly, and more. It's not what you'd expect at all, and that's what makes it fun. It's a book full of pictures - very similar to the images on the front cover. Basically, it's like a comic strip - with more narrative. Sometimes it's writing, other times it's pictures. Both things work together to tell Allie's stories. Her stories of childhood, of her dog, of depression, of sarcasm, etc. These stories -surprising to me- were not all funny, some were sad, some were really real. It was a very open glimpse into the life of Allie, and at that, kind of the life of many 20-somethings and 30-somethings I felt.<br/><br/>I did start this book on the airplane and I was laughing pretty hard - it was a little weird for the guy next to me as he tried to sleep.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this book and I think it's a great gift for the quarter-lifer's in your life.
She made me laugh and cry...sometimes at the same time.  She totally nails how depression feels and the thought processes that you go through when you are depressed but she does it in a way that lets you laugh and come out better for having gone there.  She tells unique stories that are hilarious and totally incredible yet you don't doubt for a second that things happened just the way she tells them.  The drawings are a riot.  My husband and I go to a store now and all we have to say is, "floor-banana-person" and we crack up.  Be warned that there is some bad language but even if you hate the bad words, the book is STILL more than worth the read.  Skip over the words you don't like but you will not regret reading this book.  We bought two copies and gave one to a friend.  If you read this in a public place people will look at you because you will laugh out loud!
Laugh out loud funny(I find many reviews that say that but they are Not).  I don't often write review's but this book has all the things promised.  Allie Brosh has distinctive insight in common everyday situations that set her apart from other so called humour writers.  Her dog stories describe my dogs simplemindedness to a "T". My only disappointment is that she doesn't have a naughty kitty to add another dimension to the crazy antics. Buy this book. You will never regret it. I read it every time I need a laugh. Having gone through years of depressive episodes myself, she explains the "darkness/hopelessness better than any doctor or therapist ever could. Could have given her the thousands of dollars I spent on therapy to write another book. I wish I could know her as a friend. Buy this book!  P.S. Allie your awesome. libbywagner73@yahoo.com.
Allie's a fantastic writer. I bought this in hardcover, even though I rarely purchase books anymore, and I could not be happier for my purchase.<br/><br/>The repeat comics were still amazing to read. The new ones were fantastic. Even as the book got a bit heavier towards the end, it was honest, beautiful, and thoughtful.<br/><br/>Allie, you aren't a s***ty person. You are a truthful, introspective one. You make peoples lives better. You definitely made me think - about you, about your stories, about myself - and you made me laugh.<br/><br/>Read this book. It's awesome.
Thing 1. I never buy paper books anymore. I am 110% into my Nexus and it's e-reader apps.<br/><br/>Thing 2. I bought this book. As much as I love my Nexus, you can't lend e-books to people that don't have e-readers and I plan on lending this book to PLENTY of people because Allie is awesome and amazing and the entire world deserves to be enlightened by her insights.<br/><br/>Thing 3. This book far surpassed what I was hoping it would be and if for some silly reason you're on the fence about buying it you should get off the fence and do it.
Allie Brosh is a hero to all of us who have trouble going outside, answering the phone, or understanding feelings. If you have seen her blog, you know what to expect. The book takes some of her best and most important work and mixes it with some new material. She is an inspiration because she writes from the depths of depression. She hasn't conquered it and may not. She writes while in the trenches, not looking back afterwards. This book made me understand myself better. I tore through the whole thing in a few hours after it was delivered. The people in the apartment next door must think I am crazy because of how hard I was laughing from the very first page. Buy this book so Allie never has to worry about adult responsibilities of going to work again! Also, it will make your life much better.
There were a few tiny ink smudges on the sides of the paper, but no where near enough to dissapoint this customer! The book was in great condition (as it should have been-it was advertised as new) and I couldn't have been happier with it! The hard cover is all white and there was only one tiny smudge on the binding and the corners were a little bent, but not enough to deter my enjoyment-AND it came it half the time I was told it would take! This book lover is satisfied. Worth the extra money for a new hardcover.
Allie Brosh is very funny as always and I've been looking forward to this book for months. It's funny, it's enjoyable, and it's a quick read. My only complaint is that it includes a lot of the material that's already on her blog, which I've already read many times.  The book is a mix of old and new, and given the book is a fast read as it is, the amount of new material goes by way too fast.  I'm glad she published a book and hope it does well, but can't help but feeling a bit disappointed there wasn't more.
She is talented, original, and witty as they come.<br/><br/>And yet, she doesn't produce only surface-guffaws.  The is genuine truth behind them. Sometimes in reading her stories, you just know her zany humor is pouring out through tears, coming from a situation that more painful that playful.  Her stories connect us to her humanity and there is real life in every laugh.<br/><br/>This girl... her talent is taking her places, and I hope her sense of humor gets her through all of life's challenges.
I've been an avid reader of the blog for years and was so excited for this book to come out. When it was finally released, I downloaded it to my kindle, and subsequently read the entire thing in a span of about 2 hours. I was definitely not disappointed! Some parts of this book are from the blog, and I enjoyed reading them again, and some parts were new. Some of these new parts surprised me and I couldn't stop myself from laughing out loud.<br/>This book is great and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who has a sense of humor or enjoys laughing their ass off.<br/>What are you waiting for? Buy it and read it already!
I've been a fan on hyperboleandahalf since 2010 and this book did not disappoint! It is awesome to have so many beloved stories in print at my house. I am oldschool and love books on paper. Yes, this book was about half old stories but they were great stories! I highly recommend this book! I got one for myself and gave one as a gift to someone who sat down and started reading, and giggling, immediately.
Beyond its hilarity, which I knew going into it, H and 1/2 in book form is very well produced. The images are vibrant and enticing, and flipping through the prose is actually quite enjoyable, I dare say more so than the blog. Many many thanks to Allie and her editors that forced her to do this. This book makes an excellent present for anyone with insight and a great sense of humor.
It's been a long time since I've been so involved in a book. I hope she decides to write another book! Loved it.
I love this series.  Very funny, great to read aloud... touching stories and cute drawings.  I was a fan of her blog, and i am a big fan of her book too!
This is an amazing introspective looks by the author  at what makes her who she is, which is not uncommon.  The difference  is than at she has the courage to acknowledge her flaws and share them with her audience.
I was approached in a cafe and asked if everything was okay, because I had made the mistake of reading this in a public place and was red in the face, crying from laughter! Such a wonderful, funny, and oddly insightful and inspirational read!
This book had me in tears laughing more than once.  Author is brilliant and her images capture emotions sooo very well.
I haven't laughed out loud, this hard, this much at a book for some time. Relatable and not so relatable stories, sometimes deep truths told in from a humorous POV. Highly recommend to someone who is looking to be entertained and searching for a memorable, inspiring read.
A very honest, sometimes brutally honest book that really touches you deeply. The existential puzzles, the absurdity of the universe - and THE best description of a deep depression I've ever read. Thank you for your work, Allie! Please, hang in there - there are people who DO think that you are cool even if your fish are dead.<br/><br/>Check it out, have an open mind, and be prepared to laugh and to cry and to reflect.
This book was excellent. And I can't even say why- was it the drawings? Latent sarcasm? Or just my ability to relate to the author. Probably a little ( or a lot) of all the above.
This book is great. It makes me laugh and it also makes me feel like there's someone out there who knows what I'm going through. I have found the voice who has described a lot of my same thoughts and feelings. I know I'm not good at writing and I can never find the right words to describe what I'm going through, but Allie has described it perfectly. I feel like we're twins separated at birth.<br/><br/>Thank you, Allie, for sharing your stories. You are an extremely talented person.
I am a happy panda. Her writing lights up my life.<br/>And I can't even point to an exact reason why. I would want more if it existed already.
Funny as hell and extremely entertaining!!!  I love her work and words. Always a surprise and makes me laugh to tears!!
As soon as I knew the book was out there for me to buy, I had to have it. I have read Allie's stories and adored her drawings for years. If you are a fan of her work, the book does not disappoint. New stories! Yay! She is simply hilarious and makes me want to draw my own weird stories of my own weird life. Love her!!!
I've been excited about this book ever since I started reading the Hyperbole and a Half blog a few years ago. This book contains about a dozen new stories as well as some old ones that are just as enjoyable to read again. If you read it in public, be prepared for people to give you strange looks as you struggle not to laugh out loud.
This book gets a 5 from me because of its realness. I love her inner b.s. detector and her bravery for sharing it with all of us. I have honestly felt all of these things and felt so alone. It is such a relief to know that at least one other person has these bizarre inner monologues of shame. Love you, Allie. You are my hero.
She's funny, she hits things oh, so close to home.  And her drawings are so nuanced despite their simplicity.  I thought I would read this a few stories at a time, especially since I am a follower of her blog.<br/><br/>Nope.<br/><br/>Read the whole book, cover to cover, in one evening.  And laughed so hard I cried.
Allie is a fantastic storyteller who takes us in to the awkward crevices of he life and leaves us in tears from laughing so hard. She also educates us about her struggles and helps us understand the people  we love who suffer from depression. Her drawings are anything but simple. They are full of amazing expression.
Stop reading customer reviews right now and just buy the bool !! its amazing. The goose story had me laughing so hard I couldn't see the page. I was at a coffee shop and the guy beside me went online and ordered a copy while we were sitting there. Buy this book. Do not read while consuming hot beverages. R
Sometimes you fall in love with an awesome blogger, rejoice when you find out they got a book deal, but when you finally get the book, it fails to meet expectations.<br/><br/>Allie Brosh is not one of those people. This book is worth every minute we've waited over the last couple years. It's perfect.
I am a fan of Allie's blog and have read and reread its material numerous times. The book introduces a lot of darker, more introspective stuff, but that's not a bad thing--the honesty is refreshing. She has real talent as a storyteller (and a writer) and I respect what's she done with that talent.
I got this on a whim, browsing for some new books to put on my iPad mini for trips.  I had never heard of Allie Brosh or her blog, but I LOVED THE BOOK!  ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS!!!  I've now read through her entire blog.  I finished her book in 2 days.  I recommend it to anyone who likes to laugh.
Allie is a wonderful author and blogger, everything is hilarious or touching or slightly creepy/weird. This book covers a lot of previous material with some new things and is thicker than expected, but all of it is filled with her unique and amazing outlook and experiences. Highly recommend.
This was a gift requested by my daughter. We both enjoyed reading parts of it. She was delighted to have it for the long flight home. The fast delivery was very important to me because I ordered it one day and it arrived the next in the nick of time for Christmas. Thank you Amazon.
What to say about this book that hasn't already been said by many other reviewers?  I actually forgot I had pre-ordered it and one day it just showed up on my Kindle and Oh! such joy.  I laughed, I cried, I laughed... This book will be a "Go-To" book for gift giving.
If you are a follower of Allie's Blog than this is a must have book.Best yet if you are not a follower then this is a great introduction.  Her stories combined with pictures take me back to my childhood, stuff my kids did and stuff my dogs still do. I recently celebrated my birthday and there was cake left in the kitchen. All I could think of was eating more cake. I tried to explain this to my spouse when I realized all I had to do was read the cake story outloud. We were laughing so hard we almost fell out of bed. Moreso the story of her depression is the best first person account of someone who has suffered an episode of depression that I have ever read. As a mental health professional it has been very helpful in aiding  family members and support personnel to understand what the patient is experiencing.
This book is a hands down 5 star rating due to the quality of the book, the hilarity bestowed, and the incredibly cute and quirky writing.<br/><br/>The book itself is durable and thick, and has a healthy heft to it.  The pages are semi-glossy and high quality.<br/><br/>The content is amazing.  I have been a fan of Allie's writing, and regularly checked her blog for updates and am excited to see that she has turned such a great and wonderful passion into a career.  This book is a great read for anyone who has felt lost in their 20's and 30's, suffered from depression,  owned a slightly odd dog, raised a precocious child, or ever felt awkward will find this book funny and insightful.<br/><br/>I would recommend this book to everyone.  It is heartwarming, heartbreaking, and funny all at the same time.
I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this book by the end. I was a little skeptical... This was a book club selection and not only do I not typically read funny books like this, but I'd never even heard of the blog.<br/><br/>It was hilarious. The illustrations alone made me laugh to the point of tears. And FYI, it's basically all illustrations. They MAKE this book. The raw honesty was beautiful. The way she talks about her true self and her struggles with depression made me nod along and still laugh. It takes a very creative person to be able to bring humor to some of life's most painful experiences.<br/><br/>Overall, it's silly. More of a novelty book, but one I'm really glad I read. It was a nice diversion. I think it would make a nice gift for someone who needs a smile or a light travel read.
I ordered this because I love the Hyperbole and a Half blog and I think Allie's writing is hilarious.  If you have not checked it out then I would recommend doing so before buying the book.<br/><br/>The book has alot of new material and the quality of the printing is excellent.  I ordered the hardcover and cannot comment on the softcover version.  The book is in all color and the paper has a high quality feel with a nice gloss and heavy weight.  The MSRP is 28 for the hard cover and it was a great buy under $20.<br/><br/>This book would make for an excellent gift for a younger person with a good sense of humor.  I really got a kick out of the story about motivation, it is my favorite new story so far.<br/><br/>Now go eat some chocolate chips after you get motivated enough to buy this book.
Ok, I have to admit I haven't finished the book yet. I purchased the book a year ago. It is absolutely NOT what I thought it was. I am an English teacher, and, since it has been a year, I do not remember exactly what I thought when purchasing, or if I even read the blurb, but I do know that I thought it had something to do with English, maybe hyperbole, maybe inspirational teaching ideas, etc. This is not THAT book, if that book even exists. This is a book that made me cry with laughter, commiserate in silence, and nod in agreement. There is a lot in this book that is REAL. If that appeals to you, you will like it. You may even love it. So far I am 3/4 of the way through and I have to say I love the goose story the best (so far). No spoilers though, you will have to read it for yourself.
Barrel of laughs. I've never read the Author's blog so nothing is redundant to me. Anyone who has dealt with a pet, being a child, having a parent, suffered from depression... well everyone who has lived can relate to the topics contained in this book. It is a gut-bustingly funny as all get out book. Better than smoking something. I can't make it through a single page without howling so hard that I can't continue and I'll re-read the page and wooo-hooo, it's like the piece of corn under the refrigerator (you'll have to read the book to understand that reference) the cycle of laughter is on! I can sooo relate to the content and it is more than refreshing, it's pure unadulterated JOY! I have never enjoyed a book this much. I look forward to more from this author.
Allie Brosh's frankness about her thought processes, depression, and childhood is most refreshing. Her simple illustrations add humour and even more insight to her tales. I love the multicolored chapter format of the book as well. Makes reading a selection easy & fun! Her stories of being a parent to two most unusual & neurotic dogs are quite funny. Equally inviting is her most frank description of her battle with depression. Allie's openness, illustrations, and vivid descriptions allow a most touching & even humourous insight into a victim of depression's thoughts & perceptions. Seemingly light, funny & entertaining on the surface,, Hyperbole and a Half, has deep roots and a message. Get a copy and ride the rollercoaster of life through Allie Brosh's eyes!
Great book by my favourite blogger. This book totally lives up to my expectations. I would recommend it to anyone!
Please, please, please go to her blog of this same name and read the story about moving to Oregon.  I think it's titled something like 'Dogs don't understand basic things'.  I am in my late 50s, and I absolutely rolled when I read it.  Laughed till I cried.  You get the picture.<br/>Her drawings are genius.  They seem simple and crude, but she is perfectly capable of producing more detailed and sophisticated drawings.  In spite of the simplicity of her art, she conveys emotion and movement very deftly, and in ways I simply don't understand.  (If you're confused about the drawing of Allie herself, the yellow cone is her pony-tail.)<br/>I'm afraid I am incapable of describing her writing, but like I said -- rolling and crying.<br/>Buy this book.
If you don't already follow Ms. Allie Brosh online, this is a great starting place. Don't let her work-of-art illustrations and oddball humor turn you off before you read it. H&1/2 is poignant, hilarious, and honest. Is it too early to call her the voice of our generation?<br/><br/>If you DO already follow her, the book is still worth the price. The full color printing is well-done and the style is not lost in translation to print (although you have to use the muscles of at least one whole hand to turn the pages, as opposed to just your scrolling-finger...think of it as a workout). The extra content is on par with what you already know.<br/><br/>And this means you can enjoy H&1/2 even when stranded in the wastes of Montana without any WiFi!
Allie Brosh is a Lynda-Barry-level genius.  Her drawings don't have the detail and beauty of LB's, but that's not her style.  Brosh tells funny and affecting and up-to-the-minute stories of her childhood, her dogs, her depression, and a few other random things including how to be an adult.<br/><br/>Sounds like some self-centered snoozer, right?  Not at all.  The essence of genius is to look at ordinary things in extraordinary ways, and that's what Allie Brosh's gift lets her do.<br/><br/>On the surface this seems aimed at young slacker types, but this geezer baby boomer didn't stop laughing at the funny stuff or being stunned by the emotional impact through the whole book.<br/><br/>Look at a few pages, and I defy you to stop reading.
... Yet, tragically true. I loved this book, and was immediately captivated from page one. It took me a while to crack it open, because I'd assumed (and boy, as I moronically incorrect), that it was going to have a "self-helpy/my life used to suck, but now it doesn't and I'm committed to spewing positive reinforcement on you until you believe you can jump off a cliff and live" type of tone.<br/><br/>This couldn't be further from the truth. This book is a must-read, must re-read, must-recommend, must-Tweet about kinda book. You'll hope you never have to put down (not even to go to the bathroom, or when operating heavy machinery); and you'll most likely feel a little sad once you turn the last page.<br/><br/>Oh, and the illustrations ... ? Priceless!
This book is about 50% new material, and 50% material from her blog. It's well worth the price. Extremely funny.
I was a latecomer to the Hyperbole and a Half blog.  I was going through a rough period in my life and I was introduced to the blog when I stumbled upon a link posted on an online news forum.  I enjoyed the simple but mood lifting stories immensely.  I purchased the book to support the author.  It's funny because I'm STILL not used to reading the stories out of a physical book.  It feels weird!<br/><br/>I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read light-hearted short stories/vignettes without having to commit to reading for a long period of time.  Perfect book to pick up and skim and set back down again and not feel guilty for not finishing the book faster.  Reading at a slow pace while randomly chortling is recommended.
Got the book yesterday - and was so excited to open and read - gosh what a surprise when I flipped open the first page!  Full color - great drawings - just like her awesome website.  I wondered how they would do - translating a vibrant and exciting site to a paperback and they have done a super job.  I would have happily paid more.....<br/><br/>I am only allowing myself to read a few stories a day so I can make it last - so far GREAT!  A few old stories from the web and some great new stuff mixed in.<br/><br/>Everyone should enjoy the drawings, stories and meaning behind each tale.....thanks Allie, thank you publishing company for keeping Allie, Allie.<br/><br/>Guess what my loved ones will be getting for Xmas!
She really is.  The best.  Of the best.  And her dogs are phenomenal.  Both of them.  Don't you agree?  I do.
This book made me laugh out loud so hard I was crying and couldn't keep my eyes open to keep reading.  My 15 year old son thought I was nuts, so I handed him the book.  Within 2 minutes, he was laughing hysterically and handed it to my 12 year old son, who, as I'm sure you've guessed, couldn't stop laughing.  Can you think of any text that makes a 12 year old male, a 15 year old male, and a 41 year old female all laugh out loud?  That is only skillfully achieved through quality writing, poignant satire, humorous observations about the human experience, and simplistic yet hilarious illustrations.  There is substance here.  In this stressed out life, I will be giving this book to at least 5 people this holiday season.
Allie Brosh has had me laughing till I cry, and crying till I laugh for years.  I don't know how it took me so long to buy her book, but I wish I could buy a sequel or two as well.  Maybe people who have storybook picket fence lives won't get it, but I use Hyperbole and a Half as a judge of someone's character.  If simple dog doesn't make you laugh until you cry, you're probably devoid of humor.  If the depression comics don't help you understand someone better, you're probably a sociopath.<br/><br/>I also like how I can point to Allie when someone makes fun of me for refusing to learn Photoshop, Gimp, or Powerpoint at work.  If MS Paint good enough for a fancy published writer/artist, it's good enough for me.
Allie's approach to story-telling is truly unique. Her humor is incredibly insightful. I follow her blog and initially purchased the book simply to have a hard copy of her stories of Depression (Part I and II), which, if you don't know, were separated in time by a long and significant struggle with depression. That said, I enjoy all her writing (and illustrations...it's hard not to laugh when looking at them), and there are stories in the book not on her blog.<br/><br/>I've now purchased this book 3 times because I keep giving my copy away after visitors come and fall in love it! If you're not sure about the book, just read her blog first. No surprises so I'm perplexed there are ANY negative reviews.
I loved Allie Brosh on the web and I was sure I would love her in a book. Well, yeah, but the book is painful to read. It is printed in a tiny, sans-serif font on heavy, shiny paper stock. Colored paper stock. I can barely read the text. It shimmers in front of my eyes. I'm getting old but dangnabit, so are many people. Why design for twenty-year-olds with perfect vision?<br/><br/>The tiny font may have been required because they printed the book on such thick paper; they had to keep the page count down in order to keep the printing cost manageable. If they had used thinner, non-shiny paper with lighter color backgrounds, and a larger serif font in black, the book would have been much more readable.
I've been meaning to review HYPERBOLE AND A HALF by blogster-turned-bestselling writer Allie Brosch.  Trouble is, every time I crack the book I start laughing and I can't help but read it all over again.  This book does the blog two better, not only by being permanent but also by having colored page sections.  Just like the AAA Tour Books!  Totally unnecessary, but Allie Brosch somehow hits just the right silly/meaningful here just as in his online work.  No wonder the book is such a hit.  Highly recommended, and many thanks to the "UW" grad who made it possible.
I got this book in the mail, read the back cover and the front page, and was already in hysterics. I've loved keeping up with the Hyperbole and a Half blog online, and being able to have some of my favorite stories in print on my coffee table is fantastic. And as if that wasn't worth it already, the new stories are equally funny and strangely heart warming. Allie Brosh is such a hilarious woman, and I truly respect and admire her for her strength and willingness to share her story and spread the love. I don't think anyone can read this book and not smile the entire time.
I love to read.  And i buy books on amazon and for my kindle all the time.  It has been a long time since I belly laughed out loud reading a book.  I even put it down so I can enjoy more tomorrow...to prolong the reading of it.  That never happens!!  This book is fantastic.  I completely relate to ALL of it.  Thank you Allie (you don't know me, but maybe you ARE me? Or a way funnier version of me?). I love this book so much.  Also, it's much bigger than i imagined, meaning way more content than i expected, and a really nice hearty book.  You did everything right with this book.  You can tell there was attention paid to all details.  <3
Went into this expecting irreverent comedy. Found myself laughing, yes, but also surprised at the emotional impact of the book. What we have here is not just a series of amusing situations. This is an introspective journey into the mind of a recluse. Anyway who has had periods of self-imposed isolation, bouts of melancholy, or feelings of unfounded superiority will see themselves in this book. In particular, the chapters on depression and self-hatred were powerful, yet remained funny. Also, anyway who has dogs, especially dysfunctional ones, will love this.
I've read some of Allie Brosh's blog posts before so when the book came out I was excited to get my hands on it. I wasn't disappointed at all.<br/><br/>I sat down and read the entire book in one evening and spent about half the time laughing so hard I started crying and/or could no longer breathe. For me, the chapter about the "helper dog" really got to me - I couldn't continue reading for a while and had to take a break while I got myself together.<br/><br/>Buy this book and you're almost guaranteed to be laughing in the first five minutes.
If you read Depression Part I or II online like the rest of the world, you should have a pretty good idea of what this book is and what it does. It is hilarious and insightful, and it makes you laugh so hard your face is so wet with tears you won't know if you're sad or happy or just confused.<br/><br/>You'll either get this or you won't. Don't take my word for it, read one of her blog posts, and if you love it, you'll love this. If you don't, you're probably the Grinch Who Stole Christmas and you shouldn't be allowed to buy books on Amazon anyway.
I've followed Allie's blog for years. Her story of starting the blog instead of studying for her physics final made me a fan for life (I'm a Chemistry major). This book is great. It has a lot of her classic blog posts and a few new ones. The new ones aren't as snappy or witty as the older ones and i'm guessing that has a lot to do with her depression (which she writes about in the book). Don't get me wrong they are still hilarious and great (just not make me pee my pants funny like the others are).<br/>I hope to see more from her.
Hyperbole and a Half is one the most down to earth yet hilarious books ever written. From  it's lovable narrator to it's charming cast of characters, this book will teach you life lessons and make you laugh so hard you cry!<br/>  I wasn't hoping for much when I started to read this book. I was hoping for a quick and light read to pass time after school. What I got was so much more than that!<br/>  Don't be hesitant to buy this book. I would reccomeend it to anyone, no matter what you're looking for!<br/>  A great read!!! :)
I'm not entirely sure how I've spent an inordinate amount of time online without coming across hyperbole and a half. Last week I heard an interview with the author Allie on NOT, she sounded funny and intelligent so I decided to get her book. I'm sincerely glad I did. Her style of narrative punctuated with the comics is really fun, funny, and entertaining. I only wish the book were longer, though I suppose that's what the blog is for. Highly recommended, even if this is the first you've heard of hyperbole and a half.
This book is really really funny.  I was impressed with the amount of additional (hilarious) content.  If you think about it, Allie Brosh has probably generated the most numerous and enduring memes on the internet;  ALL THE THINGS, pain scale, Alot, spagetta nahdle!  I buy a book once every ten years, and I can say without a doubt, that I'm glad this was my choice for 2010-2020.  If you think you know funny, you are so wrong it makes philosophers weep, you don't know funny until you've read this book!
I read the author, Allie Brosh's blog, and I find her hilarious. When she said she was making a book, I was excited because she said there would be some new content for us all. Boy, when she said new content, she meant it. This book was five times as long as I expected it to be, and full of her funny and poignant blog entries as well as new adventures and misadventures to share with us. I laughed, I sympathized, I even shed a tear or two. It is definitely worth spending the money to buy this book.
The goose, the goose! I laughed so hard my family thought I was going crazy, and I guess I was, in a good way. And the God of Cake was also hysterical! But my favorite parts were the essays on depression. Somehow she manages to capture in two short chapters the essence of depression, and her artwork is perfect. I loved everything about this book and I will be eagerly awaiting her next book. My family even bought me a "Clean all the things!" apron for Christmas and I wear it all the time.
Allie Brosh is the funniest person in the world. You want proof? Buy this book. If you disagree, buy another copy. Repeat this process until you can no longer deny Allie's superiority in all matters of levity. My friend asked to borrow my copy. I gave her my book and then stole money from her purse when she wasn't looking. I ordered another copy because if I've learned anything from Hyperbole and a Half, it's that the ends always justify the means. Even if it makes people cry. Three thumbs up!
I looooovvveeed this book!!! Freaking hilarious. A friend posted about it on FB so I bought it. I was really surprised. I read the entire book in a night and laughed my butt off.....but it actually made me cry too. The author has a series in the book dealing with her fight against depression. I could relate soooo well and it was wonderful to be able to read it to my husband and for him to understand through the author's portrayal. I bought a copy for a friend and sent it to her too.
I have been a reader of allie's blog before this book came out. When I found out it was out, I immediately ordered one for myself and 5 more for my close girlfriends. We all love it so much. I appreciate Allie's sensibility, humor, and vulnerability. My friends and I are in the mental health profession and we have truly appreciate Allie's depiction of depression. Thank you. Thank you. I hope this book continues to reach to people who have yet to embrace the authenticity of humanity.
I think Allie Brosh is actually one of the best writers of this generation. She's able to pick apart her experiences in a way that makes them completely relatable. Like, childhood binging on cake? Yup. The various levels of emotion experienced with depression? Yup.<br/><br/>I would buy this book for everyone.<br/><br/>Also, it's like, printed super nice? All bright and crap? And the pictures are good?<br/><br/>Whatever. Just buy it, loser. As if you really need me telling you.
I love her honesty.  I read it in one day.  My husband bought it for me and read it first after he opened it to see what it was.  I found her when someone posted a link to her blog with the part about depression to explain it.  As someone who has been depressed and tried to explain it to loved ones, I bookmarked her link.  But it is so much more than that. Just her raw honesty and willingness to be true is great, but then it is entertaining too.  It's nice to know I am not alone.
I read her blog then bought her book. Her artwork is funny along with her stories. I have shared her web site and book with my best friends, but you either get her or you don't. If you have ever had a crazy neurotic dog, you will relate. If you have every been a bit crazy and neurotic, you will relate. If you have ever been depressed, you will relate. I have to say I find her hilarious, but I think her parents must be saints if she really did all the stuff she talks about.
I'm a huge fan of Allie's blog and the book did not disappoint. It's clever, well written, and hilarious.<br/>Allie has a way of capturing truly awkward moments and elaborating them through illustrations and written language makes for a great read. While the stories range from stories I like to ones I couldn't wait to share with everyone I've ever met, her treaties on depression is truly inspirational. Anyone suffering from, or has a history of, depression must read this.
I was a fan of Allie before this book from her website at hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com<br/><br/>Some of these stories are from there, but there are many new ones. They are just wonderful. She has such a talent to capture expressions and situations even using such simplistic imagery. I absolutely love her work. She also captures depression in a series of gripping chapters. A must read for people who would enjoy a good hearty laugh, as well as some food for thought.
Allie has a knack for creating stick figures in an MS paint-like program that convey such exact emotion. Her writing style is abrupt and hilarious as she tackles a range of subjects from childhood memories, the travails of dog ownership, and depression. Her insight into her own psyche (and sometimes the readers') is keen and always amusing.<br/><br/>Good balance of text and pictures.<br/><br/>Highly recommend.
Book contains vortex full of strange beings that demonstrate that the deepest flaws of the human condition are, in fact, hilarious.  Humor is delivered via strange psycho therapeutic compound that dissolves deeply held shame and trauma into violent laughter that dissipates over several hours into tranquil state of being.  Best read with large glass of water handy as book is known to lead to dehydration via eyes.
I'm a big fan of the Hyperbole and a Half blog, and I've been waiting and waiting for the book to come out.  It arrived today and I told myself I would read it slowly, stretching it out for a while, but instead I devoured it.  I'm so glad I got this book--it has some of my favorite comics from the blog, plus many new ones that made me laugh out loud--and I look forward to rereading it many times in the future.
I was already biased when I got the book - I LOVE Allie's blog! I'm talking about the, "I have read the entire post archive, and many of those posts multiple times," kind of love.<br/><br/>Some of the pieces in this book were already published on her blog, but it was great to see them in print and to have an excuse to read them again. The new material is just as excellent as my old favorites!
I never read Allie Brosh's blog, but I bought this book for my daughter for Christmas anyway. It looked like a fun read. I didn't know that my daughter had just become a fan, and she was shocked and thrilled to have the book.  Didn't hurt that her dog looks a lot like Simple Dog.  I read parts of it before she took it away from me and went home.  It's really crazy and you can read and re-read.
This book is excellent its really been helping with my current depression. Allie Brosh is so shockingly spot on about everything I've been feeling shes even put into words things i didn't have words for. And the other tales she tells are very captivating and funny, the illustrations are hilarious, full of character, and emotion. This book is the stuff and its hard to put down I love it.
Allie Brosh is brilliant and witty. I've been a long-time subscriber to her blog, and a fan. When she revealed she was writing a book I had immediately intended to buy it. I was excited to have a hard copy of her work, and even more amazed when I read the new material released. Her stories make me laugh out loud, and I read them to anyone willing (or not for that matter) to listen.
If you are a fan of Allie's blog, this book is a must-have.  I have been laughing out loud for most of the book and haven't wanted to put it down.  Some of her funniest tales are captured here for your enjoyment.  The book is quite thick and is packed with laughs and wit that only Allie can deliver.  Possibly the best line in a printed work:  “You lazy, floor banana mother******!”
Seriously, if you need a good laugh, read this book! I have admired her writings/drawings/blog for a bit of time. She is very talented, descriptive and does a wonderful job capturing the realities of depression, life on life's terms, feelings- anything and everything- with humor. During my lunch breaks- I read her book which made me laugh so hard tears were rolling down my face!
I have been a fan of Allie's for a couple of years now. I am one of those people who checks her page every day and hits refresh obsessively, as if I think she's gonna post new content every five seconds. I was not disappointed with this book. Along with bringing back old favorites (How to tell if your dog is retarded), she added brilliant new content as well. Keep it up, Allie.
I have read most of her blog entries, but this made me crack up.  It came with some Christmas presents I had ordered and I read it all Christmas day while I was miserable and in bed with the flu, but it made me laugh so hard my whole body hurt.  Those stupid dogs crack me up.  They are like every ridiculously dumb dog that you have ever met, but more so.
Thank you.  Thank you SO MUCH for making this!  I need to ration out the chapters so I do not over-indulge in this goodness!  You are fantastic, and I want you to continue to write and draw pictures.  I will now be purchasing more for out of town family.  There will be copies in every house by christmas.  Thank you again.  The world needed this book.
she read my soul. I laughed out loud so many times my boyfriend could not sleep and kicked me out of our bedroom. I was forced to sleep on the couch the week I read this book but it was all worth it
My Husband reads to me at night before bed (couples time) and we looked for a funny book for our next read.....we ended up with Hyperbole and a Half. Oh my goodness! We were both laughing SO hard that we couldn't breathe. I think most people would find this really funny and there is something for everyone.  ........bottom line, we stayed up WAY past our bedtime reading and laughing together and it was great! Would definitely recommend to others.
... unless you don't mind weird looks from strangers as you snort-laugh your way though it.<br/><br/>This book is so funny, it hurts. Even the serious chapters display a great knack for the absurd. I enjoyed every word. Thank you, Allie, for sharing pieces of your world with us. It was exactly what I needed during a challenging time of my own.
In addition to being terribly amusing, this book contains the most accurate and easy-to-understand description of long-term depression. And the author was attacked by an evil goose. It's like we're twins!
Some repeats but the new chapters are worth the purchase.<br/>Will not dissapoint if you are a fan of the blog.
It seems as though there are a lot of things people have in common in life. I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Laughed out loud, literally!  This is one I have read more than once and keep it around for a quick pick me up.
Brilliant drawing. Extremely funny way of telling this important story of life. I enjoy every word in this novel. I recommend this for everyone.
I loved this book! If I ever had a chance to meet the author, she'd be my new best friend. I've never read a book that felt as if it was written just for me. Funny and heartbreaking.
Just what I needed to cheer me up. Hilarious, witty and completely relatable. Illustrations complemented the narrative, very funny. Great book!
The only reason I gave four stars instead of five is because I wanted the book to be longer.<br/><br/>As always, Allie has an amazing ability to make me laugh while thinking about the uncomfortable feelings, possibilities, and situations we deal with in every day life.<br/><br/>It's incredibly empowering to know that there is someone out there who may be even more screwed up than I am. And that's okay. We're both still okay.<br/><br/>A great read. A must for anyone who has experienced even a measure of depression at any point in their life.
I just really enjoyed this book. it is very funny, very honest, and the illustrations were the icing on the cake. I will follow her blog now. I may be the only person who read this book who didn't know the blog existed.
This is the funniest book I've ever read. It kept me up all night. I laughed so hard that the next morning I woke up with abs and a positive outlook. Will read again.
Wow, I've met my twin, and I'm uncertain how I feel about it. Anyone who feels a little different, has ever owned a dog, had a mom, and possesses a bit more self-knowledge (and suffers from severe self-deprecation...but not) will love this book. Brutally honest. I'll never see myself in the same light again. You're amazing, Allie.
When I first started reading the blog this book is taken from, I loved the funny, candid way Brosh puts things.  The depression chapters really hit home and the way she describes well-meaning people reacting to her depression was spot-on.  The only thing I didn't like was the casual use of the F-word.
I have read Ms. Brosh blog and couldn't wait for her book to come out.  I devoured the book as soon as it was downloaded and I loved every bit of it.  I found my self relating to much of what she writes about.
This was an enjoyable read - the dogs totally cracked me up because we've all known dogs like that in our lives.
This book was awesome. After having just recently read (and hated) the Vampire Academy graphic novel, I was reticent to read another one...but knowing that it was Hyperbole and a Half made me pick it up anyway. And I'm so glad that I did! I ended up reading this in one sitting, it was just that good. I couldn't put it down, and I found myself laughing throughout the entire thing. This is definitely a book that everybody can relate to, and Allie Brosh is one of the funniest, most down-to-earth and extraordinary people. I'm so glad that she started her blog and ended up writing this book. I highly recommend this to everybody!
I LOVE this book so much! It made me laugh out loud and then get sad as I looked at depression through Allie Brosh's eyes. It's one of the only books I'd ever recommend to someone who suffers from depression.
Really honest and funny look at a lot of relatable situations!  Definite must read!  I can't wait for Allie Brosh to write another book!
Saw a review in People mag and immediately downloaded to Kindle while on Amtrak from Chicago to San Francisco. Hilariously funny, super impressed with the artwork (even tho stick-figure, the facial expressions are so, well, expressive!)  Highly recommend if you love ironic humor!
Goodness, what can I say that hasn't been said already? This book is a delight!<br/><br/>Hilarious, yes, but also very personal, intimate, and motivating. The stories are well-balanced between fall-out-of-your-chair funny and heart-breakingly honest. Allie is clearly a deeply observant person and she bears every insecurity in the most honest sense. Although these stories go to some dark places, nearly all of the chapters on depression end with Allie learning something more about herself and growing as a person to deal with her issues.<br/><br/>The comedic timing between the text and illustrations is perfect. Allie has a great feel for when to 'throw the punches' as far as humorous moments go, and she has an incredible knack for retelling situations from her life with the most absurd clarity. She finds the funny things in the most dire or frustrating circumstances. And I have to agree with many other reviewers, the chapters about her dogs are particularly great, especially to anyone who owns and loves canines.<br/><br/>I blew through this in just a day or two and came out the other end appreciating Allie Brosh so much as a person. I recommend this book to just about everyone because I truly think there is enough comic diversity within its pages to make anyone laugh.
This is literally the FUNNIEST book I have ever read. I cannot read this book in public because i cannot stop laughing out loud. The author is so human and genuine with her memories and inner dialog, I can relate to all of it
I have never laughed so hard while reading a book. Really, I've never laughed that much while reading anything. I'm hooked, Allie.
...and more than a few full-on laughs. I can't actually relate to the book (I can) because I'm totally a better person than the author (I'm not) and I never disappoint myself (except all the time).<br/>If you like laughing and feeling uncomfortable at the same time you should buy this book. If you sometimes cry while you _____ yourself this book might also be for you.
I've read many of the blog entries but the book made me laugh frequently! Very relevant to anyone in their 20's and 30's.
The adventures of ordinary life get a wonderful treatment in this book, from memories of youthful cake theft to attempts to accommodate the needs of "Simple Dog."
Allie Brosh is one of the funniest writers and best illustrated storytellers around. As someone who has also struggled with depression, its wonderful to see her tackling tough subjects just as well as she conveys the side-splitting exploits of her dogs. Cannot recommend too highly.
This book made me laugh out loud. The stories are brilliant, but the accompaning cartoon are even better.  Just brilliant!!!
Laughed until I cried. Laughed until my stomach hurt. Laughed until I couldn't laugh anymore.  My wife and I like to sit on the couch and read it aloud, because it's even funnier when you're trying to fight through the giggles and finish the paragraph.  Most of the time, you fail.  Everyone I know is getting this for Christmas.
dark , intimate, funny graphic novella.....captures the inner mind of depression and neurosis.  good for dog lovers and those who work with kids and other human beings.
I shook with silent laughter while tears streamed down my face. Excellent story telling and superior illustrations. Will recommend to everyone I know.
I read this adorable book in a day (Thanksgiving Day 2013).  So refreshing.  Allie's insights into human nature are razor sharp and complemented brilliantly by her wit and her whimsical drawings.  She had me laughing the whole drive back from NYC.  This holiday, I am thankful for Allie Brosh!!
This book should be mandatory reading for anyone working in the mental health field.  Allie Brosh captures depression and makes it understandable to the masses.  Plus her Helper Dog is hysterically funny.  I cannot imagine anyone who would not gain something by reading this book.  Buy one for yourself and one for your therapist!  May the corn be with you...
Allie Brosh is awesome. I first found her blog titled Depression Part 2and thought it was the best description of depression I have ever seen. Her blog is wonderful and this book is an extraordinarily romp through her mind - with cartoon illustrations. Perfect.
Super funny....and touching. Loved every minute of this book. Thanks for the laughs and tears of happiness. Got kicked out of bed twice for laughing and waking up the husband
Will be buying this for Xmas gifts.  A great read and one I know I will revisit.<br/>I especially loved her dog chapters.
I will never tire of Brosh's incredible humorous insight into humans and how we interact with the world and its creatures.
Amazing, just...AMAZING! I love, love, love this book. It`s so funny and full with some really fancy drawings of dogs and people. I just..THANK YOU, ALLIE.
Loved this book.  Some of the material borrowed from her blog, but some new stuff also.  She totally gets both my dog and me.  One of my favorite authors.  Thank you for not being afraid to say aloud what the rest of us are thinking.
When one has read years of someone's blog for free and still pre-orders their book just so they can have an easier way to reference material from that writer, then I think it is safe to say it is worth the time to review the work. People don't even realize "All The Things" that came from this lady's brilliant mind, but they will now, and I, for one, hope she keeps writing - because the world is a happier, funnier place as a result of her work.
I literally laugh out loud every time I read this. Once I was introducing a friend to my favourite stories and we took turns reading it out loud but were laughing til we cried and couldn't gasp out the words. This despite the fact that other people in the (public) area kept shooting us "what is wrong with you?!" looks!!
I love Allie's sense of humor, her silly illustrations, and her attitude about depression and coping with all the weirdness in life. I'm a huge fan of her blog and was excited to get this book! There were some classic bits from her blog, and some new stories, too. I especially liked the bit on procrastination. HAH!! A fun read.
I expected there to be a little more new content in the book, being the Hyperbole fan I am.  I love Allie's work and have read most of what's on her website.  That being said, I was a little disappointed at the repeat stories.  If you're looking to get a "newbie" introduced to this lovely comic, this book is a great gift to give!
I love Allie Brosh's first book, it is so funny and yet it has great depth. This is an excellent book for those dealing with mental illness or depression, and for their friends and family, for its funny way of dealing with every topic.  It will make you see the world differently and talk about the hard aspects of life.
This book is hilarious. If you've ever read Allie's blog you know she's hilarious. This book is like getting a bunch of blog posts all in one. There are a few repeats from her blog but most of it is new content. TOTALLY worth it, I read it in one afternoon and could not stop laughing. Great coffee table book or gift.
Got this for my wife as a gift.  I knew immediately it was her type of humor after seeing it on a bookshelf at the store.  This is hilarious and she can't stop reading it.  She loves to show it to guests when they come over and giggle with all of her friends at the funny stories.  Wish we could give this more stars!
I don't often buy books of the comics I read online, but I'm SO glad I got this one.  It also has a lot of new stuff, of course, but even the stories I'd already seen are really beautiful in this format.  I loved the layout, and the content, naturally, is the hilarity and poignancy I've come to expect from Brosh.
We love Allie Brosh! This book is twice the size of other blog-to-book offerings, so it was a nice surprise to see so much Simple Dog, Helper Dog, and crazy Allie of all ages in the same binding. I'll spend the next several months reading and re-reading and laughing along with her creativity.<br/><br/>Go Allie!
This book is fun, funny, modern, and insightful. I couldn't get through it fast enough. As a dog owner, and someone who struggles with depression, Brosh found words for thoughts and feelings I can't explain. Even if you're not familiar with her blog, pick this book up for an incredibly enjoyable afternoon.
The best content is on the blog. I think the webpage format works better, and I found a lot of the print-only content to be pretty weak.<br/><br/>That said, Hyperbole and a Half is wonderful and deserves support. And the book is a nice conversation piece to introduce people to the wonders of simple dog.
I bought this for my 28-year-old daughter for her birthday.  She loved it!  She's an English teacher going to graduate school and needed something fun to read for spring break.  She recommended it to my 42 YO daughter.  I read a couple pages before sending it, and I think even I (62 YO) would enjoy it!
A lot of heavier stuff in Allie Brosh's stuff. The childish drawings are deceptively deep, the stories all have their humor and their grounded realism. She calls it very honestly, the Hyperbole part, but it's the exaggerated emotions that accompany life events, and it really puts you in the situation!
I have never read a book like Hyperbole and a Half and I fell in love! I would laugh out loud sitting in my living room. I wanted to read it all in one day but I didn't want it to be over! I can relate to almost every story which makes it so great. Honest and hilarious. I highly recommend to everyone!
Hyperbole and a Half is one of the best comic-narrative blogs I have ever read. Allie Brosh humorously tackles subjects from moving, to Kenny Loggins, to depression all flawlessly in her own characteristic voice and with brilliantly seemingly-crude illustrations. Seriously worth every penny and more!
If you've ever felt depressed and inadequate, you will probably see yourself in this book as well as get a laugh out of it. If you've never felt that way, you may well be a conceited jerk, and you probably won't get it. The author puts her heaviest emotions directly out there but uses a light touch.
I couldn't put it down, and it made me laugh out loud.  The language is colorful and her style is original, very human.  I was embarassed at some of it though.  I would recommend it to those not offended by some pretty raw language.  I am generally in that camp, but this one was worth the read.
I love this book.  Funny and heartbreaking at the same time.  First found out about Allie and her genius when I read her blog post about dogs moving.  I had to stop reading because I was at work and kept gasping for air.  While most is funny, the chapters on depression were especially poignant.
Brosh is so insightful and witty.  Her art is endearing and expressive.  I laugh out loud and laugh again later thinking about things she said or wrote about.  She expresses things about life and I just think - "Exactly!"  She is brilliant and I would love to have her for a friend.
I read this book in tortured fits of laughter.  Several times, my roommates heard my seeming cries of anguish and became worried about my safety and mental health, although in fact I was just laughing so hard I couldn't breathe.<br/><br/>Do not read near hypochondriacs.
This book is literally laugh out loud.  I love all the stuff about her dogs. She is very real and open and adds a twist of humor that makes her work relatable and hysterical.  I have lent this out to several people already. I want all my friends to read it.  It's great.
Have you ever really considered life, I mean, really considered it?<br/>This book is fantastic. It will consider life for you, and do it with fantastic drawings.<br/>Since I bought this book I have become a better person. I would recommend it to any sentient being.
This was the book that I pretty much bought everyone I know. I think I purchased about 15 copies of it this christmas, and even snuck one in for myself. Great buy, enjoyable, laugh out loud funny and somber in places. Great gift for people with a sense of humour.
For anyone that has ever read or heard of this blog, this book is a must!  Even my grandma who has never heard of this blog (and doesn't even really know what a blog is) loved the stories i read out loud and thought they were hilarious.  This is my favorite book!
I'm a big fan of Hyperbole and a Half and this book is a great companion (plus I force friends and guests to read certain chapters ...). Whether you're already a fan or just looking for a gift, these chapters from Hyperbole and a Half are great to have in print.
I love it.  I was laughing out loud/crying and I can't stop telling my friends "read this part, read this part...it's so funny".<br/><br/>They don't always get it, but I don't think Allie Brosh is living their life the same way she lives mine so much.
This book is funny!  You must read it!  Allie Brosh is a genius!  Yes, I'm using a lot of exclamation points on purpose!  The simple drawings are so expressive and the material just "hits home" on an honest, humorous level.  I highly recommend the book.
The illustrations, the scenarios, the funny.  I can totally relate.  I picked it up in the bookstore, read a couple of pages and bought it, read a couple more pages and ordered another copy off Amazon to ship to a friend.  She loved it too. Very, very funny.
Laughed out loud at work, got weird looks. Then I showed my coworkers the book. One of them told me she woke up, couldn't sleep, thought of this, and laughed till she gave up trying to sleep. So, Alli is amazing and her book should be cherished *hugs book*
Amazing journey into the psyche of the author. Imaginative, inventive, and incredible. A must read! (Also get copies for your friends!) (and, no, I am not related to the author or get anything from this review - I truly loved the book.)
Amazing.<br/><br/>Can relate 100% and it helps me be able to laugh during my consistent bouts of soul-crippling depression. I love it. I love the blog and I love having the book to flip through whenever I need to laugh the F out loud.
Allie Brosh is an internet phenom of sorts -- she put up a web site, a few people found it, sent their friends to see it, pretty soon everyone is telling all of their friends and we're all out there and loving it.  We all love what she does.<br/><br/>But, strangely, in some way we not only love what she does, we have all ended up loving *her,* too. I think it's because she puts so much of herself into her work, she bares her dang soul, she shows us all shes got in there and we love what's in there and we love her.<br/><br/>The animations are deceptively simple, the story lines are deceptively simple, maybe that is the source of her judo -- we read it and allow ourselves to be caught into it because it's so simple.  But then we're totally with her, and loving her images and ideas and -- honestly -- loving her.<br/><br/>It's ridiculous.  And I'm pretty sure it's all been overwhelming to her, also -- she's just like this regular person who put up this little blog and next thing she knows people from all over the place are loving the shit out of her, she's being interviewed on NPR and who knows where else, there's thousands of people who would do about anything they could to help her however they could.  It's one hell of a stardom, very different from celebrity: celebrities are images, Allie is one of us; celebrities are created, Allie is family.<br/><br/>I'm going on here, which is also ridiculous, but is exactly the sort of thing that Brosh brings out in us.  Buy the book, sit back, let it come on to you in it's deceptively slow way, maybe watch yourself become in love with her as so many of the rest of us are.
That's not even an exaggeration. I bought four copies of the book, one for myself, one for my best friend, one for my mother, and one for my brother. I don't even feel guilty about getting everyone the same book because it is worth it, and its a book I want to share with everyone.<br/><br/>My husband and I have been fans of Allie Brosh for a few years now. I delighted in reading her posts aloud to him, and we did the same thing with this book. We have a habit of quoting things at each other from programs or books that we like, particularly The Office, Parks and Recreation, Arrested Development, Game of Thrones, Star Wars, and Hyperbole and a Half. I've lost count of the number of times we've sent images of an Alot to each other through texts, and every time our dog is looking out the window one of us is bound to say "AM WILD ANIMAL". Allie Brosh's writing and illustrations are not only perfect for making you feel better on a bad day, but they are great for remembering the chaos of your own childhood, and recognizing how most of us struggle to be adults and reach that oh-so-desired ideal of "having it all figured out". We're not there yet, but we're okay today- and that's okay too.<br/><br/> In a world filled with repetitive or downright insulting "humor", Allie Brosh's creative talents are a breath of fresh air. Her posts are both relatable, and completely unbelievable (in a good way!) and she balances sincere feelings with hilarity in a masterful way. From dogs to cake to hot sauce to depression, Allie Brosh covers it all. This is a book to read again and again and again.
This book had me crying with laughter.  Her description of Clinical Depression is one of the most accurate I have ever read.  I heartily recommend this book to everyone.  Her "simple artwork" is also amazing and beautiful.
I love this book.  It made me laugh, think, feel and know someone else has thoughts like me.  The chapters on depression are so well written.  Anyone who has had depression will identify with some part of it.  Yea for this book!!
Probably the funniest book I've ever read. My boyfriend and I read each vignette together, and sometimes are laughing so hard we have to put the book down until we recover. Thank you, Allie Brosh, for being such a comedic genius!
I bought this book for my girlfriend as a birthday present. She absolutely loves Allie Brosh's material. We were reading through it together and she was laughing so hard that she was crying at the very first comic. It was great.
Purchased this book twice now! Once as a gift for my sister and once for myself. This author has a blog by the same title "Hyperbole and a Half" and she brings me to tears of laughter quite often. She is hilarious and yet she also manages to explain things so perfectly that you are simply speechless when reading her words thinking: "That is EXACTLY how I wish I could have described it!"<br/><br/>Depression...Both of her blogs regarding depression will amaze you if you a) suffer from depression and really wish that you could make someone in your friends and family understand just what you are going through or b) you know someone who is depressed and you wish you could understand why they just can't get out of that slump! I have directed a number of friends and family to this blog and every single person I have ever directed has responded with positive feedback.<br/><br/>For a super fast yet perfect introduction to Allie Brosh's amazing blog, I recommend "A Better Pain Scale." If this one doesn't have you near tears, then go no further.<br/><br/>For the most laughter, I recommend "The Year Kenny Loggins Almost Ruined Christmas" followed closely by "How a Fish almost destroyed my childhood." The Kenny Loggins one can only be found on her blog. If Allie Brosh releases a second book with more of her blogs in it's pages, I will buy that one too! I only hope she puts the Kenny Loggins one on paper soon! It's my favorite.<br/><br/>Support this amazing blogger! Buy this amazing book! Allie, give us more! We will support you!
Allie Brosh is a hilarious writer, and surprisingly talented with MS Paint. Her stories of growing up are relatable and fun. If you've never seen her blog, I urge you to check it out, and then buy this book. And the calendar.
I recently received this book as a birthday present from my cousin. I was fairly familiar with Allie Brosh's blog (also titled Hyperbole and a Half), so I figured I would enjoy it. I did not, however, anticipate exactly how much I would enjoy it.<br/><br/>This is the hardest I've ever laughed at a book that was not written by Terry Pratchett. And believe me, that's high praise.<br/><br/>I'm not one to usually laugh out while reading but I found myself constantly doing so while reading Hyperbole and a Half; more than once my puppy fled the room in terror of my insane laughter.<br/><br/>The book is a collection of real-life stories, along with pictures in Brosh's signature deceptively simple style. There are stories from her childhood, stories from her ongoing "adulthood", stories of her triumphs, stories of her struggles, and, most of all, stories about her insane yet lovable dogs. Brosh manages to be gut-wrenchingly hilarious while also being heartfelt and relatable. I caught myself constantly thinking "I'm the exact same way" or "tell me about it", even as I snorted and honked with laughter. Her comics about motivating herself to be productive and how she struggles being a "real" adult especially hit home for me.<br/><br/>My one meager complaint about this book is that it was too short. I tried to pace myself while reading, not wanting the book to come to end, but it was so hilarious and poignant, I flew through it. I would absolutely recommend that everyone give this book a shot. You will not be disappointed.
It took a while to get used to the illustrations but I thoroughly enjoyed them.  Her insight into depression was the most profound chapter in the book and anyone wanting to understand how it feels should read it....twice.
This was a really clever and funny book. But also parts are very serious. I would not read this book if I were depressed to start. The drawings are whimsical and lighthearted, masking the drama of the topics underneath.
This is the exact book I needed to read right now. Allie Brosh has the unique ability to entertain and teach at the same time. I've learned more about myself reading this book than I could have ever imagined possible.
Allie is a clever (and brave) young woman that puts her heart and soul out there for all to see in a funny, touching, beautiful way. I love her skill with words and a pencil, and would recommend this book to everyone!
We find ourselves infortunate situations now and then, or more frequently than we would like.  Her drawings are so expressive.  Caused a relative of mine to laugh out  loud on airplane.  Glad I was home to read it.
I've read from other reviews that A) they read the book within a day B) it is not well written C} it was uncomfortable to read because the author hates herself and D) the illustrations suck.<br/><br/>A) I also read the book within a day. Mostly because I could not put it down. I relate to the author on so many levels and I felt like I also lived her story. Just because you can read it in a day doesn't mean it's not a good book. I read a book that was 1000+ pages within 2 days.<br/><br/>B) The book is not really meant to be written like a novel. These are stories from her blog, put into a book form. My opinion is that it is extremely well written and witty for a blog.<br/><br/>C) The book is very honest, which is a reason why I love it. For people who have experienced depression, this book really makes you feel understood. It has the most accurate description of depression that I've ever read. There's always comedy in this book. Your taste in humor may not fit with the book, but it certainly did for mine. As for the rest of the chapters where people said it was uncomfortable, I never once felt uncomfortable while reading the book. I don't think the author hates herself. I believe she is exaggerating to amp up the story a bit. Or maybe these people just don't relate.<br/><br/>D) They aren't meant to be good. It's a part of the humor. I am in love with the drawings. The make up 50% of the story. I'm telling you they really contribute. She's not trying to be Picasso.
In a world filled with people who believe they are normal, it's nice to know that there are still some who enjoy being out of the ordinary. I've read this book about 8 times now and I'm in stitches each time.
This short book of observances, wisdom, and ramblings is hilarious except when it is not.  That is to say, most of the book is very, very funny.  However, there are some chapters on depression that are not funny but are well worth reading.  They are insightful and thoughtful and present such a looking-inside-out viewpoint that they will resonate with those who have suffered depression, whether severe or not, and those who live with chronically depressed people.<br/><br/>Having had quite a few wonderful dogs in my lifetime, the sections about dogs, and especially about Simple Dog, literally made me laugh out loud while I was reading, something that rarely happens.  I've had a few really terrific Simple Dogs and I've also had dogs like Helper Dog, the dogs that initially were the ones no one wanted, doomed to death unless some person like the author who thinks with her heart comes along.<br/><br/>The simplistic drawings, cartoons, graphic illustrations, or whatever might be the best term for them, are charming.<br/><br/>I read this on my first generation Kindle Fire, and a few of the drawings were a little too small, but most worked fine.<br/><br/>I was not aware of this author or her blog until some online friends told me about her, and I am happy they did.  I'm a fan.  I don't often give books 5 stars, and this one is not going to go down as great literature in the annals of time, but it is one of the best books I've read in the genre.
I ordered this book for the humor and I got pathos.  I got honesty with my humor and awareness with anxiety.  This is a book I had to pass on.  Her story is unique and universal.  It needs to be understood.
It's sitting here next to me and I haven't even gone through the entire book, but OMG I have laughed so hard, so many times! If Allie Brosh ever makes another book, I am so buying it!
A must have book! Allie Brosh's writing and illustrations are amazing. Everyone can relate to something in this book. Check out her comics on her site before, if you need convincing.
This book...HILARIOUS!  BRUTAL.  SIDE-SPLITTINGLY FUNNY!  PAINFUL.  GOOFY!  DROP-DEAD SERIOUS.<br/><br/>Ms. Brosh has written a BRILLIANT book.  Deeply personal and introspective, yet simultaneously accessible,  Ms. Brosh takes the reader on a circuitous loop, examining, questioning, rehashing, ridiculing and nakedly exposing her life.  Her brutal, up-front and unapologetic honesty and liberating, gleeful (and sometimes hallucinatory) hilarity never find themselves in opposition; they are a perfect melange - when one has a solo, the reader can sense the presence of the other "in the wings."<br/><br/>I absolutely believe that there's a "self-help" manual and highly beneficial and therapeutic patient mental health guide embedded (and not TOO deeply) in this book.<br/><br/>This book's artwork is SCREAMINGLY funny!  Poignant and revelatory at times, it's brilliant and hilarious ALL the time!  I howled when coming upon most of the artwork - brilliant on its own, GENIUS in combination with text.<br/><br/>I laughed VERY MUCH out loud (on a plane, on a shuttle, dining alone) while reading this book...and I DEEPLY appreciate Ms. Brosh opening up her life - like a self-descriptive cavity search - to the reader.<br/><br/>"Hyperbole" is a PHENOMENAL and MAGNIFICENT book!
The book's content? Maybe you know about it already from the blog, the one with the same name as the book. If so, you know that these are stories combined with cartoons -- artfully, deceptively simple cartoons. And you know that the stories, from life, are like life -- funny, horrible, cyclic, full of embarrassment, whimsey, mess, ambition, loss, imagination, the adoration of simple animals, and the cold fish slap of reality.<br/><br/>If you know the blog, you'll want this book. Not only are there new stories (about half), but some of the best blog stories are here, all in one place, and have been tweaked just a little to give the book a consistent look. The book itself is also a quality production, (I got the paperback.) Each page is thick and glossy, and the colors are bright. Plus, every chapter has its own background page color, so that the edge of the closed book looks like a roll of Necco wafers. It's actually kind of awesome, and you can find it in a pile quickly, which is good because I've been reaching for it a lot.<br/><br/>And if you don't know the blog, buy the book for a great read, a laugh, and a cry, mostly all at once.<br/><br/>Guaranteed that after you get the book, you'll immediately think of between one and four friends who also need it.
This woman is a brilliant goddess who knows the dark places, shines a bit if light into them and makes me feel less lonely in the universe. Somebody, please elect her to something!
Allie Brosh was on the cutting edge of people who turned blogging into an art form.  Her blog went from a fun little experiment, to a cult favorite, to a hugely popular phenomenon.  This book includes some of the most popular posts as well as some new material.  The bug-eyed unicorn in the pink dress on the cover of the book is Allie.  Actually, that's not a unicorn horn, it's a ponytail, although Allie says we can consider it a shark fin if we like.  This little character with stick arms and legs will lead you into her world of whimsical, self-deprecating,  thought-provoking humor.  Most of Allie's humor has something to do with the contrast between what we as humans THINK would be awesome, and then what actually happens. Allie the character (based on actual events in her life), tends to bite off more than she can chew, and relatable chaos ensues. Brosh is gifted at turning a small event into a something epic.  Little Allie, obsessed with Grandpa's gorgeous birthday cake but forbidden to eat it before the party, refuses to give up and becomes the heroine of her own action movie. It doesn't end well.  The conflict between ideals and reality becomes more serious and painful in the strips about Allie's recent struggle with depression.  She tackles it head-on with incredible honesty, and even as your heart is aching for her, you're still laughing because she's that damn funny. You will not regret immersing yourself in the colorful, lovable, unique world of Allie Brosh.
I love this book "Alot". Go have a look see at Allie Brosh's work online and if it's your kind of humor, buy the book for  bit more of that and to cheer a fab comedian on.
Hyperbole and a half is from the award winning blog of Allie Brosh. I enjoyed it immensely and this is a laugh out loud book. There are a lot of stories about her dog and how she thinks that her dog is retarded, then she conducted a dog IQ test so she would know whether or not there’s something wrong with her dog’s brain... There are also a lot of pictures like a comic book, I think this book is soooo random and most of the things that are written don’t make any sense. But hey! Not everything should make sense right?!<br/><br/>There are a lot of stories about how she got depressed for no reason, and I totally connected with that story. So maybe I’m weird too! Well weird is good! J When you read the book, there are a lot stories about her dogs and their adventures and their weirdness. Stories about when she was young and when she believed that time travel are possible so that she can talk to her future self. The story about being and adult and doing “adult things”, like paying the bills, groceries, and showering? Is like the story of my life! I’m getting there... Getting the ropes and tricks on how to be an adult! But being an adult is no fun!! Lol don’t even ask for my age... But I’m in my mid-twenties so yeah! I’m still a teen? Haha Great book!!
True story: There I was, reading Hyperbole and a Half, laughing at its funniness, and then laughing some more, and then laughing so hard that tears were streaming down my face, and then trying to read the next sentence but I was already laughing so hard that I couldn't even read the next sentence, and I had to *close* the book and *set the book down* and *leave the room* and *not read the book for more than twenty minutes* because at that point, even thinking of reading the book perpetuated my laughter. This has never happened to me before.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Allie Brosh has interspersed her extremely funny anecdotes with those that are simply really great and not necessarily funny at all but still really great.<br/><br/>And fortunately, along comes another extremely funny one.<br/><br/>Now I have had to put the book down three times.  No lie.<br/><br/>Yes, you should buy this book. I will be buying several, because I love my sisters and my friends, so I will share with them.<br/><br/>Allie Brosh has a website called hyperboleandahalf.com, which I found it after reading an author interview in the New York Times. I really like the website, but I think reading the book (perhaps especially as a book instead of an e-book) is even better.
As a lover of the blog I had to support the book! Great form factor for those that are a little technologically impaired or prefer the classic tangible experience of a book. :-)
Excellent, excellent, excellent combination of real world issues and quirky humor. A must read for anyone who has struggled with depression or loves someone who suffers.
Best, most hilarious book. One chapter is a great way to explain depression to people who don't get it. Great gift, I bought five and gave four to other girlfriends.
Loved it. She's brilliant. For people suffering from anxiety and/or depression, she found a magical way to make it very real, yet funny, she make it understandable.
Funniest book I've ever read. Hands down. Worth every penny. I find myself recommending this book to everyone because the problems Allie brings up are so relatable.
I’d seen reviews that piqued my interest in this book (which came from a blog), but then browsed the blog and lost interest. Finally, something made me take the plunge and acquire it. I did not like Brosh’s art style, especially her main character (herself) that looks a little like a fish. Yet that art, even of herself, is wonderfully expressive and, very early on, I started to love Brosh and this book.<br/><br/>It’s a memoir -- graphic-style vignettes about “unfortunate situations, flawed coping mechanisms, mayhem, and other things that happened.” Some are everyday-ish but with clever perspectives or presentations that reminded me how much I’d liked Amy Krouse Rosenthal’s <br/>. A few explore serious topics, for example a prolonged episode of depression and a pervasive discomfort in her own skin. Many others are laugh-out-loud funny -- childhood hijinks with her younger sister and several scenarios with her dogs (“The Simple Dog,” who is intelligence-challenged, and “The Helper Dog,” acquired as a friend for The Simple Dog but who is crazy).<br/><br/>Definitely saving this to enjoy again. And again.
Hyperbole and a Half is the most funny and fascinating book that I have read in a long time. It is so good, in fact, that I really don't know what to say about it other than, "If you haven't read this yet, why haven't you read it?" and "What are you doing still reading this review? Read the book instead."<br/><br/>But if you are still reading this review (and, really, you should be reading the book already), I'll just offer a brief list of the things that make this book so freaking awesome:<br/><br/>1) Really funny stuff about dogs that even a dyed-in-the-wool cat person like myself can thoroughly enjoy.<br/><br/>2) A great two-part exploration of the struggles of living with depression that do a better job of capturing what it is that this illness does to those suffering from it, while maintaining a relentlessly sharp and acerbic sense of humor and absolute rejection on the part of the author to play the victim card.<br/><br/>3) The funniest story you will ever read about a goose, guaranteed.<br/><br/>4) Brilliant, spot-on artwork.<br/><br/>Are you really still reading this? Go read Hyperbole and a Half already.
This book is a hilarity burrito  stuffed with comedy gold and covered in  insightful sauce. Buy it and find a spot to read it where you can laugh loud and hard.
I've never had so many people ask me what I was reading, even my teachers were curious. Well deserved spread by word-of-mouth, this book should be read by all.
Belly laughs all around!  Worth having around  -- love sharing with friends.  You can see some of the stories online but I love having a copy around the house.
Very good book!  Helps you realize their are others that feel as crazy as you feel sometimes! Frustrating but true! I hope Allie blogs and writes more soon!
I really should have paced myself, but I just couldn't stop reading. Allie Brosh's writing is just as delightful in book form as she is on the internet. The book is much longer than I was expecting, with far more new material. The quality is just lovely--glossy paper, bright colors. If you've never read Hyperbole and a Half before, you are in for a treat: brilliant comedic timing, gut-wrenching honesty, and the ability to bring the dullest events alive with deceptively simple illustrations. Her chapters on depression are some of the richest I've ever read. She has an astonishing ability to rip your heart open and make you laugh while she's doing it.<br/><br/>You will laugh out loud when you read this. Possibly to the point of breathlessness, or slight pants-wetting, certainly to the point of getting yourself in trouble at work or school if try to read it when you should be doing something more productive. So take a sick day, go potty, take a deep breath and jump right into Allie's world. You will not regret it.
I'm still new to graphic novels. After reading Jonathan Ames's "The Alcoholic" (and loved it), I wanted to find more graphic novels. My search led me to Hyperbole and a Half by Allie Brosh, and I couldn't be happier to have found this book! Allie Brosh's stories and illustrations of situations that have happened in her life are not only entertaining, but relatable. I love that she's able to reveal her thoughts and feelings that most of us would never admit to another person- or ourselves. "The Motivation Game" spoke to my procrastination (and how accurate about the banana...I do that myself with many items when shopping!). "Identity Part One and Two" made me look at my bad qualities while relating to her own. "This Is Why I'll Never Be An Adult" makes me feel less ashamed of feeling overwhelmed with responsibility. So much in this book also had me cracking up, from her letters to her younger self, to her simple dog, The God Of Cake reminds me of my own hyperactiveness when I was a kid! I have never visited Allie's blog before, but after reading this novel, I'm a fan!
If I could draw an "I love this book" Alot, I would (go read the blog :) ). I've been reading her blog for years, I can't think of too many authors who deserves this more than Allie Brosh. Her blog is absolutely hilarious, and has tons of stories on there. I suggest reading a few (hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com) if you're at all hesitant about buying this book.<br/><br/>I know I'll be purchasing many more as stocking stuffers for my family. You will love her stories--they're entirely relatable and the illustrations are absolutely hilarious.  I can't say much else other than that it will be the best 10 bucks you've spent all week.<br/><br/>I suppose I'll also add that the book itself is high quality, and as other reviewers have noted, each story is printed on different colored pages.<br/><br/>If you like cake, you'll love this book.<br/>If you have dogs, you'll love this book.<br/>If you've ever had depression, you'll love this book.<br/>If you have a sense of humor, you'll love this book.<br/>If you like illustrations, you'll love this book.<br/>Go get it!
I read this in one sitting as soon as I was able. I say this because I had to wait for my mom to finish with it first! Initially I thought she was feigning polite interest when she leafed through this book as I told her how excited I was to finally read it... but when I checked on her again a half hour later, she was still reading it and laughing out loud. This is a lady who will stop the car in the middle of traffic if she hears somebody drop an "F bomb", and this book has a handful or two.<br/><br/>Allie has a great and distinctive voice. Those of us who have read the blog will love revisiting classic stories, discovering new ones and even a reboot of an old blog entry (complete with screen shots of a familiar video clip). This book is a refreshing mix of humor and solemnity, holding a comical mirror up to some surprisingly deep concepts to which many of us, if not all, can relate. But for me, the best laugh had to be at the dedication at the front of the book.<br/><br/>It is full of treats for fans old and new. Thanks so much for being you, Allie!
It is brilliant. Give it as a gift. Buy some for your home. It is hilarious and wonderful and I love it and you will too.<br/><br/>Also: FUN COLORS!
I really enjoyed reading Hyperbole and a Half. My sister gave me the book for my birthday, and I quickly realized that I had read quite a few of these graphic essays online a few years back. I was pretty happy to have these in a book form, where I can peruse them any day I need to.<br/><br/>I think there are two main things I like about the book. First, sort of like reading Nick Hornby or David Sedaris (I actually find the ubiquitous comparison between Brosch and Sedaris to be quite appropriate), Allie Brosch has a way of putting the whole inner-workings of her mind out there--including those that are most embarrassing, dark, and twisted ones which we normally fight so hard to repress. The effect is one of recognition and pleasure. I read the book thinking, “Yep, that’s me, too… I’m glad I’m not the only one.” So, that’s refreshing.<br/><br/>The book is also really funny. Of course. The writing is sharp, and the pictures just add a lot of absurd, but truthful and crispy delivered, humor. I devoured the book in a day and am already recommending it
Okay so I have never heard of Allie Brosh the blogger - but I will tell you that this book was hilarious and that after reading - I became a regular reader of her blog!  I won't tell you the number of times I thought... "hey I do that"....or wow...."now that's messed up...funny but messed up!"  And I mean that in the nicest way possible.  This book leaves you feeling normal, human, and like there is another individual in the world who might be as wonderfully messed up as you!  You get to see such a creative side to the everyday neurosis that so many of us try and deny or hide from the world - and ourselves.  Allie Brosh is like "I have issues...and I get paid for them".  You go girl!  Oh and for the record, those with attention spans of gnats will really appreciate the colorful pages and pictures throughout the book - making it a pleasure and not a chore to read through.  You can even skip to different parts of the book - and there are no repercussions or guilt to be had!  Definitely an own, not borrow book!
Such a great book.<br/><br/>Read it cover to cover within 2 days.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of her blog, you'll love reading it in novel form.
Hysterically funny, if you've seen her blog you know what you're in for.  Her drawings and art are The BEST, most creative, to-the-heart!  Some themes may be wasted on young kids, they won't find everything funny, and the topics of suicide and depression should be discussed with your child, not denied, but you will want to choose that timing yourself.  Overall there is something that can make almost everyone howl with laughter: who's never had a silly or embarrassing childhood incident?  Some family member probably retells them at inopportune moments.  Allie's are much funnier from her point of view.  And her pet stories make you want to rescue an animal in spite of the trouble, though maybe take one for a test-drive first.  Allie has captured the most entertaining stories that real life offers.  She is not afraid to share her feelings and we love her for it.  This book makes you realize you can survive life (mostly) unscathed and shared laughter is the best way.<br/>I can hardy wait for her next book due out in October '15
I laughed out loud the entire book.  I love everything about Allie Brosh and was so happy the day I found out she made a book.  I love it a lot.
All 5.<br/>Such Funny.<br/>Amaze.<br/><br/>Only someone that's illiterate would be able to dislike this book; even then that's questionable.
Was a hilarious read! Thank you Allie for adding new material for the book - was great to read the old classics and have new laughs as well. :)
Hilarious book, I loved every minute of it. I'm buying more copies to give as Christmas gifts this year! I hope Allie writes another book soon!
This is such a great book and I was so glad to be able to give this as Christmas gifts this year! Wonderfully priced and always a joy to read!
I've already read this book like, 5 times in the 3 weeks I've had it. Reading it makes me happier than my obese grandfather on Thanksgiving.
Bought it for a friend as a gift, but ended up reading it myself. It really grabs on to your attention and it's a great reading experience.
Hyperbole and a half is truly brilliant.  Allie Brosh has a unique style and incredible sense of humor.  This book is pee-your-pants funny!
Having followed the Hyperbole and a Half blog for a while, I was excited to hear that there was a book coming out. If you're a fan of the blog, the book certainly doesn't disappoint. There is some material taken directly from the blog, some that seems to have been expanded for the book, and a few new stories as well. For those not familiar, Hyperbole and a Half is a collection of stories from the author's life, illustrated with hilariously bad MS Paint drawings and told in such a way that I think most of us can relate to the content in some form or another.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that in spite of the colorful pictures, this is NOT a book for children - there is a bit of swearing here and there, and even the childhood stories are told from the perspective of an adult looking back on the past, so it's a bit more relatable for adults than it will be for children.<br/><br/>All in all, I am very pleased I purchased this book, and I hope the author may eventually publish more of them.
I love Allie Brosh. She is so quirky and fun AND a great storyteller. I thoroughly enjoyed her book, and I look forward to more from her.
I don't own a copy. I used to, but I gave the first one to my therapist friend to use in her practice, then bought another one, and gave that one away, too, to a needy depressed friend. I need to order another ASAP! Oh, my God, she's good! (To the prissy schoolmarms who object to Brosh's liberal use of the "F-Bomb," as they so daintily call it. well, I say, "F---" ---No, no, let us be genteel here. She is raw, she's a child, she's an old soul, she's---just damned funny, and that's what this book is all about. Humor. Anyone who can get through "The God of Cake" without dying of incontinent guffawing is obviously an alien from Planet Grimjaw, where no one ever has a childhood. And "Dinosaur: The Goose Story" still gives me nightmares, if it's possible to have nightmares while laughing. Having survived a goose attack, I can only say, Allie Brosh, you nailed it. Oh, Allie, where art thou? We need more screams and giggles from you, darlin'!
If you love Allie's blog you'll love the book. I ordered a box for Christmas presents. ;) I actually have it for my Kindle and on paper.
Words can't explain how much I love Allie Brosh. This book is simply fantastic. Everyone should read it. Everyone's dog should read it.
Hands down, Allie Brosh has just about the most wonderful imagination of any creature currently not dead on this planet.  After reading the post about the imaginary "Alot" from years back, I became a huge fan of Hyperbole and a Half.  And while many of the stories in this book are taken directly from the popular favorites on the blog, there is also quite a bit of new material in here that is every bit as entertaining (e.g. "Warning Signs", "Lost in the Woods", "The Hot Sauce Debacle", etc).<br/><br/>I'm a pretty picky person when it comes to buying books since digital and real libraries satisfy roughly 90% of my literary cravings.  So when it comes down to that 10% that I just have to own - it needs to be something I will revisit over and over and never get bored of.  Hyperbole and a Half fits the bill and has earned a well deserved home on my bookshelf.<br/><br/>Highly entertaining, highly enjoyable, highly recommended!
It's ridiculous and painfully honest and hilarious and doggies and if you were smart enough to get the dead tree version, is ALL THE RAINBOWS when looking at it from the side.<br/><br/>If you like dogs, simple or otherwise, those chapters are tastier than bees. If you've ever been Depressed (not just a little bit sad, but clinically Depressed), or know someone who has been, you will understand a little better that whole dynamic.<br/><br/>If you've ever been or had a child determined to be the Cake God, you will laugh over those escapades.  Allie Brosh is clearly no Renoir nor even Picasso, but the crude MS Paint drawings are wonderfully expressive and charming in their own way.<br/><br/>It very clearly states "features new material and selections from HyberboleandaHalf.blogspot.com," and you know, it didn't bug me at all that some of the material I'd read on the blog already; I liked revisiting it.<br/><br/>From me it gets ALL THE STARS.
Absolutely, fall out of your chair laughing with this book. If you're a fan of Brosh's blog, Hyperbole and a Half, you'll love it. There are a few posts taken from the blog and inserted into the book, but there is plenty of new stuff to love! The simple MS Paint technique she uses to illustrate stories that are in some cases unbelievable is great. My one complaint would be to make it all completely new material, but since the older things are good posts, it's great. There are quite a few dog chapters too, which I love!<br/>Also, her two chapters of Adventures in Depression are incredible. A serious condition for many people that's made completely understandable. I've never had depression, but those two chapters helped me to understand this condition my friends have had a lot better than anything else I've seen.<br/><br/>All in all, buy this book. If you like to laugh, and like crazy stories with unique drawings, you won't be disappointed.
Brilliant. Allie Brosh is a genius. This is my very objective and unbiased opinion as a huge fan. I'm not going to pretend to be a literary critic here. If you like Hyperbole and a Half as a website, you'll love it equally as a book. It's basically an acoustic version of her website. No wifi signal necessary if you want to read it in a cafe instead of risking just enjoying a coffee without doing anything else for a few minutes.<br/>On a serious note, 'Depression Part 2' is probably the most important section of the book, being the most accurate description of depression i have ever read. Allie manages to condense the major points of a VERY difficult subject into one easy to follow, honest, funny (but sensitive) comic. It easily outranks anything i have read EVER, ANYWHERE regarding the subject. I'm being 100% serious when i say that reading this particular section should be mandatory. For EVERYONE.<br/>Highly highly HIGHLY recommended.
Funniest book I have ever read laughed myself to sleep 3 nights in a row BUY it you and the whole family will love it 5 STARS *****
“Hyperbole and a Half: Unfortunate Situations, Flawed Coping Mechanisms, Mayhem and Other Things That Happened", by Allie Brosh, is a collection of illustrated tales from her very popular blog, “Hyperbole and a Half”, with some new material added. I started reading the blog several years ago and immediately loved the quirky drawings and the unique sense of humor, and I was sad and concerned when Brosh seemed to disappear for many months to deal with severe depression, which she also wrote about and is included in this book. It’s so good to have her back and it was very generous of her to share her story.<br/><br/>But don’t despair that this book is filled with sadness and depression: it’s a HOOT! Bosh is a genius at being both self-aggrandizing and self-deprecating at the same time! She makes you want to pick her up (or her childishly-drawn little alter-ego with the strange yellow triangle “pony-tail”), and give her a big hug.
I am a fan of the Hyperbole and a Half blog and I pre-ordered the paperback version of this book when I heard it was going to be available. That meant it was waiting at my door yesterday. I laughed and cried my way through this thing and could not put it down until I finished it.<br/><br/>For those familiar with Allie's blog, this is just like it (except you can't make comments in it, well you can, but no one will respond). Except: it has some stuff that was not on the blog, and therefore this is greater. Awesomer.<br/><br/>For those unfamiliar with Hyperbole and a Half - Allie writes autobiographical stories with illustrations. And they are hilarious. Even when she is talking about depression.<br/><br/>I have a Kindle, and a Kindle Fire, but I bought this book analog, because of the pictures. And I am glad I did. Of course now I might need to buy it on Kindle so I can bring it with me everywhere I go.<br/><br/>Also: CAKE.
Allie Brosh is emotionally wise and hella funny. Her description of depression is spot on and she really nails how weird kids are.
The funniest book I've ever read. If you're a fan of her blogspot, I don't have to tell you any more. She's fantastic.
I'm not sure where to start with this book...to put it simply, just amazing. I was first introduced to her blog late 2009 by a friend, from then on, I couldn't get a enough! I would always find myself coming back to re-read her stories. Every one of the stories told always makes me laugh. Anyways, ever since I saw that she was going to make a book out of these stories, I knew I had to get it! I just got it today, and I'm a very satisfied customer. I've already read most of the book, and I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a good laugh and look at pretty pictures. Also, Allie, if you read this, thanks for making these stories available to us! Even though these stories are funny, they are your experiences. It takes quite some courage to post it for the world to see, so thanks again for making my day a little brighter. God Bless!
This is the funniest, most insightful book ever written.  I bought six copies,  one for me and fibe to give as gifts.
At times I laughed so hard that I cried. The illustrations are priceless! One of the best books I've read this year!
Long time fan of Allie's blog, this is just as good. It has a different feel, being on paper and all, but I love it.
This book is an insightful way to see ourselves and how hard we can be on ourselves! Honest ....hysterical ....real!
The majority of the negative reviews come from people who have<br/>1. Never taken the time to read the blog Hyperbole and a Half<br/>2. Never enjoyed the blog Hyperbole and a Half but somehow tricked themselves into thinking the book would be different.<br/><br/>For anyone who loves Allie Bosch and relates to her self-deprecating sense of humor, you will certainly adore this book and having it in physical form makes it that much better! I had to physically stop reading at points to gasp for air and found myself nodding vigorously for everything written.<br/><br/>For those of you calling the author selfish and shallow, save your characters the whole book is about her realizing that she is selfish and shallow but accepting herself for it and for the fact that she at least tries to be a little less awful as she likes to say.
Like another reader said, buy the paperback! I bought this for my Kindle Fire and while I'm not having any trouble with the graphics, it's just not worth $10! I feel SO ripped off. I think if the Kindle version was about $5-$7 that would be fair and I'd be more apt to rate it four or five stars. For a book that took me only a couple of hours to read, (and most of the material was on her website) I was so unhappy that I spent $10 on the electronic version. I do like the author and I don't mind the darker parts of her writing, (I actually find them a beautiful way of explaining depression) but I don't think I'll continue to support the author's endeavors at such a steep price. Really disappointing.<br/><br/>Update: Increased my review to four stars...while slightly still feeling duped, I seriously love this author. You got me!!
Great fun to read and significant insights into living with mental illness, whether it be in your dogs or yourself.
I nearly did not read this book – I think it was because I was being a bit of a book snob… and I'm so glad that at midnight one night I thought ‘What the hey-‘ and could not put it down.<br/><br/>So in the early hours of morning I was sitting in bed wheezing and cackling until I finished it. Except for the part on depression, for that I was like 0_0<br/><br/>I was amazed at how expressive Allie Brosh got the illustrations, having created them in Paintbrush and intentionally rough – I loved them! At the first illustration I thought 'Ermagerd This is hilarious!'<br/><br/>If you have dogs, or love dogs, or want a dog…. Or want to train dogs, this is a book for you.<br/><br/>Go read it. GO NOW! You won’t regret it.<br/><br/>The only reason I'm not giving it top ratings is because – yes, I'm definitely am a book snob.
I can relate to this book on so many levels.  Really enjoyed it.  Deep but light and funny too.  It's being human.
I love Allie Brosh's blog (back when she was writing it) and was really looking forward to this book.  Although, inevitably, some of my favorite blog entries were not included in the book, the ones she did choose are all excellent choices.  The new material, with one or two exceptions, is also good.  Her essays about her battle with depression are funny and heart-wrenching at the same time.  The only reason I didn't give this book five stars is the size.  The pages are too small to show her illustrations as well as they show on a computer screen.  Some of the text in the illustrations is so small it's hard to read.  I blame her publishers for that, not her.  So, keep a magnifying glass handy and, if you like Allie's work, you should love this book.  She's a unique, though troubled, talent, and I treasure her work.
I love this book! Allie has an amazing sense of humor, even when discussing serious issues like her own battles with depression. You find yourself pulled into her world and laughing at the craziest things along with her rather than feeling sorry for her. I've been hooked her on blog for years, and I hope she gets inspired to write more (and more! and more!) soon again. If you're not who she is, you should check out her blog before buying the book. Yes, the book contains mostly already published material, but I'm happy to have her work in hard copy now. And the new material is EASILY worth the cost of the book,! One suggestion--Allie, next time, avoid the dark colored pages with black type. It's sooo hard to read in low light. But heck that's the most negative thing I have to say! Did I mention I love this book??
Allie, I read your blog. I knew I would like your book before it arrived. What really struck me was how beautiful it was. The glossy, illustrated pages are so appealing. My sister is already clamoring to borrow it after I am done. I told her to buy her own copy. See, I've got your back.<br/><br/>People reading reviews to try and decide to buy: go ahead. It really is good. I read a bit of it out loud to my husband and had him rolling with laughter. And he couldn't even see the funny pictures. Ms. Brosh has a beautifully dark sense of humor that is complimented by her juvenile drawings. Her writing is bald and personal. So open that it feels like you're her therapist and her best friend, chatting over coffee at her dog's funeral. This is a weird review, I know, but it is such a unique book, it deserves a candor.
Such a great book! The best book we got in 2013. So glad I bought this one. Get it. It's well worth the few bucks
This book is a look at the life of the author with a humorous approach. The thing that sets it apart in my opinion is the honesty and openness with which it looks at what is clearly the dysfunction that we all pretend isn't a part of our lives.<br/><br/>Don't let the drawings fool you. This is an honest look into the imperfections that make our lives unique and the struggles we deal with. It is presented in a lighthearted and approachable format that is easy to take in small chunks or in one go.<br/><br/>One of the things it deals with is depression, If you know someone who has depression or struggle with it yourself, this is a great book to get more perspective on how it can affect people and how the author approached it. It's not all about depression though. Overall the book is lighthearted and fun.
I picked up a signed first edition, and now its worth nothing, due to the wear I have put on it!  Awesome book!!
I am a licensed psychologist with over a decade of experience.  Brosh's two-part description of her depression should be required reading.  It is an amazing, intimate look into the experience of crushing chemical depression.  The rest of the book is so wicked funny that if you have not exposed yourself to this, you need to.  I own printed and electronic versions of this book and have gifted the e-version to family.<br/><br/>Warning, do not start this book unless you have some time, it's hard to put down and you will be up late and make the next day difficult.  Also, do not start this book if you have a busted rib, hurt back, recently underwent surgery, or have any other condition that makes it painful to laugh.  Wait until you heal or they will have to redo your stitches, etc.<br/><br/>Enjoy.  :-)
How to describe this book? First, hilarious. I had to put it down several times because laughter caused my eyes to blur with tears and render me unable to breathe. Second, truthful. We all have do and say these weird, embarrassing things, but Brosh, by being truthful about her own crazy, reminds us we aren't alone with our weird embarrassing things. Third, comforting. In particular, her portions on Depression and Identity hit home for me, as I struggle with both. Her words gave me a way of explaining it to others that made sense, without the dark doom'n'gloom that my previous attempts invoked.<br/> In the end, I would recommend this book to most people, but each for different reasons. Some, for the humor, some for the connection and some to let them know they are not alone in their struggles.
I laughed and laughed with my grandson just had to edit some "bad" words.  It had some great pics too.
Okay, I'm not a big fan of profanity (and this author does use it moderately for reasons she states on her blog), but I found this book so funny that I could not contain my laughter ... at night ... while I was reading in bed... and everyone else... was ... sleeping. Her drawings, along with her life-inspired stories, were absolutely captivating. There is an entire section on a deep depression she experienced and it is indeed very dark, though sandwiched between the most beautiful hysteria. I really feel for what she went through with the depression and I applaud her for dealing with it honestly.<br/><br/>If you can get past the profanity, and you have a bit of a sarcastic, twisted sense of humor, you will LOVE THIS!!! I did!
I wrote a long, detailed review of this, my most precious and almost #1 favorite of all books the day it came out (and I got it because I was smart ebough to pre-order it,,,) but I included a link to Allie's blog, which was a no-no. So I'll give you my tl;dr version... BUY THIS!!! There is no downside. None. BUY IT for all your friends and relatives. They will love you more than the simple dog loves her power to make food. BUY ALL THE BOOKS!!!! The next person who runs for president and really wants to win should ust buy 200 million copies of this and give it to every voter in the country. They will be laughing so hard they will never hear your opponents' commercials and you will WIN THE INTERNET,,, uh, I mean, the election...
All the articles in here are amazing but the ones that stand out for me are Depression Part 1 and Part 2. As someone who's struggled with my personal demons all my life, it's become a regular "thing" to try and explain myself to people. In all that time, no one - NO ONE - has put it in words as well as Allie Brosh. I now loan this book to people when I want to help them understand depression and anxiety (mine, theirs, or someone elses).<br/>Everything is written to poke a little bit of fun and to be colorful rather than downhearted but it'll nevertheless leave no doubt as to the serious subject matter at the heart. Buy this book for the fun stories and, well, hyperbole ... but keep it and USE it for the deeper stuff.
As soon as Allie announced she was going to write a book, I knew I would be buying it.  I was very impressed when it arrived, because it was much thicker than I was expecting.  It's very well presented and of the material she included from her blog, there are absolutely no duds.  The new material is excellent a well.<br/><br/>The only thing I found a bit odd was that Allie has gone back and re-drawn several panels of her older works.  The "Clean ALL the things!" and "Internet forever" panels especially caught my eye.  This isn't a bad thing.  I'm sure Allie was simply updating older pictures to her current style, it was just strange to see such familiar images being juuuust different enough to be noticeable.
I read this book cover to cover, then in random pieces, then cover to cover again over the course of months. It is excellent. Funny, honest, humble, true and beautiful.<br/><br/>Yes, beautiful. When someone shares their most vulnerable self for the amusement and enlightenment of others, it's beautiful to behold. So while I got this book as funny bathroom reading, I find myself using anecdotes from it in therapy or in conversation with people about serious mental health challenges. I've used this book to help open people up to the idea of seeking help they desperately need. I've used it to cheer myself up during periods of anxiety or depression.<br/><br/>I don't regret this purchase and I highly recommend this book.
I'm a big fan of Allie Brosh's blog Hyperbole and a Half, so naturally I preordered her book as soon as I heard it was being released! I was surprised at how much was in it, especially new content. The two part series "Adventures in Depression" are also included which, although I've already read them on her website, was great to see included in the book. The tales are whimsical and entertaining and I finished reading them all in one sitting. It's a great book to keep on your coffee table to entertain guests with while you're doing various things around the house and they wait for you, or to just take a break from your daily happenings to dive into Allie's cartoon world full of quirky and lovable drawings.
This book was worth waiting for. Allie's confessional book showcases the kind of shame the rest of us often hide, which we shouldn't because it is often funny as she shows. Dogs are also funny, at least her ones are, and some of the funniest moments are about dogs, like her dog that pretends to be "situationally quadriplegic" when it comes time to leave the dog park. I recommend this book for those who've had depression or who want to understand it, because she writes about it in a way that is clearer than any medical faq on the internet. Her crude self-portrait is expressive in ways that a more detailed drawing would obscure. If you're a fan of sarcasm and hyperbole, you will love Hyperbole and a Half.
I noticed that some reviewers expressed discontent about how much of the book contained material that was already published on the blog, but from the description, I actually expected nearly all of the book to be re-used material with maybe a couple of new stories and fun book-only content. I was very pleasantly surprised to see that there is a good deal of totally new content. So, don't let that stop you from buying, especially considering the amazing price.<br/><br/>The quality is above and beyond expectations. Full color, super substantial pages, beautiful layout/design. Seriously, not buying this book is a crime. You should be imprisoned without trial if you do not buy this book. Without hyperbole.
I LOVE this book. I've never bought a book that had drawings on every page, but I bought it on a whim. I laughed so hard the first time I read it, that I kept it at my desk in my office at work. When I need a pick-me-up, I close my door and turn to (most) any page and laugh out-loud. I actually try to laugh more quietly, but sometimes I just have to let it out. I'm sure there are a few people whose offices are near mine, that wonder about the sustained cackling that comes out of some weird lady's office. Allie's take on anything she observes is so clear, true and funny, I am sure there are many readers like me who can relate and enjoy the ride at the same time. Of course I had to give it 5 gold stars!!
This book is a hilarious and poignant (I've always hated that word but it fits) glimpse into the world of a smart, funny woman who happens to be dealing with major depression. Her descriptions of the "ups" in her life made me laugh hysterically and her descriptions of the "downs" reminded me that I'm not alone (and made me want to send Brosh a big encouragement cake). If you've ever suffered from depression, there's a good chance you'll want to shout, "YES! That 's it exactly!" multiple times while reading. I finished the book in a weekend and couldn't stop making people read parts of it. There's a reason she has so many online readers and I can't wait to see what she does next.
From her start up blog to this book, Brosh delivers amazing content. From illustrations to her fantastic literary style, this book is a must buy for anyone whether you have read "Hyperbole and a Half" before or not. It is a half baked series of short stories and random writings bound in one place for your amusement. She takes an interesting approach at observing ones own awkward tendencies and dealing with the mire of society through the mind of an individual battling with herself. Her topics may border the cusp of dark and depressing at times, but her style of writing incites laughter in the most awkward of places and times. Oddly enough, that is her goal. I look forward to more of her work.
I love Allie Brosh's writing. Her unique way of seeing the world, paired with her self-deprecating sense of humor, is a joy to encounter.<br/><br/>I was disappointed that some of my favorite stories from Allie's blog weren't included -- particularly stories from her childhood, such as "Wolves," "The Scariest Story," "My Childhood in Pictures," "How A Fish Almost Ruined My Childhood," "The Year Kenny Loggins Ruined Christmas," "Menace," and "Allie Starts Her Moon Time."<br/><br/>I can only hope that Allie will publish a second book that includes these stories. It's not enough just to read them on the web. They are the kind of stories I want to include on my bookshelf, and read over and over again.
I have been following Allie's blog for a few years now, so I knew what to expect. And I was not disappointed! Even if I'd already read some of the stories in here before, they STILL make me laugh like a lunatic. Her insight into her depression is also like shining a light on my own, because those particular chapters feel like I could have written them. They made me cry, I'm going to be honest. I only wish the story about Kenny Loggins ruining Christmas had been included, because that was the first story of hers I had read.<br/><br/>All in all, 'Unfortunate Situations' is a fantastic read, whether you've been reading the Hyperbole blog, or are looking into Allie's brain for the first time.
I loved the mix of new and old material in this book.  I'm so happy to have some of my all time favorites in book form-- now I am prepared for the next power outage!<br/><br/>I read this as soon as I got the package and made the mistake of not taking breaks between chapters.  I laughed so hard I made myself dizzy.<br/><br/>I was thrilled with the quality off the book and the printing and wish I could think of something clever to write that would encourage undecided folks to buy this book.<br/><br/>Edited to add: This book has magical powers.  I said I was ready for a power outage and the universe took me up on the offer.  Our power went out not long after I wrote the original view. :)
Given as a present to my adult daughter and we read it to each other on a road trip. Great fun!
I've been following the website for awhile, so it was great to get this in book form! I guess some people were expecting it to have more stories from the website? I was just happy to get new stories! The goose one had me in TEARS. Allie Brosh has a great sense of comedic timing and pacing. The MS paint style drawings add character to it all. They're actually pretty expressive for how simple they are! I just can't image these stories being illustrated differently. If you're new to Hyperbole and a Half, I recommend starting with the website. Read some of the "Best of" stories and then decide if you want to make the book purchase. If you're already a fan - you need to get this book!
9 pages in, I was laughing so hard I cried. I love that each section is color coded, so I can find my place really easily. The drawings and the stories are hilarious, and definitely worth the read! I love Allie Brosh's blog, and am so pleased that her book was equally good and hilarious. I feel like Allie and I could have been best friends, I feel like she's telling stories about me... and that's probably why it's so funny, because she's really easy to relate to, and really down to earth.<br/><br/>If you want a fun book, something maybe to stick on the back of the toilet for some light reading... this book is fabulous! Also a great gift idea for someone with an awesome sense of humor.
Depression done real. There are many excellent books that depict a difficult life.  This is one is of the best. Because her graphic narrative is so accessible, evocative.  Because when you sense your mood descending and the demon is threatening, you are drawn to her.  At times like that it’s too much work to trudge through difficult poetry.  Depression for any individual person is it’s own special hell, but it’s helpful to know that she is the cell next door.  It’s like she understands. She doesn’t judge.  Family members and health professionals trying to comprehend your situation can get a glimpse of what you are experiencing, and maybe also be less judgmental, more able to support.
If you love Allie's blog, read this book.  If you have an imagination, or retain a remnant of what was once your childhood wonderment, read this book. If you believe that even the most painful of personal setbacks can (and should) be peppered with a sense of humor, READ THIS BOOK!<br/><br/>Now, for the haters... I'm talking about the people who live under a rock and gave this book poor reviews because of its wasteful use of color, foul language, weight vs. size ratio, sophomoric tones and drawings a 10 year old could do, YOU HAVE MISSED THE POINT ENTIRELY!  Enjoy the humidity of your mineral roofed substrate while perusing the pages of Grapes of Wrath and leave the laughing to us.
After being a longtime reader of the Hyperbole and a Half blog, I was very much looking forward to the release of the book. Some of the stories are familiar from the website, some of them are new, and all of them are presented fantastically.<br/><br/>Whenever I crack open this book, I find myself chuckling quietly in a corner. And then having to explain myself to whoever else is in the room. And then having to forfeit my book for a good long while, so they can read the story as well. At which point I must snatch the book from their hands and beat them over the head with it, in order to get it back (a sidenote - the book is hefty enough for said beating, which is always a bonus).
When I was introduced to Brosh's website by a friend, I immediately loved it.  It's not the sort of thing I ordinarily would read (I'm a guy and my taste tends toward classic literature), but there is something both endearing and hilarious about her work.  I ordered the book and had no idea what to expect.  Let me tell you, she outdid herself.  The book is divided into independent skits, short stories, or what-have-you.  Some are from the website, but even these take on a new quality when presented in print.  The range of emotion and humor that Brosh can convey through her seemingly childlike drawings is nothing short of astonishing.  Even the dark episodes are simply captivating.
Buy this book if:  1) You want a good laugh; 2) You admire a great cartoonist; 3) You are depressed and feel alone or know someone who is depressed and wonder why; 4) You already read Hyperbole on the internet and want more); and, what hit me hardest, 5) the final chapter.  I identified with most of the book (I have depression and an uncontrollable dog), but Chapter 5 told me that my darkest feelings are not unique,that maybe they are just a symptom of depression, not my true self.  Thanks, Ms. Brosh (I was raised in Virginia so I can't just call you Allie).  Your internet stories showed an honest view of depression, and your last chapter was so revealing it brought me to tears.
I laughed so hard that I almost cried. In both her blog and her book, Allie Brosh does an excellent job of sharing hilarious, and sometimes tragic moments of her life. Her childhood and dog stories make me LOL (literally), while her descriptions of what it's like to live with depression give amazing insight. My only complaint was that it was too short, and I think it could have used another chapter or two. That might have brought it down to 4 stars. But I enjoyed the stories and quirky illustrations so much that I'll still give it 5 stars. If you're not sold, download the first chapter on your kindle for free, and try it out. Or sneak into a bookstore. You'll be glad you did.
Insightful, hilarious, and fun - this book was a joy to read. Definitely get the actual book, rather than the kindle version, as the book is composed of colored drawings, just like the author's blog. Though this was a really quick read (the book is basically a gathering of cartoon-style annotated drawings), it was well worth the money. I read the book over a couple of evenings as my husband watched tv and I'm sure I was really annoying to him, as I kept laughing out loud and insisting on showing him pages from the book that were particularly hilarious.<br/><br/>Some of the book is repeated from the blog, but a large part of the material is new. It was well worth the price!
I love the blog. I love the book. I read it all as soon as the package arrived. Very awesome.
Brosh's debut novel, a collection of internet published pieces, is one of the most unusual books I've come across. It's a cry for help as she details her history of psychological battles with depression and tells stories from her childhood to recent events that show that Brosh's methods for dealing with stress aren't always successful.<br/><br/>The amusing parts of the graphic-novelish book detail her dogs, and these are hilarious.<br/><br/>The not-so-amusing parts have to do with her depression, and her inability to relate to the world.<br/><br/>I admire Allie Brosh for sharing her world with the public, and hope this helps other people understand depression better.
Seriously, just read this book. It's worth all of the glowing 5-star reviews it's been given. The material here ranges from hilarious and insightful (why do dogs operate by their horrifically-flawed logic?) to disturbing but still humorous (Allie's experiences with depression and her analysis of the workings of her identity included). My only complaint was that the book was not long enough -- not because the book is truly short but because it's so good, you just want more and more. (Guess I'll have to go to the website, huh?)<br/><br/>If you like the kind of introspective and uproarious stuff that The Oatmeal comes up with, give Hyperbole and a Half a shot. Allie rocks!
This memoir is a series of short graphic pieces, ranging from light-hearted topics surrounding her dogs, to more serious ones, such as her battle with depression. There were times where I laughed out loud, particularly with the descriptions of her two challenging dogs, and there were times where I was incredibly moved by her descriptions of her depression and her recovery. I loved reading about some of her childhood obsessions, which reminded me of how differently our minds work as a child. I highly recommend this book to anyone who was "different" as a child, has dogs, or has dealt with the demons of depression, either directly or through friends or loved ones.
I almost never laugh out loud, but this book made me laugh out loud.  I love Allie Brosh's work.  I bought this book at full price because I wanted to support her and brick-and-mortar book stores.  Oh, and I can relate scarily much to her writing about motivation and shame. If anyone finds a solution, they should let us all know!  Oh and she said the decision to be a cartoonist instead of a scientist was a bad one.  Well, I chose to be a scientist of sorts (computer), and I wish I were a cartoonist.  And I haven't published a book or made millions of people laugh.  Or make a smaller-number-but-still-a-lot of people feel less alone and less weird.  Thanks Bad Decision!
Have you ever experienced depression?  Ever been able to express the journey down and back? Me neither - but Allie Brosh can. With cartoons as a bonus!  Were you a weird kid?  Me too. So was Allie. This book is dog-intense and hilarious because of it. My daughter latched onto this book when she was six and started calling it "the swear word book".  She laughed at the simple dog's coping mechanism and as an inside joke will spontaneously go "oooooo eeeeeee boop boop boop". Does that make her weird and me a bad parent?  Absolutely. But she knows how the @&$@@#¥#¥% world works. Read this book. Keep it away from your children or they will ask WAY too many questions.
I laughed so hard that I cried while reading “Hyperbole and a Half.”  The author takes regular scenarios, like moving to a new state with a dog or procrastinating about returning a movie, and makes them hilarious.  People who want to get a preview of the book can visit the author's blog (same name as the book title).  Read the posts randomly, or look for a section running down the right side about the most popular posts.  The book contains material not found on the blog.  After becoming a fan of the blog, I bought the book. Then I became a fan of the book and bought a copy for my sister, who has a great sense of humor.
I read this while on vacation in Vegas with a friend by the pool (very quick read, and hadn't read these yet on her blog) and my friend made me sit further away from her on the chaise lounges because I was laughing out loud too hard.<br/><br/>The goose story and simple dog stories are the funniest (oh and the cake one, lmao) among many others, and the ones about coping with depression, while serious, can also bring a smile to the face and some kind of relief to someone who struggles with similar feelings often, that they're not so quite alone.<br/><br/>100% do recommend. Cannot wait for her next book next year.
I purchased this book for my SO after having read one of these comics online and found it hilarious. When this book arrived, we both were excited to read it. Perhaps I was a little too excited as I read this entire comic book in two sittings well before my SO even had a chance to pick it up to read.<br/><br/>I picked up the hard cover version of this book for less than $10. Each page is really thick but of excellent quality and all of the images look as they should. Feels like a really good quality book so it was a great deal for the price.<br/><br/>I absolutely recommend this comic book, it is hilarious. 10/10
I'm an avid reader of Allie's blog, so I bought this book as soon as I was able to, and I was not disappointed. It has many of the best blog entries as well as some new material, all of it extremely funny and real. I only wish that the Procrastinator post had been included, because it's one of my favorites, but considering all the other great entries we got, I won't complain. Also, the quality of the book is really nice! It's all in glossy paper and the printing and coloring looks amazing. It's a must have for all of Hyperbole and a Half fans, and for anyone who enjoys good humor (and drawings made with Paint)!
This is a wonderful book. Creative, charming and funny while still managing to portray what experiencing depression is actually like. The drawings are as wonderful as the writings in telling it like it is.<br/><br/>I look forward to her depression part 3 where she expresses even more of this torturous mood disorder. Who else could make loathing the past, dreading the future and despising the deadly present palpable? She made this disgusting mental state less shameful and ugly.<br/><br/>The book offered a way to generously share this dark season with others when I need them to understand and just let me be.
I love Allie Brosch. I really appreciate her description of the struggle with depression. I would recommend it just on that merit alone, but wish more of her comic stories had been included. Fortunately, "The God of Cake," "The Party," as well as, "Simple Dog," are included.<br/><br/>Fair warning: my daughter and I laughed 'til we cried, and most I've shared with laughed out loud more than once, but my husband asked, "is this supposed to be funny?"  With Allie B., you either think she's hilarious, or you don't get it. Also, although she is very intelligent and a bit of a grammar snob, she swears alot (sic.)
I've never read her blog so I didn't really know what to expect and I purchased based on reviews alone.  Being a dog lover I laughed out loud at Simple Dog and Helper Dog.  But the chapters that moved me the most were the ones about Depression.  I've never read anyone who better expressed the overwhelming nothingness of lasting depression.  So yes, I laughed, I cried, and I highlighted many passages that I identified with, all in the same afternoon.<br/>And did I mention the crude drawings peppered throughout? I don't understand the critical reviews regarding her illustrations.  They made the book for me.
I have laughed to I cried while reading Allie's website. She's is such a talented humorist and illustrator. When I saw she had a book out, I wasted no time ordering it. My teenage daughter and I are both fans. We have our favorite chapters and we read them out loud to each other. I think I can use some chapters (but not all) in my middle school classroom too. Caution - there is some foul language in the book so you have to be careful if you're buying this as a gift. I love how the book has lots of colored paper...each chapter is a different color. I've never seen such a wonderfully funny and colorful book!
If you're not familiar with Allie Brosh you must first check out her website Hyperbole and a Half", then and only then will be know what's in store when you buy this book. She continues to be the FUNNIEST, MOST DARING, [insert other generic praises here], etc., that ever picked up a pencil and sketch book. She's not afraid to tell the truth (or hyperbolize it), and spares no expenses getting the reader to laugh, cry, and make facial contortions that only begin to personify the experience you'll have with this book. If you do get it, it's very fun to read aloud to others (or yourself for that matter).
I love this book so much that I bought two more for gifts. I could not stop laughing throughout the book. If you have ever suffered from depression, to any degree, you will completely relate to this book. It's the things we say in our heads and she has put it into words and hilarious artwork. I need to buy some other merchandise that goes with this book. I  has a little swearing in it so if you're worried about that should you want to read it or give as a gift (which I completely recommend reading it first)  If I could give this more stars I would. So let's just say that it is off the charts fabulous!!
Allie made me laugh out loud. Her cartoons are hilarious and I love how much emotion she portrays with such little detail. I absolutely loved it and the section on depression was extremely helpful. I've had depression for years and it is so hard to find a way to explain it to people-especially those who want to help but really don't know how. The two chapters on depression should be added to psychology textbooks. Aside from that, her stories are so entertaining. She is refreshingly honest about herself and I just wish there was more to read.
This is a very quick read, but that does not make it any less enjoyable. Allie Brosh shares her life through her writing and quirky art work. Her art work speaks as clearly as her writing and brings a quick smile or laugh.  I appreciate the honesty Ms. Brosh shares in dealing with her depression; so clear, so accurate, from the heart. Lest you think this is a "downer" of a book, I would like to say that I laughed through much of the book and have read it a couple of times already. I look forward to more books from<br/>Ms. Borsh.
I really enjoyed it; it made me laugh, it made me think, and through at least three-quarters of the book I was thinking "I can totally relate to that!"  (The other quarter was equally enjoyable, reading about all the bizarre and humorous situations Brosh finds herself in) I'd recommend this book to anyone, but maybe to at least a teenage or older audience, as there is some strong language sometimes. The illustrations are great, the book goes really fast- in fact, that was the biggest disappointment,that it was over too soon.
Allie Brosh is my favorite person to ever put words together on the internet. Now she is my favorite person to ever put words together in book format. If you like her Hyperbole and a Half blogspot, you'll enjoy reading this book. Be warn, some stories are taken directly from her blog, but there's plenty of new stuff. This book is great introduction into her art and writing style for those who aren't familiar with her blog. And for those you are familiar with her blog, you don't need a review; you already know this s***'s hilarious.
I loved this book so much that I bought a second copy and sent it to a friend of mine as a "just because" gift. Usually we send treats, but since we're on that whole "healthier lifestyle" thing, this was a great "feel good" gift alternative to brownies. The stories are outlandish and humorously captured in writing only to be taken to the next level of hilarity by the drawings that accompany them. Allie Brosh is an incredible storyteller and truly captures complex human emotion in both writing and drawings.
This book is great. The cartoons and humor remind me a little of Matt Groening's "Life in Hell" series from 30 years ago. I bought this book for my oldest daughter, but upon reading a few pages, demanded that I get first dibs on it. The vignettes on dogs were gut busting hysterical. The fact that our dog looks and behaves a lot like the ones in the book didn't help. Even the parts on depression were funny, especially for those that have encountered it in some form in their lives. I for one can't wait to see more from Allie Brosh.
This book literally changed my life. I hadn't left my bed in nine days, and then I read the two sections on depression and it made me laugh and cry and feel like I wasn't a lone weirdo.  I've since forced it on all my friends, loved ones, doctors, therapists, and fellow group therapy members as it's the most relatable piece I've ever read on chronic depression.  A freaking hilarious, thoughtful, and  delightfully illustrated recount of battling chronic depression.  If it was possible to give it a gazillion stars I totally would.
This is a truly funny/ridiculous book, made more charming by the completely hysterical illustrations. Hyperbole: "exaggerated statements or claims not meant to be taken literally". Book Cover: "Hyperbole and a Half - unfortunate situations, flawed coping mechanisms, mayhem, and other things that happened"  Someone said, "It was honest, poignant, and ridiculously silly in all the best ways, and I'm better for having read it." Author, Allie Brosh, I have never seen a book quite like this - - - you did good!
I've only read a few "chapters" of this book, but I am in love with it.  It is so funny.  The illustrations are hilariously simple and the sentiments are so easy to relate to.  The book is great as you don't have to sit down and read the whole thing.  It is like as book of short stories.  It is very simply and casually written and really feels like Allie is just having a friendly, and entertainingly illustrated, conversation with the reader.<br/><br/>I am looking forward to reading the rest of the stories in this book.
I have been reading Allie's blog forever, and I especially love her illustrations. But she's been absent writing this book, so I haven't had my Hyperbole and a Half fix for a long time. I preordered this book and it's all Allie. Her illustrations are hysterical, and the text is awesome too. She tells stories about her childhood and about her dogs-just everyday events-but makes them so amusing. It cheers me up to read them. I highly recommend this book. If you're a fan, you'll be in heaven, and if you're not, you'll become one.
Allie Brosh is one of the funniest writers and illustrators I've seen in years. This book is a pure delight -- especially if you like dogs! Her drawings are strange and wonderful, and her stories are very personal, sometimes outrageously funny, and sometimes moving. I've given it as gifts already (to those who share my sense of humor). Check out her web site, too!  (Just Google Hyperbole and a half. I can't remember the site exactly.) She continues to update it with new drawings and stories. Waiting eagerly for her next book!
Hilarious!!  If you have children or remember what it was like to be a kid, you will not only appreciate her stories about her childhood, but will truly laugh out loud! Her stories about dogs are just as funny. All pet owners should be able to relate. On a serious note, she also shares her bouts with depression, in a brave way that still allows her humor to shine through. So if you are a pet owner with a dry sense of humor who has kids or remembers being a kid, and who sometimes struggles to get out of bed, this is for you!
Okay sure, some of them are available online in her blog. Does that make them any less amusing? Nooo. It was great reading the stories I already loved in a new format. Sometimes you just like holding a book, you know? Her new stories are just as funny, and it was great having new ones to read after so long, especially for that price. Yes, the book is bigger than expected, and it's heavier than it looks, but it's on high quality color paper, it's thicker and durable, but still portable for (e.g.) road trips/random whatevers.
As a guy, it might be considered odd to order this book. But, I did, and I'm glad I did. It's a great, quick read, and worth every single penny. I read about half of it in the morning, and the rest in the evening in the same day. I'm going to loan it to a few friends and read it again when it gets back around to me. It's funny, inspirational, and I had a smile nearly the entire time reading it that I absolutely could not wipe off.<br/><br/>Great read. If you're even considering this book, just buy it and enjoy. Seriously.
Loved most of the dogs' stories and the fact that the book touches on pretty deep issues such as depression and humanity's fallen nature. I think the opportunity was missed to explain why will never be good enough and what to do about it.  I can't say reading this book was a waste of time but it did fall short in my opinion. It was funny but not too funny.  It also had serious topics related in a funny way but they didn't come across either way.
Great book. Allie Brosh writes from the heart about various periods in her life but adds her great sense of humor and unique introspection to them, making the book a fun read but also something you'll be thinking about long after you're done.<br/><br/>The book is short and can be finished in a single sitting if one is so inclined, but it's still worth purchasing as the stories within are worth sharing with friends and revisiting later.<br/><br/>I hope to see more material from Allie soon. My wife and I are avid fans.
If you've never heard of Hyperbole and a Half, WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU???<br/><br/>No, seriously. Have you been hiding under a rock? Allie Brosh is a literary GENIUS and highly skilled artist (and by "highly skilled" I mean she draws the most absurdly hilarious illustrations to go along with her stories). Highly skilled, people.<br/><br/>Do you want to laugh? Do you want to cry (from laughter)? Do you want to crap your pants? Then you NEED Hyperbole and a Half. (The crapping of your pants is optional)
I really enjoyed this book! It is really interesting to read. It was the first graphic novel I have read and found it a nice change from my usual selection of books.  It was long, yet the pictures made it go by fast. Although it is a graphic novel, it definitely is not a kids’ book. I would recommend it to ages 15 and up because of adult topics and some swearing. I think both boys and girls would enjoy this book because it has very little to do about being a woman and mostly just focuses on the struggles of being human.
Okay, maybe that's a bit of a hyperbole, but that's what this book calls for, right?<br/>Allie Brosh shares never-before-seen content in the style of her world-famous "Hyperbole and a Half" blog, as well as a selection of her fans' favorite stories from her site.<br/>Ever wonder how Allie would tackle a home invasion by wild waterfowl? What her childhood experiences with mother-daughter outdoor bonding were like? Now you can find out!<br/><br/>Definitely has "Alot" of good content...though no Alots.
I've been a fan of Allie's blog for years, and was delighted to see new content along with the old favorites in her first book.  Her writing style is exemplary and her artwork fantastic, and, as expected, she had me both laughing and crying.  It's a beautifully-made book, too;  the pages are thick and glossy.<br/>Allie is brave to share her sometimes challenging life story and I admire her courage and her ability to laugh at herself and her life; her gift to me, a stranger, is that she helps me do the same with mine.
A number of the comics are from the website, but there is enough new material to make this book worth purchasing for your enjoyment (that is, you get value for your money beyond supporting the author). The book is heavier than I expected because the pages are high quality paper and each page has a color background. The binding is kind of tight, so it is work to keep the book open. I have been lending my copy to friends and someone new always sees it on my desk and starts reading when the book is returned.
Some chapters of this book were hilarious and had me laughing out loud. However, as the book went on it became too much of the same thing and it sat on my desk for about a month and a half waiting for me to read the last few chapters. I finally powered through them and they were by far the weakest, which, being freshest in my mind, knocked a star off of my rating. And just an FYI I went into this book never have hearing of the blog, so I didn't go in with a preconceived notion of how I'd feel about it.
This is laugh out loud funny. Recommended for anyone needing a lift.
This is one of the funniest books I have ever read, and one of the most relatable. I have no idea how she managed to explain depression in such a relatable way. As someone who has struggled with that issue myself and being unable to explain how I was feeling, it was such a relief to be able to give people this book to read and have that be my explanation. I have already let a few people borrow this book (or, really, I forced it upon them) and they have all loved it too. Keep up the amazingness Allie!
If you're not familiar with Allie Brosh yet, you should be.  Her blog is one of the greatest things to ever exist on the internet, and this book is a paper copy and extension of the high-quality content there.  She is bravely honest about difficult topics and tells the funniest tales about her childhood, her dogs, and life.  The book is extremely well made with vibrant colors and a strong binding.  Entertaining and deeply meaningful, you should buy a copy of this book for every single human you know.
If you have any doubts about this book, just check out her blog at hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com, and if you don't like it- don't get this.  I loved Allies take on a wide variety of topics from intimately personal to the idiosyncrasies of dogs, and the unorthodox art really gets at the heart of these things.  I would have been tempted to get this probably even if there wasn't new material (which there was- which is great), but that wasn't a problem.  A very unique and heartfelt book worth your time.
Which I think reflects more on my expectations and preconceptions of picking up a book I found without recommendations from trusted sources; as I often find a lot of duds when faced with the vastness of e-books.<br/><br/>This book was just what I needed right now, a curious look into an interesting mind of a fellow human. Experiencing things completely different than myself yet strangely relatable in other cases. Thank you for making this, it's wonderful to feel connected without ever having met.
would have done 4.5 if that was possible - still...<br/>a spectacular book.  1-2 misses, which ignores that there are 12-13 hits.  Allie is a frigging genius, especially at driving straight home to why you and everyone else in this tragicomic human species can all relate in her perfectly worded, haphazardly-yet-accurately drawn cartoons can show.<br/><br/>Get it.  Why?  Because it's effen funny, and that's worth something these days.  And you might learn something about yourself in the process.
I read most books on my iPad these days but this seemed like one I'd want in hard copy. And I was right. It's more fun to flip through and is a better way to appreciate the flow of the drawings (I think). Brosh and I are around the same age so that may be a factor in why I find her writing so funny and can relate to it so much. Her description of her depression is insightful and emotional while still imparting her humor throughout. It's this kind of writing that makes the entire book so enjoyable.
Peculiar thing I noticed when reading the book. It was as if I was reading it through A multi-faceted prism. Viewed it one way and I split a gut laughing; viewed it another way and the suffering is incomprehensible; and still another way left me with a profound understanding of mental illness; more than a college course on the subject would ever have taught me.  Two of my daughters were here today and saw me reading the book and immediately put in their dibbs for for being the next one to get it.
I bought this after being a fan of the online blog for some time now.  Was surprised at the addition of some new articles in the book that were not available online.<br/><br/>The only thing I didn't like was that some of the pictures were different in the book than what were online and I didn't like them as much as the online ones.  That kind of detracted a little from the story.  I feel the pictures really make the story and some of the exagerations in the pictures make the story a done deal.
A wonderful book filled with happy, sad and laugh out loud moments.
I am always amazed by Borsh. I followed the blog for a long time, pre-depression examination, and like everyone else, found the openness and self-awareness of those blogs (chapters) refreshing and confronting in all the right ways. She hasn't disappointed here, with a return to all the best old stuff, and some great new material.<br/><br/>And Allie, if you ever read this, you aren't the only one with the machine.<br/><br/>All those "nice" people you compared yourself to have them as well ;)
I love Allie. I love her website. I love her drawings. I love her stories. They make me laugh so hard I cry. This book was highly anticipated by me for the MOAR STORIES! And having some of the most popular from the blog is great too as then it's even easier to share them with people in real-life. Buy this book to support her and then read it to support yourself because laughter.<br/><br/>tl;dr ALL THE POSITIVE THINGS!<br/><br/>THANKS ALLIE I LOVE YOU YOU DID AWESOME. I. AM. IN. AWE. OF YOU!
I've followed Allie Brosh on the web for a few years, and I snagged this as soon as it was out.<br/><br/>I knew it would be funny and sweet and full-throated. That's who Brosh is. One thing I didn't expect is how beautiful the actual physical object would be.<br/><br/>I will tell you as a very long term severe depressive, Brosh's Depression 1 and especially Depression 2 brought tears to my eyes and laughter to my heart.<br/><br/>Remember this: The fish are always deadest before the dawn.
Absolutely, totally, awesomely brilliant.<br/>  Not only laughing-out-loud funny, but poignant: Ms. Brosh's insights into her own depression helped me to recognize that my totally paralysis and numbness in the wake of a beloved sister's death was not just unbelievable laziness, as in "cannot get out of bed except to get a snack and/or go to the bathroom," but possibly a symptom of the worst depression I've ever experienced.<br/>  Then again, maybe it WAS just unbelievable laziness.
After reading it, I bought some copies for friends at Christmas. This was one of those books for me that when something made me laugh i couldn't stop. The more you read, the more you have to put it down because youre laughing so hard. The narration and the art really compliment each other and hit you right in the funny guts. It's one of those great things that can take you everywhere with it and you always want to see what's next.<br/><br/>I don't know who would like this. I liked it.
A book of crude drawings and simplistic comments about trivial events in a person's life. Sounds exciting, doesn't it? ACTUALLY, I loved it!! The random meandering of Allie's mind accompanied by cutesy drawings were fun, humorous and even thought provoking. I hadn't heard of her blog but decided to read the book because it sounded interesting. I am a bit worried about her self image though, because based on the drawings, she seems to think she is some sort of mutant fish-like creature.
I've been a follower of Allie's blog for years. I rarely pre-order books, but was excited enough about this to do so, and it didn't disappoint. Some of the stories were the same as I'd seen on the blog, but about half of the book was new material. This book would be worth it for the funny memoir stories; it is stellar because of the honest and emotional and hilarious take she has on dealing with depression in two of them. Check out her blog; if you like it at all, you'll love the book.
If you are not familiar with Allie Brosh, this will be a good introduction.  I absolutely adore her writing and have been following her blog of the same name for a while now.  The artwork is also hers and is as much a part of the stories as the words.  Her wry wit and sometimes dark observations of the world and herself had me thinking she had been reading my own diary, except mine isn't so funny!  I envy anyone who is reading her stuff for the first time, they are in for a real treat!
Allie Brosh has stolen my life and written about it as if it were hers.  Oh, sure, she cleverly disguised it by changing the cats into dogs, but don't let that fool you!  I thought I was the only one who motivated myself through a ritualized mix of fear and shame, so it is obvious that she has been spying on me for a very long time.  If she weren't so dang funny, I would be calling my lawyers right now.<br/><br/>Allie, I love you to pieces.
When a friend recommended Allie Brosh I read it with "no expectations". And boy, she tears apart human behaviour like nobody has done it before. All of it with a funny and whacky sense of descriptions and sketches. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys the process of decoding human behaviour and can spot themselves in characters. I thoroughly enjoyed the part on "I am so humble....are humble people supposed to say this" ROFL
I have loved Allie Brosh's work ever since I found her on the internet. She is a kindred spirit. This book makes me laugh out loud in places which is a good thing for someone who has lived with clinical depression/bi-polar I for 35 or so years. You don't have to be depressed to love her drawings and hilarious stories. Her chapter on depression is the best explanation I have found to describe what it's like to be me. I hope she writes more.
This book was recommended to me by one of my students, and I was sucked in immediately, mostly because I could really (fortunately or unfortunately) see myself in a while lot of the situations and thought processes, which should probably disturb me a hell of a lot more than it does. The writing style is approachable and charming, and the illustrations are primitive and fantastic. I highly recommend the book to pretty much everyone I know.
Allie's sense of humor and wit in describing how she deals with her disorders is highly entertaining, hilarious and also enlightening.  The reader is left with a better understanding of those that think the way the author does.  Her stories about her dogs were so funny I can just read them over and over again.  Her cartoon style can best be described as quirky, but they perfectly depict anecdotes as she describes them.  I loved this book!
This book isn't just laugh-outloud funny.  It's laugh so hard you'll slide out of your chair and tear up funny!<br/>If you follow the author's blog, you'll be pleased to find plenty of all-new stories and a few old favorites in the book.<br/>If you're new to Hyperbole and a Half, you are in for a real treat!  Allie Brosh is an incredible story teller.  The book is funny, honest, and poignant.<br/><br/>I hope she writes another soon!!
It is okay to put this book down occasionally. Serious consequences may occur if you do not. Your laundry may pile up, your pets and loved ones may feel abandoned, and worst if all your face may crack in half from all the laughter. No one wants to see that. The sick and twisted and fans of her blog (same thing really) will enjoy this book. If you are not already aware that you are one of the above, flee now before you discover the truth.
There is so much that has been said about this book that there is nothing new I can add - except to say that it is truly outstanding and the reviews are not just hyperbole.  I have purchased at least six, probably more, copies of this book. I keep giving them away to friends who need the hope and humor that this book offers on a very serious subject. Allie is brilliant and so brave to share her stories with us.  And it is Wicked Funny.
Wacked-out, over-the-top, crazy, self-absorbed...I wish. The reality is that most of us harbour thoughts exactly like those of Allie Brosh. We mask them when and point fingers at Those People who admit to them. Brosh illustrates them and writes about them with such candid self-exploration I found myself alternately laughing and cringing.<br/><br/>Thanks for being so painfully honest, Allie Brosh. You made me laugh at my own flaws.
I read all of Allie Brosh's blog and was sad when she stopped writing it, but at least she only stopped so she could write some books. I love how expressive her drawings are and how insightful her observations about the way her mind works. As she describes her crazy thoughts in detail, you recognize your own thoughts. It makes you feel like a better person knowing that you are not the only one having those "crazy" thoughts.
Lovely little book.  I've been a longtime fan of Allie's blog, but I bought the paperback on impulse at the airport.  As an animal lover, the stories about her two dogs made me giggle uncontrollably, so much that the person sitting next to me on the plane sent miffed glances my way.  Some stories were laugh-out-loud funny, and some made me tear up a little.  I plan to keep this book on my shelf, and re-read in the future.
I am typing this out between having finished the Kindle edition in a single sitting and ordering a bajillion paper copies for everybody for Christmas.<br/><br/>There are plenty of funny people on the internet, but few have something really valuable to say.<br/><br/>There are plenty of smart people, but few manage to say their smart things in a way that doesn't take 532098 pages and is funny, straightforward and relatable.<br/><br/>Allie Brosh is possibly the singular person occupying the intersection of both. A sage relating the wisdom of the ages in funny drawings and simple sentences, Allie is the girl I wish I met in my late teens to validate that I am not, in fact, a friggin weirdo and if I am, then of the most lovable kind.<br/><br/>On top of that, she has the brutal honesty and utter disdain for convention of Sigmund Freud, saying unashamedly aloud what most people are too scared to even think to themselves, and to top it off, the looks of a supergigahyperomigoshbroshmodel.<br/><br/>This book is likely to turn Allie from a nachos-eating bum into a nachos-eating millionaire. I'm contributing as much as I can just to see how that turns out.<br/><br/>P.S. Marry me. Seriously, I mean it. I have fifty bottles of wine for the winter and a similar aversion to household maintenance. We can hire a maid or something. Europe is nice.<br/><br/>Our babies will be smart, beautiful, AND clinically depressed. Tought to beat that.
Long time fan of Allie' s blog and the book captured and magnified the blog's genius completely. She has a way of illustrating these existential human truths in the most simple, but profound ways. Also, the dogs are stupid adorable. Finally, the book ends on a spectacularly poetic note that made me so happy.<br/><br/>N.b. I read this on my Kindle Fire and the colors\pictures looked great. I have no idea how this measures up to the print version though.
Great comic-- love Allie. Sorry the review is lame, but there are so many good ones up already. I really just want to click the five stars and go back to my meager 1/2 hour lunch hour. Get the book. It's totally worth it.
This book is so incredibly cute, it’s incredicute.  Yep, I just made up a new word for it.  Err- I guess it’s actually a hybrid not really a new word…I think we’re getting off topic here.<br/><br/>If you’ve ever read the Hyperbole and a Half blog then you already know what to expect from this book and it definitely delivers.  Allie has a way of bringing humor to virtually any topic.  Whether it’s the mundane act of training a new dog or the darkest throes of depression, she somehow brings out the funny.<br/><br/>Her style is remarkably charming and relatable.  Even when it is focusing on topics that I don’t have much experience with firsthand, I could still identify with the way she processes it. In fact, her internal battles are some of the funniest parts.  I think everyone assumes that having an internal dialogue with yourself is somehow crazy, but we all probably do it.  Or maybe I am crazy.<br/><br/>The ms paint style drawings, while admittedly simple, are quite effective.  The range of emotions she can convey in these doodles is mindblowing.  If you’re looking at them dismissively-give it a minute, they will win you over.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that I have already seen many of these on the blog and was hoping for more new material. Also, it left out my absolute favorite:  How Kenny Loggins ruined Christmas.  It was my first taste of Hyperbole and a Half long, long ago and it still makes me laugh so hard I cry.  You should go read it, like now.
This book is fantastic. Everyone should read it. It combines humor with realism and makes you relate intensely to the author.
Brilliant.  Uncategorizable.  A work of genius that I am so grateful to have read, and reread, and keep next to my bed to read some more.  Allie Brosh has the best evocation of depression I have ever seen, and I love her for it--and for embedding it in the midst of the most charming, witty,  quirky, and hilarious illustrated tales.  I've already bought 3 copies and am about to buy 3 more.  Everyone should read this book.
Really good.  Underrated because it's not a writer who has connections and writes in a supposedly 'enlightened' manner (i.e., abstruse and chaotically angsty).  One of those works by an amateur who's just writing from her heart and creating an artistic composition that is both hilarious and heartfelt and just the right amount of wacky to be something we can all relate to.  Hilarious.  Quick read, but worth reading twice.
This book is written by a blogger who illlustrates her own work.  She has depression among other psychological issues.  Her story on her depression has made every depressed person I know say, That is how I feel.  Yet she nails it in a very funny way, which is very hard to describe.  This book is just an amazing read.  Check out her blog online if you don't want to buy the book outright.  "Hyperbole and a half."
I read Hyberbole and a Half online and when I found out there was a book I had to have it. I don't even mind that some are what has already been posted online. I love being able to pull this out whenever I am feeling down. I am also a bookaholic. So having a pyshical copy and not having to go online to find them is great!<br/><br/>The Depression section is also a great thing to show others who don't quite understand.
I laughed so hard I cried.  I cried so hard I laughed.  She caused me to evaluate myself in a completely new way.<br/><br/>Allie, if you're out these somewhere, reading this...your work has changed lives.  You are not alone.  Your willingness to share in your depression (un)adventure is incredible.  The reality is beautiful and so, so ugly all at once.  Wave that s*** around.  Your vulnerability and transparency is STRENGTH!
Perfect bathroom book.  I'm serious!  Those short chapters are just right for when you need a little something to read while getting down to business.  However, you may find yourself the recipient of some strange looks when you emerge...it's not often that uncontrollable laughter occurs in the powder room, but Allie's twisted sense of humor and adorably dorky illustrations make it difficult to resist giggling out loud.
Especially if you or someone you know has problems with mental health. I've been following this author's online work for years now, and her humor is impeccable. As someone with depression, it really spoke to me. I've never seen someone be able to explain depression in a way that not only makes sense, but also makes you smile. Allie Brosh is so incredibly relateable, and I'll enjoy reading her stories for years to come.
Fantastic! Allie Brosh describes the very instances from life that you yourself have experienced. She writes about her childhood with humor and lets you know just how quirky she was and still is. She talks about her equally quirky dogs and their adventures. I especially found her description of depression and how it affects you dead on. Hyperbole and a Half is relevant and funny and feels like your own life in print.
Her stories are from her life and they are so heartbreaking but so relatable and funny. Her art style is purposefully super-primitive and as a result it gives the whole book a very specific tone that adds so much. I was trying to read this in bed next to my sleeping boyfriend and I kept silently shaking the bed because I couldn't help how hard I was laughing, even when the stories are painfully sad.  It's brilliant.
Thick book and appears long, but I think it only took me a total of 4-5 hours to read. The section on Depression is extremely insightful. I have never heard/read a better explanation of the disease. My family has never understood why I was depressed and neither have I. This gave me some peace knowing that depression is not always a result of a tragedy, but a disease that can invade anyones life for no reason at all.
I love this book. Most of it is hilarious, but the parts that aren't still belong in with the rest. Allie Brosh is relateable and real. This has a good mix of old favorites and new stuff. Although I realize it's impossible because Im pretty sure she wrote the post after the book went to the publisher, I wish "Menace" was in here. I made all my friends read "Menace", and now Im going to make them all read this book.
One of the best descriptions of what it is like to have depression, in a pictorial no less! It is right up there with Andrew Solomon's Noonday Demon but a totally different presentation. Do  not let the seeming simplicity of the drawings mislead you, Allie is a classically trained artist and uses the most subtle of lines to show the most profound feelings.<br/>Cannot recommend it enough. Have given many as gifts.
I love the book, hilarious. I bought a second at a book store to give as a gift. I would have liked to see all new stories, as I've read a few of these on the blog, but still worth it. Just mad at Amazon for sending me a damaged first copy then forcing me to make an unnecessary trip to UPS! I will not purchase another book thru Amazon as they are not shrink wrapped, they just throw them in an envelope and send it.
This is so damn enjoyable. I plowed right through, giggling the whole way. The rudimentary drawings are so perfect. And there's so much truth in here. I'll be honest: I'm a therapist, and I've read sections to clients more than once in the last few weeks since reading this. The one called Thoughts and Feelings is my favorite, but when I think of the simple dog with shapes in the thought bubbles, I laugh instantly.
Book #80 Read in 2015<br/>Hyperbole and a Half by Allie Brosh<br/><br/>This book is extremely funny.  It is based on Brosh's blog and talks about such important things about the intelligence of her dogs, how to escape an angry goose in your house as well as actual serious issues such as depression.  These short chapters are entertaining and fun.  A fun summer read, I borrowed this book from the public library.
This is hands down the most awesome book ever. My friends get this book from me as a birthday gift. I bought a copy for myself and then one for my iPad. The author is incredibly funny and talented. Not all of the chapters elicit laughs and that's ok. Her piece on depression is spot on. A sign of a good piece of art is that you think about it often after you've experienced it. I definitely had that with this book.
I love Allie Brosh, and have followed her posts since her blog first started.  She has a knack for making people laugh at topics that are hard to discuss (such as depression).  This is not a comic book, to be clear.<br/><br/>You should read this book if:<br/>(A) You like dogs.<br/>(B) You or someone close to you has gone through depression.<br/>(C) A bunch of other reasons.  YOU WANT TO READ ALL THE THINGS!
I have been checking back each day for the last three days since I was notified that my copy of this book was indeed on its way toward my home, just to bask in the soft glow of everyone else's love for it. I understand this is a weird thing. But it is the truth. The book itself made me laugh (loudly, in fits) and at times reflect inward. Lost in the Woods maybe one of the funniest stories I have ever read. Ever.
This book is AWESOME. It's interesting. It's insightful. It's poignant, hopeful, desperate, pathetic, and at all times hilarious. I have read it twice through without stopping. She has a great way of writing about depression, self esteem, dysfunctional animals, weird childhood experiences, and weird adult experiences without underplaying any of the emotions OR being serious at any time. What more could I want??
This is a rare gem. A "feel good" book. I've been following the author for a some years. Her best work is on her site. What I love about her work is the honesty and freshness. We live in a world of having to stop being ourselves so we can "fit in".  Allie's stories take me to a world of self-honesty and just being ourselves. It's hard to explain.  I do hope you buy her book. You won't regret it.
It may very well be that you need a particular type of humor to fully appreciate this book, but for me, I will literally be brought to tears from laughter. It's gotten so bad I can't even skim the book in a book store without making a scene. Not even kidding, this book and the blog from which it came, just hit me in a way that I loose all self control and laugh so hard it hurts.<br/><br/>Buy it. Just do it.
This is a unique and brilliantly humorous book. I purchased it because I was at a low and needed something light-hearted and fun. This did the job and much of the serious notes resonated with me. I started reading her blog after finishing the book quickly. I think the author (and publisher) did a particularly great job of transitioning the work from blog to book.<br/><br/>I can't wait to read the next one.
I have been waiting for this book since Allie Brosh announced it on her blog. It is everything I wanted, and more. Packed with beautiful drawings, and I do mean packed, this book has original stories, previously unpublished, hilarious recountings of Ms. Brosh's life and times. She's bright, funny, and I love her brand of self deprecating humor. The drawings are brilliant!! ALLIE BROSH DELIVERS THE GOODS!!!
I have been a fan for a long time now.  No other author has made me laugh so hard and tear up so easily as Brosh.  Her honesty is amazing.  Whether it is her analysis of her dog, who is less than smart, or her clear description of her depression, her narratives will grab you and keep you reading.<br/><br/>If you haven't read her yet, I'm jealous that you get to read her work for the first time!  Enjoy!!!
Two of my daughters and one son are huge fans of Allie Brosh's blog, and so I got them this book.  It includes material from the blog, and presumably some other material.  The drawings are so absurd they're hilarious, as is her writing....letters she'd write back to her 8 year old self?  Priceless.  The pages are all different colors, which makes it very entertaining to simply flip through it.  Funny book.
Allie is, as always, charming in her blatancy, hilarious in her confessions, and unnaturally perspicacious when delving into not only her own psyche, but the psyches of those who follow her.  Anyone who can identify with Allie and her Simple and Helper Dogs will fall over themselves laughing, but will also appreciate her honest evaluation of her own frailties, no doubt finding common ground.  So worth it.
Gift for my 15 year old grandaughter and she loved it.
I have followed the author's blog for quite a time and have ben waiting for the "birth" of her book. My son bought it for me as a gift and I love it. Everything about it is wonderful. THe stories, the color graphics, the expressions on the faces, the wonderful humor she brings to things that are not even humorous. It is like "Diary of A Wimpy Adult" and it is just perfect for a fun read.
Allie Brosh makes all of us feel less weird. Her self-effacing humor is adorable and  her drawings so loveable and expressive! I especially love her stories about being a terrible kid, her broken dogs, and anything where her mom shows up with crossed arms, looking bewildered. This is a quick read, but something you can read more than once and still get a case of the giggles! I love Hyperbole and a Half!
Allie is amazing and has a really relateable outlook on life. I adore the MS Paint illustrations. I've been reading her blog for a long time and you can't help but come across some of her work on the internet as it's some of the most copied and misattributed stuff out there. I wish she could get credit for all of that, but I'm glad she made this book so it's clear who's genius ideas these comics are!
I'm only halfway through the book, and I've already cried from laughing so hard a few times. The stories are short, the pictures are funny, and even though I don't want to admit it- I totally relate to most of the "flawed coping mechanisms" that result in hilarity. Even if you're not reminded of yourself, you definitely know someone who fits the bill.<br/>It's hilarious. You need to read it.
I was so glad to get this when I did, because I was pretty bummed out in general at the time. Reading this book cheered me up immensely. I'm glad it features both new stories AND fave blog posts, because now I have some of my favorite posts in my hands whenever I want to read them, without the need of internet access. I love the illustrations so, so much. A definite fave book, I'm so glad it's mine.
I really liked this book for one reason, it inspired me to explore my mind and no matter how much it disappoints me, I'll keep on going through and through until I know the inner workings of my mind perfectly, so thank you, the author for inspiring me like this, and actually I'm just like you, a lazy bum sorta person who kinda goes through a loop of job, no job and actually I do own two dogs of my own so in retrospect, thank you for opening my mind to this exploration of my mind
So, it's kind of unfair for me to give this three stars, because that suggests that it isn't a good book, which it is. Humor is a subjective thing. I liked this book and I felt it was well done and also illuminating in many spots as to depression, etc. I just didn't find it very funny. I chuckled...once. But I know many will find this laugh-out-loud funny, it just wasn't hitting on my humor spots.
What can I say, Allie is hilarious. I especially liked the stories about her depression, which I found both amusing and comforting; these were incredibly accurate to my experience and many others' I know as well. I highly admire her for the way she makes issues like depression and social anxiety entertaining to her narrative but never demeaning or invalidating. Also her dogs are the s***. 5 stars
Contains a few of her all time best (god of cake), and a bunch of new stories which were more real than funny. Definitely glad I bought it to support Allie but I wish she had included a few more of her old stories (especially the one where she has to do a race in a very hot place and ends up wandering through a grocery store yelling juice) to balance out the more serious stories about depression.
Laugh out loud hilarious.  My dogs were completely freaked out by all the laughter, and didn't know what to do, so one of them peed on the carpet.  That stopped the laughing, but not for long.  Except for that one interruption, I read the whole book in one sitting.  Thank you for writing this book and sharing so many thoughts and feelings that I didn't know I had.<br/>The drawings are wonderful.
Allie did NOT disappoint with her first book! There were so much more new material than I expected and I loved seeing some old favorites. This would make a great gift for anyone with a quirky sense of humor.<br/><br/>One thing to note - I bought the hard cover thinking it would be a nice coffee table book, however it is the size of a standard novel so I was a bit mistaken. No complaints though!
I LOVE LOVE LOVE this book!! She captures amazing amounts of emotion in such (seemingly) simple drawing.  Having been a somewhat odd child myself, suffering bouts of depression and owning a "simple" dog too, I can really relate to her stories.  I can imagine there will be certain types of people out there that just won't get it bc they just can't relate.  I hope she writes/produces another book.
This is literally one of the funniest books I've ever read. The pictures are what send it over the edge. I got this in the kindle version and it was just as good as the paperback in the bookstore. Added bonus -- I could read it and laugh out loud in the dead of night and wake my girlfriend up and make her reread the chapter again while I laughed until I cried. Truly happened. Fantastic book!!
I've been a fan of Hyperbole and a Half for years, and while some of this is directly ripped from her blog, there are some stories that were new to me.<br/><br/>I easily read it in one or two sittings and I'm not going to lie -- I was laughing SO HARD in some parts that I may have peed a little. I highly recommend this book to everyone with a pulse. The story about the goose was the best.
I bought this book based solely on the fact that I had read the author's blog about depression, and it was the best and most realistic (and funny) view on depression I had ever read.  It helped me put my own depression in perspective and also helped me become aware when I finally found that little piece of corn under the refrigerator.  The rest of the book is witty and funny and delightful.
I've followed Allie's blog and watched it grow in quality, and I was excited for the book.  I bought it for my sister as a gift.  It includes some blog material and some new material.  As always, the drawings are adorable, especially the dogs, but sometimes Allie's stories of her current life are heart-wrenching.  It's a great collection that I recommend for anyone who is a fan of the blog.
Bought this for my dad last Christmas. He adores it.
*Spoiler free notice* - This is frajeakin' hilarious! This is literally the funniest book I've ever read. I've never laughed while reading a book before. The art is just as funny and telling as the writing. The characters facial expressions are creeping spot on hilarious! Simple dog ... I love that dog.... I want to meet Simple dog, is a funny @$$ dog. Beware the laughs of the goose story!
I purchased this book to keep on my coffee table and the size is a little more "novelish" than I would have thought.  I wish the pages were perhaps a little larger, with fewer pages as it's a little hard to hold and read without bending it a lot.  However, I LOVE Allie Brosh and her stories/drawings are hilarious.  That's just my small "wish" for an otherwise fabulous book!
If you're anything like me, you may spend hours on Amazon looking up products, comparing prices, and reading reviews to figure out if a particular item is worth spending money on.<br/><br/>Whatever sort of thing you're researching now is irrelevant. Stop what you are doing and buy this book.<br/><br/>Seriously.
I really loved this book.  It is heartfelt,true, funny, and I can completely identify.  The stories about her dogs are laugh out loud funny.  ( not too many books make me burst out laughing like that).  The drawings that acompany  each situation are so spot on.  The honesty about her depression really hit home.  Allie Brosh is a very gifted writer and illustrator.  Highly recommended.
I am an avid reader of Allie Brosh's blog, Hyperbole & a Half. She has a great sense of humor & her simple drawings combined with her writing creates an amazing blog.<br/><br/>I bought the book & read it in one day. Unfortunately I made the mistake of "borrowing" it to my family. I haven't seen it since, they love it so much! Looks like I'll have to grab myself another copy!
I am familiar with Allie's blog, so I bought this book right away.  It did not disappoint.  The new material is terrific, high standard Allie material and the old material is classic stuff I can read over and over.<br/><br/>I like to read anything from classics to comic books, and this fits somewhere in the middle.  One of the most hilarious and heartbreaking books you'll ever read.
Allie has given my wife and I plenty of laughs with her (free!) web series, so i was more than happy to pick this up. :)<br/><br/>If you're a fan, pick it up! There're several new strips inside, as well as a ton (all?) of her pre-existing stuff.<br/>If you've never heard of her before? Check out her website 'Hyperbole and a Half', enjoy what she's already posted, then buy this! :D
A great way to pass the time and have a few laughs.
The author did an excellent job of taking memories and emotions of mental chaos and blending them together with the bent humor we all feel but rarely express.  I laughed until I cried - mainly because I could relate - which is awkwardly relieving.  It's a crazy misunderstood world, but knowing others share similar reactions to life's experiences surprisingly helps keep one grounded.
I'm a big fan of her blog! :) I love the book! Reading her book is different from reading her blog online, but it's just as many laughs! The paperback version is smaller than I though it would be, but super thick with awesome stories, including new ones! I bought a copy for myself, but I've considered buying copies for my family because it's so funny and could brighten up their day.
I have been following Allie's blog every since the Alot posting, her work is amazing, and I went to a book signing that she spent at least 7 hours signing so that everyone that showed up could have a signed copy. On top of everything else she made a custom drawing for everyone that requested one.  Not only is the book hilarious, but the author seems genuinely nice.
I knew this was going to be amazing, but seeing the book, holding it, turning the pages...it's FABULOUS! I might even like reading the stories better in book form! crazy! I didn't expect the book to be so BIG! I loooooooove!! Allie Brosh's stories are hysterical. If you haven't read them, it's well worth $10 for the book, or spend a week reading everything online!
If you want to know what to expect from this book, just go check out the author's hilarious blog, Hyperbole and a Half. The book includes a few favorite posts from the blog--some now expanded with more detail and hilariously poignant pictures--and there are several all-new stories as well.<br/><br/>I love this book and hope Allie Brosh is making a killing on it.
I love this blog, and I love having some of it in book form. The author has a wicked sense of humor and insight, and the results are totally brilliant. The extremely crude illustrations nonetheless perfectly capture the topics in the text.<br/><br/>It's probably more fabulous as a blog than a book... but I am SO pleased to have most of my favorites in book form!
I used to work in an office doing billing (ugh!), and I would read this blog when I didn't feel like working (which was always). If you're in for a laugh, and some relatable stories with funny drawings to aid the telling...this book is for you. But maybe don't read it at the office, because your co-workers will definitely think you're crazy when you randomly LOL.
I bought this for a friend and read the first few pages out of curiosity...and now I'm addicted. I didn't get the Paint-characters at first but they are so appropriate for her stories. I'm currently halfway through her website and right after I read this review, I'm going to get the Kindle edition. Cannot wait to hear more from this author!! Absolutely hilarious.
Probably the funniest book I have ever had the pleasure of reading. (you should read it when you are alone... otherwise people stare at you when you burst out laughing for an unknown reason)<br/><br/>I bought the kindle edition and the hardback edition (which I loaned to a friend.... a year ago... and now thinking about buying another copy) Yes. Its that good.
As  therapist I found such insight with this book.  I will use it to help my client put to word what they are feeling and help them see they are not alone.  Further if you are a dog lover this book proved so much insight you the wonderful world of being an owner.  Finally if you just need to laugh, smile and generally relax this book provides all that and more.
I was unprepared for the journey Allie Brosh took me on. It was at turns horrifying, hilarious, shocking, and depressing - but it never failed to entertain. The subject matter is intensely personal, but the comical artwork disarms any anxiety that might keep me from reading on. It's an absurd, totally human piece of work. And I loved every single page of it!
I loved this book!  The deliberately primitive illustrations convey far more than you would think, and the stories are wonderfully, absurdly funny. (One exception is the two chapters where she talks about her debilitating bout with depression, which gave me great insight into what that must be like.)  I hope this is the first of a series of Allie Brosh books!
Allie Brosh captures complex emotions and the point of view of a child.  Her drawings are childlike and odd, yet convey rich meanings.  I particularly appreciate the way she illuminates the subject of depression.  Do not be turned off because of "cartoons."  This is a book of real substance.  It's pretty, too.  Just buy it.  And this is not hyperbole.
This is the funniest and most heartfelt book I have read in years.  My daughter told me to read it and I literally laughed till I cried. Her friend used it in speech class and the whole class burst into laughter. All dog lovers MUST get this book. Everyone who has had depression must get this book. Allie has such a way of phrasing things. Hang in there Allie!
I love this book!  I lend it out to all of my friends who can be trusted to return it (because I would be extremely upset if I didn't get this one back).  The comics are split up great so you can read one when you have 10 minutes free.  Or if you're like me (and apparently the author) and lack self-control, you can binge read the entire thing in one sitting.
A very quick and immensely enjoyable read, containing several lines and pictures that made me have to put down my tablet because I was cackling so hard I couldn't breathe or hold things.  Absolutely hysterical, well-written and illustrated.  A caution: this book may awaken an uncontrollable urge to purchase a toy parrot with which to torment your loved ones.
If you're thinking of ordering this book, I'm sure you already know how hilarious Allie and her blog are. Suffice it to say this book is amazing and had me in tears from laughter, even though I'd already read many of the chapters (entries?) online. Her new chapters are easily on par with what we've all read on her blog. I can't get enough of her dog stories!
I loved reading this blog and when I found out there was a book I simply squealed with joy. The moment I had it in my hands was happiness itself as I promptly began doing a dramatic reading for my parents and best friend. Allie is so easy to connect with on so many levels and the art and comics along with the comedic writing are enough to make anyone laugh.
Some stuff from her blog and some completely new stuff. Typical hyperbole and a half. I started reading it on the train and had to finally to put it down because I was doing that laughing so uncontrollably that I was crying, not making any noise, and making weird faces. And I almost peed my pants. Definitely worth whatever way too small a sum I paid for it.
I used to read her blog all the time and was excited to have a physical copy of her work. I have showed this to my friends and most of them think it is a hilarious depiction of life and want to buy the book. I would recommend it to anyone if you enjoy funny real-life stories. I would definitely buy any future books she would release. Read this and have fun!
This book was long anticipated in our household. We are readers and avid fans of the Hyperbole and a Half Blog, and well-wishers and supporters of the author, Allie Brosh. The book was as delightful as we expected, with material from the blog that we were familiar with as well as much new material. She and her book are delightfully funny and an inspiration.
The chapter about the dog, and Iq test was read out to my whole family, and we all giggled. Then proceeded to testing our animal...<br/><br/>Some chapters, are hilarious and light, some talk about depression, identity, and go quiet deep literally and figuratively.<br/><br/>Quick, light, but meaningful read. Awesome drawings once you get used to them :)
I have been reading Allie Brosh's blog for quite some time now and I was SOOOOOO excited when I found out that she was releasing a book. I had finally found myself in a position to reward my good studentry and all around awesomeness with something nice, so I bought myself this book! And I love it! Why wouldn't I?! Now it's your turn. Ready, set, GO!
This book was so funny I couldn't put it down.  I bought copies for my friends and now we use the author's "dog language" sometimes when we get together such as ' "Thing?  What is Thing?", and "No legs, sorry, can't home."  Fabulous book.  Thank goodness.  It had been far too long since I read a book that wasn't annoying in some predictable way.  The author is so self-absorbed but in a non-arrogant way; she sees the funny things in the average experience.  It's hilarious I love this book!!!!!  I hope she write another one, soon!!!
Alli Brosh has delivered some incredibly truthful and hilarious vignettes about life in Hyperbole and a Half. They resonate very closely with the millennial generation by highlighting on depression, identity crisis, and the ridiculousness of owning a pet. I absolutely adored this book and will continue to refer friends and family to read her very spot on and vulnerable descriptions of depression for those who do not understand what it feels like.
Freedom comes from realizing that human nature sucks and our job is to work to rise above it.
This was absolutely hysterical! Allie is my spirit animal.
Liked it a lot. It was a very easy read, funny but also gave me a new perspective of someone who suffers from depression. I loved the pictures, even my 10 year old dtr found the pictures funny without even reading the text. I had never read her blogs or knew anything about the writer. Just wished it was a little longer. Went through it pretty quick but feel like this may be a book I would go back to periodically for a laugh.
Just brilliant and very, very funny. Allie Brosh has a rare self awareness and insight into the workings of her own mind. Why her people look the way they do mystifies me..I actually looked her up online to see what that ubiquitous cone shape on her head might possibly be. Still no idea. Anyway, the writing and cartoons are first rate.
The honesty is hilarious, touching, and brutal all at the same time. I laughed  out loud at times, and then marveled at how well and insightfully the author was able to express her doubts, fears, and all the weird bits (that we all have) in her life. Loved this book!
Rate all the things!
You'll come full circle on this book. You'll laugh until you cry, then cry until you laugh. Poignant, funny, perfect.
Great for those who are still trying figure things out and love hilarious story-telling.  Best book I have read (for fun) in a while.
This is a must-buy! Allie is looking at herself, her dogs and everyday life stories in a totally different light. It is hilarious, weird and you think you know what kind of weirdo this Allie is at the end. But you have a bunch of laughs in between, since you have done that and been there. Maybe not in the far-out way of Allie. My wife thought some of the rather primitive drawings were scary. I felt like Allie draw how she thinks she looks from the inside.
Instead of this cliché hero of all heroes that I see in books, the person in this just feels like that, a person. Describing familiar problems that I didn't think anyone else besides me had. I could relate to a lot in this hilarious cross between a diary and a comic book, depression and the sudden bursts to do greatness only to spend the next three weeks 'taking a little break' from it all. It was almost like talking to a real person, except you were mute because you could never respond directly to them. Loved the book through to the end, spending most of the night reading until I passed out at 3:00 AM just to wake up at noon to finish it. Worth it.
Love the Hyperbole blog, and this book even more. People need to be aware that this book isn't all sunshine and roses--Brosh gives a realistic, and yes at times amusing, view of her struggles with depression and even suicidal thoughts. I admire her for sharing her struggles with the world and showing that with help, people can address their depression and get the help that they need.
Are you tired of reading text books full of mumbo jumbo or self help books that give you sunny everything will be ok if you have a positive attitude? This book combines what it really is like to be dysfunctional while being laugh out loud funny. If you feel alienated and don't understand the rules that the normals take for granted, this book will help you feel that you are not alone. After psychiatrist and therapist, with no real connections or any insights into who I truly am, I found someone who is a kindred spirit.
My daughter recommended this book, possibly because she knew I would recognize how eerily similar Allie Brosh's personality is to my own. I did. Alexis - point taken :)<br/>Hyperbole and a Half is a wickedly entertaining (and oddly introspective, for me at least) read.
Hilarious from start to finish.
Not as funny as what I usually read (David Sedaris for example.) Amusing but the level and focus on being a bad person got boring and narcissistic).
Hysterical!  My daughters and I can't get enough of the blog.  When is the second compilation going to come out?
Illustrations are minimalist and surprisingly effective.  The little creature representing herself is memorable and evocative. Observations of her inner world very similar to mine.  Allie, you are not alone!!  I bet it'd be a great supplement to a psych class during a focus on the id and the ego.  The last third of the book would be a good precautionary read immediately before a fourth step in a 12-step program.
I bought this book to have a laugh during a tough time in my life. The cover sold me. I find cartoons that are not particularly artistic or realistic but are still able to convey the concept fascinating. Ms. Brosh's odd little self portrait character became more endearing and understandable with each unfortunate situation told. Mission accomplished. Laughs achieved.
Quirky hilarious fun.  Awesome read for fans of dogs,humor, and mental health. Allie Brosh gives us all hope. Buy her book.
I bought this because my daughter enjoys reading the Hyperbole and a Half webcomic. This book has some items from that webcomic, plus additional new material that she hadn't seen. Funny and thought-provoking. I particularly like how she draws herself looking so "cartoony," but draws her dogs so realistically (the cover illustration shows that well). The looks on her dogs' faces just slay me! Also a good purchase for someone who is trying to understand their own or a loved one's depression, as the author has a couple chapters about her depression.
So now I'm finished and hoping there's some way I can throw more money at Brosh so I can have more. Please?
I really had a blast reading this book. It's hilarious, fun and yet simple. I love the authors pure honesty
Anyone who love dogs will love this book. Highly recommend! Very funny and does touch you  with some good concepts about depression.
Had me laughing in the middle of my doctors office. Stayed up reading it. I saw parts of myself in the book. Do recommend.
Allie is a genius!
I fell upon the blog by complete accident and knew the book had some repeat stories in it. I purchased the book b/c I already finished the blog. Simple as that.<br/><br/>There are parts of this book I've already re-read when I need a pick me up after a tough day or even just need to laugh to distract me from actually being productive. I love her wit and style and look forward to many more of her hilarious stories.
I like this book ALOT ! I would throw lots of money at this woman any time she writes ANYTHING. My simple dog worships her simple dog.
I laugh so much, in tears laughing! I love this book! Buy it you won't regret it! Laughter is the best medicine!
Good book, i found it very amusing. Easy, fun read. I laughed out loud several times. If you're looking for an easy, fun read - it's highly recomended.
I laugh every time I read this even though I read it all the time! Anyone who loves to laugh should read this book
I have owned this book for 6 months but have read it over and over a million times. :) it helps with the homesickness.
Though this is not a lengthy book, I finished it in one quick sitting. I found myself resonating with every page and thought to myself "it is good to know other people are just as insane as I am.." For anyone who has dealt with depression and anxiety, this book will make you feel "normal." A wonderfully entertaining and enlightening read!
I was laughing out loud. The illustrations are brilliant and moronic. I haven't reached more word minimum yet. Finally now.
Funniest book eva! I recommend for young adults and adults because of cursing about every known curse word. Funny and awesome. Thank you Allie Brosh!
Real.  Adds some grips to a lot of slippery ideas about life and growth.  I've given  a copy to a couple of family members because I relate to it so much.
For admonishing her past self for liking dogs so much, future Allie brosh sure writes about dogs a lot. Fun read.
I expected preachy, self-help-ish, babbling about how horrible the world is, and how we must "embrace love and light"...but instead, I found myself laughing aloud, and smiling broadly in recognition of myself relating to the author's angst, and frailties. Maybe the best acceptance comes with "s***ty parts". Without them, we would be a lot less interesting...and a lot less entertaining! Thank you Allie!
I read this book over and over, and it never gets old. It makes me feel better when things seem hopeless, and it makes me laugh even when I don't want to (i.e. at work and supposed to be doing work.)<br/><br/>In short...<br/>The content is amazing.<br/>The book is flawless visually.<br/>Allie Brosh is an inspiration.
I had a big ol' smile on my face the whole time I read this book. I absolutely love the thing.
Loved it.  I was reading this great book when I noticed my husband giggling across from me on the plane·he was reading along.  We continued to read like that the rest of the trip..laughing all the way.  Fun read!
Especially, "Boyfriend Doesn't Have Ebola... Probably" aka The Revised Pain Scale! She's one of the best new comedy writers on the scene!
there needs to be a second.was enjoyable until the end.so many similarities and situations I could relate too..clever and funny.
I first discovered Allie Brosh when someone sent me a link to her Improved Pain Chart (which I feel needs to be in every doctor’s office and emergency room) and spent the rest of that evening going through all the back entries of her blog. She has a lot of the same issues I do, and having them taken on with such humor (in both writing and drawings) had me both nodding in agreement and howling at the same time.<br/><br/>This book -same name as her blog- is a compendium of mostly new, but some old, work. It includes her two part essay on depression, which hit her right after she signed the book deal. Depression isn’t funny, but the essays are- and they are really quite good at explaining what depression is like. It’s not all about mental quirks, of course. There are episodes about her dogs (who have to be the stupidest and strangest dogs in the universe), and her run in with a cake, a robot parrot that says ‘Poop’ repeatedly, and lots of other things. If you need a laugh, go and read this book.
This book is a nice easy read, and is absolutely hilarious, especially if you have dogs. The stories are well told and the pictures are amazing!
This book is filled with a wonderful sense or humor, creativity, and self-awareness. I never finished a chapter without laughing, having a contemplative moment, or both. If you can't relate to one of the stories, you'll be able to empathize for sure. This is one of those books that feels like looking directly into the brain of another human and it's fascinating and wonderful.
This was the most entertaining book I have read in a long time. The goose story was my favorite one. Many laugh out loud moments. Having a bad day or week? READ THIS!
I ended up reading this basically in one sitting because it was so good. She's really clever and honest and it's a very enjoyable read.
It's hilarious! Buy it!<br/><br/>((Ok Amazon if I choose to write a review there shouldn't be a word quota. Don't tell me how many words to have in my review. That is dumb.))
This book is hilarious yet somewhat thought provoking. The drawings are really neat and funny. :) I would definitely recommend this book.
The images and anecdotes the author used were candid and creative.  Some vignettes were funnier, some more insightful...all entertaining.  I learned that I should never own a dog, I am not the only person who thinks 10 year old me was lame and embarrassing, and sometimes you gotta give clinical depression the finger and fight that disease in your own way, in your own terms.  I enjoyed every page of this book.
This book made me laugh so hard that I was choking on air. Definitely worth the read! You will be crying from laughing the whole time!
Allie Brosh is hyperbolically self-honest, honing in on the he awkwardness of self-reflection and two slightly stupid dogs.  The awareness of the futility and depression becomes hilarious because, despite the hyperbole, Brosh has a knack for making you laugh at yourself because in so many ways you also feel like an awkward, fake whose 1980s childhood has left you not so much scarred as poorly spray-painted.  The famous depression comics as well as the final comic on identity are brutally honest about the way depression feels in a way that one rarely sees in literature, much less net comics.  A strong recommend.
I am a female in my early twenties, and traces of self-discovery are still prevalent in my life. I never expected to be this impressed with my subconscious, but I am, now that Allie has laid it all out for the world to see. Brosh conjures up your inner self evaluator with witty commentary and calculated comics, leaving you feeling freshly aware of yourself, and maybe not as weird as you thought you were. - WLO
Wonderful whimsical drawings...mostly murmurings to self as you would find on a blog- which is how this originated..but it provokes grins and smiles of recognition of the same behaviour in ourselves.  Not terribly profound, but interesting POV.
Made me laugh out loud! I could relate on so many levels.I have pets and have seen and been through all of the scenario's! LOL :)
The book, much like her blog, was amazing.  I cannot recommend either enough.  She is not only funny, but incredibly insightful.
Good connection to teens. As a teacher, I'm always trying new ways to get kids interested and I'm hoping this will work for some!!
You can tell right away that she is true to herself, and her honesty and humor grab your attention. I like her way of viewing herself, and viewing the world.
Loved the pictures, it tells me more than what words can describe. A must read for any one depressed, cynical or melancholy.
Funny and I mean funny. No joke this is so funny. Pretty sure others will enjoy it as much as me.
I found this book hilarious! I can't tell you how many times I laughed out loud! There's so many relatable things, written in a fun, refreshing way!
book is insightful and drawings perfectly express the parts of the stories that arent written in text. will be buying all her future books too
This is one of the funniest books I have ever read (and reread many times.)  I find myself rereading sentences 2 or 3 times, just to try to figure out how she worded it so perfectly.  And the artwork is a perfect match.  There is some adult language, and some adult themes.  The sections discussing her depression were beautifully written and I have recommended it to others to read based on that alone.  But my favorite thing about Hyperbole and a Half is that it had me laughing so hard my sides hurt.
Laughed out loud till my body shook. Very entertaining and I could empathize with her. Her book is a mirror for many of us. Five stars!
This ridiculous unusual little story is offbeat and funny. A woman recalls her childhood obsessions and goes on and on about them as an adult and as a little girl. The little girl writes odd notes to her adult self asking questions and she expects answers in real time.<br/><br/>This story is not really for children, but in a pinch, it could entertain children and possibly give them nightmares or obsessions too. Nice original illustrations earn applause.
I only wish that she had another book for me to read. I can't wait to read more of her work. I won't stop talking about her and the magic she's created on paper.
Funny and relatable story that is a fairly quick read. The drawings help bring it to life - would recommend!
It's exactly what you wanted it to be. It's Allie. Being Allie. If you're tempted by it, then it's exactly what you hope it is.
The author puts into pictures and words what all but the very over-protected ninnies have felt on so many occasions.  She also manages to write about things I have never thought about, but when I read them I immediately recognize them as spot-on (moving across several states with dogs).  It is like I knew this stuff but needed the author to make me really aware of it.  I am ready for book #2,3,4...etc.  This is my replacement for the void left by Bill Watterson's Calvin and Hobbes books.
Genuine, silent seal laughter at this book. The stories are witty and strangely relatable and the simple yet perfectly descriptive drawings work so well.
This delightful little book puts a smile on the reader's face, but don't be fooled, it actually gives sensitive insight into the nature of depression. I must admit the title and the unique format first attracted me. Yes, it is quite entertaining and can stand on its own, but it could also be used as an indirect way to broach the subject of "being down" with an adolescent or friend.
Very funny and also many things a lot of people can relate to.  I've always enjoyed her blog, and the book was great!
What an amazing book I stumbled upon. I recommend it a million times over - I laughed until my sides hurt. It's witty and relatable. Read it.
Just like her blog, so much of this book spoke to me and allowed me to laugh at that which is hard to laugh at when it's yourself you are looking at.
This book had me laughing so hard! I'm glad there is someone out there who responds to certain situations in such a sarcastic and melodramatic way that I do. I am NOT alone!
I really enjoyed this book because its a quick-read which has quite a number of wisecracks and is actually funny. I also found that I could relate to the unfortunate situations the author has been or is still going through, because it was entertaining to read how she mocks herself for them and she correctly phrases the way I usually think of stuff and things.
Allie Brosh has a unique view of the world and a unique way of telling her stories. Hilarious, hysterical, and sometimes horrifying. The chapters on depression are the truth, and I have shared them with friends to explain the experience of depression. About halfway through reading it on my kindle, I ordered a hard copy so I can share this wonderful book!
Downloaded the sample.  Laughed at the author's  self-deprecating humor and just HAD to read more.<br/><br/>This is one of those fun reads that you can pick up at any time and just read another chapter.  You don't necessarily need to read it all in one fell swoop.  The pictures are important, so make sure your reading device is picture capable.<br/><br/>Very funny.  Very personal.  Psychologically savvy.  Humble.<br/><br/>Loved it!
Best book I've read all year. No question. A beautiful and hilarious examination of the human condition as told through relatable stories.
Pretty funny read. I really enjoyed the stories and the insight she gave of herself. If there is another book I will definitely be looking forward to reading it.
Cracking up the whole time. Awesome read and fast too. I finished in one day. Drawings are funny as well.
I loved this book! The depression story hit close to home a I loved the dog stories! I would recommend it to anyone.
this book is fantastic.  very well written.  amazing artwork. she says exactly what most of us are thinking on a daily basis. read it alone though because people will think you're crazy because you will be laughing.  loudly.
Allie's descriptions are hilarious, and the drawings really add to it.  They are simplistic but do a great job with expressions, which lends so much to the stories.<br/><br/>Also, the descriptions of her depression and what it feels like are honest and touching and a real lesson for anyone who is trying to help someone with depression.  As a society, we don't often help our friends with depression as much as we think, and Allie calls that out in a very honest and visceral way.
My sister bought me this book as a present. She deserves a star in heaven for that. I cannot sing the praises of this work highly enough. Allie Brosh's crazy drawings are topped only by her even crazier stories.  I particularly like Allie's very frank chapters on her struggle with depression. I had this condition myself for a good while after my husband's death and nearly burst into tears when I recognized some of the things I did - or failed to do - during this dark time. Only under Allie's pen can depression look like something even vaguely resembling humor and yet also be completely serious and honest. I'm still reeling from the awesome that is this book. If anyone is reading this, stop. Get the book. Read it instead.
Allie Brosh shows how the mundane can be hilarious and how the seemingly strange can be normal. She is, and always will be one of my favourite comedic authors.
It was great in a dark and twisty fashion. Like the Museum of Tolerance with the two doors labeled prejudice and nonprejudice we know that only the one door opens except the labels for this book would be selfish and selfless.  It's ok Allie only the selfish door opens. You took some really hard topics and made them hilarious. Kudos to you.
Seriously.<br/>People will look at you funny, you will miss your stop, there is a strong possibility of bladder failure.
I seriously laughed out loud dozens of times while I was reading this book and in many instances I almost felt like Allie Brosh was in my head, talking of very real and often unapproachable subjects. I couldn't even find a quote I would consider a favorite.
Brosh brings her crazy drawings and life stories to a book format, with great results. she shares her struggles with depression- great help for anyone likewise struggling, but also serves up hilarious family stories and mis-deeds. The book is great for dipping into when you have a little spare time. You can read it in chunks. It is a quick and enjoyable read. Take note- not for children.
I tend to be a harsh critic but Ioved this book, found it very creative, loved the art work and found her self portrait very endearing.  A must read, but buy the book instead of trying to read it on the kindle.  I hope Allow is working on a follow-up.<br/>..
Written in a very peculiar way. It was almost like a grown up picture book.<br/><br/>I toroughoy enjoyed every moment of the book. Very happy!
I found the blog a couple years ago, went back and read every entry. I'm glad I bought the Kindle version of the book. Even though I had read a lot of the material, she deserves the support. Her art is simple and brilliant, and complements her writing perfectly. When I read her stuff, I feel like someone is letting me into her imperfect, ridiculous soul.
I could not stop reading this book it is beyond compare to any other book I have read.<br/>it was awesome
Allie Brosh is hilarious in a similar way to the way Maria Bamford is hilarious. It's funny because it's true. Pee yourself funny. Tragically true.
This was the first time I've heard of or read Allie Brosh and didn't know what to expect. I read the sample and was laughing out loud. Bought it and read it in a couple of days. Will probably read it again too.
It had it's really funny moments but  I thought those moments were few and far between! It did seem to be just an elongated blog!
I love this book. Hilariously captivating from start to finish. Even delves deep into human psyche and captures true depression in an eye opening lol fashion. Couldn't be happier with this purchase.
A friend warned me; I can't say that she didn't. She said that, if I sneaked a peek, I would get sucked in and put off important things and stay up late and not get my work done. And she was right.<br/><br/>"Hyperbole and a Half," needless to say, is very, very funny. The chapter on Allie Brosh's two dogs, the mentally challenged "Simple Dog" and the sociopathic "Helper Dog," made me shriek with laughter. But the memoir also touched me with its chapters on depression, having gone through that myself.<br/><br/>Read "Hyperbole and a Half" when you have time to read it in one sitting. Don't say I didn't warn you.
Made me laugh out loud and made me realize I'm not crappy a person after all!<br/>It was great,recommended! Love!
Funny! Relatable in many ways. This is book is a quick read that will leave you wanting more. Read it!
Warning: by reading this book, you are putting yourself at risk for moments of uncomfortable introspection and disconcerting self-realization. But you’re also giving yourself the gift of uncontrollable, pee-in-your-pants laughter. As Allie recounts her varied experiences, ranging from training (or trying to train, rather) two unconventional dogs to getting lost in the woods with her mother and sister, she aptly finds the humor in even the worst situations, primarily by poking fun at herself and illustrating her memories with horribly drawn (but oh-so-funny) cartoons. Somehow, her combination of biting sarcasm and hopelessness along with a bit of disdain for the rest of the world make for an entertaining read that’s hard to put down. I found it especially compelling since several of her own flaws and fears are my own. It’s a little spooky how often I felt like she was writing MY story!! Like her popular blog (hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com), the book leaves the reader hungering for more. (Speaking of which, Allie, where have you been in the past few months? I’ve been waiting ages for your next post!!! I need my HaaH fix soon.)<br/><br/>PS - A note on why I don’t rate this book five stars….I know that Allie is being her honest, upfront self and I appreciate that, but I still could have done without quite so many "four letter words."
This girl is so funny and her drawings of herself and her dogs just cracked me up so much. Very funny book! :)
A quick funny read for the summer . Was laughing at times on the train back and forth too work .
Nice and easy. Some kind of funny. Do like it. Try it. Make me feel weird and depressed a little bit
Truly a funny book written in a believable set of scenarios showing our flawed humanity.  Possibly so funny because it is easy to relate to what is happening.  Loved all the dog troubles and solutions also.  Read and expect to relax and enjoy!
and sometimes ir is a LOL laugh and sometimes a wry smile as Allie B nails truth. Brave and bracing. Withstands much re-reading - good value for money.
This book is a kick in the pants! An inner search takes place as you read this book. I am thankful to know I am not the only one who is a little askew and down right crazy.
Absolutely hysterical. If you're looking for a quick read but want a lasting impression, here's your book. The anecdotes alone are worth buying the book, but the artwork adds a new dimension.
So smart and funny and enjoyable in every way. Laughed out loud many times. I should have bought a hard copy so I could lend to everyone I know.
Best. Book. EVAHHHHH<br/>Funny, smart, and AWESOME-SAUCE :DDDDD<br/><3<br/>I love all of her comics and this book was so awesome :D<br/><br/>5/5 stars c:
I loved how deeply philosophical this book was while still maintaining lighter comedic times.  It was really easy to relate to all her thoughts on life and the human condition
Amazing as always. I've been a big fan of her blog for a couple of years, and the new material is just as funny and heartwarming as her classics.
I found reading the scan quite difficult at times because certain chapters featured white text on grey background (what I presume was coloured on the real book), or black on dark grey text.<br/><br/>However despite the occasional painful reading and zooming (some of the pictures have text that requires it), the stories itself and the pictures accompanying it are humorous, relatable and a good read.<br/><br/>Would have given 5 stars if not for the difficulty in reading the text.
I loved reading about someone else with depression who also has a depraved sense of humor.  It helped me feel less alone.
This book had me laughing from beginning to end. I love all of the illustrations. They are the perfect punctuation.
It was the funniest book I have read in ages. It made me laugh smile and overall made my day.
I had to keep keep reading because this was freakishly hilarious! I laughed out loud many times while reading this book. Love it. Must read.
Pure awesomeness.  At times I laughed so hard I was crying.  And the deeper parts also hit home quite well.
depression is no joke and people suck -<br/><br/>this book brings laughter to the sad places<br/><br/>this book brings simple light to lessen the darkness
Just a pleasure to read!!!  The pictures were great and I laughed out loud through most of the book!!!  Thoroughly enjoyed it.
This book has strangely compelling images and disturbingly astute observations of being a person who is trying to figure out the essence of being an adult. If you sometimes do things and say, "wait, I'm an adult -- why would I do (or think) that?," then this might be your next favorite book. Or you may want to read it for the hilarious analysis of dog behaviors.
I was the annoying girl laughing out loud at appointments and waiting in lines.  I have already bought two as gifts!
What a fun book.  Allie's drawings are great and have so much emotion and character!  I love that crazy mind, makes me feel a little more normal about myself.  (and I mean crazy in the kindest way!)
Hugely amusing. I really enjoyed reading this book, in the sort of way an eighth year old may enjoy watching the Rugrats.
It's what we all hoped it would be.  Funny, thought/feels provoking, and beautifully illustrated, it has all the appeal of her website of the same name.<br/><br/>If you haven't read it, you should.  It's fine to own on kindle, but I highly recommend actually getting a paperback copy.  It's a gorgeous book.
I had to put out down several times because I was laughing so hard.  Loved it and can't wait to read more of her stuff.
This book is awesome. I think that it is the funniest book I have  ever read. I usually read it when I was  bored but I laughed every time.
I read this book over and over because it makes me laugh when nothing else does. The illustrations capture more emotion than any artist could ever wish for. Brosh's storytelling is brilliant. Nothing but love for this author .
Be prepared to laugh and cringe at the same time! This was a very fun and light read. Read it!
If her self-loathing were any more adorable, it would qualify as sainthood. Or Narcissism. Anyway, it's Very Funny.<br/>Recommended for anyone who has struggled with the darker moods.
Allie is the first person I've ever read who has been so perfectly able to capture sad things in a way that make me laugh very hard. There were also funny parts, and dogs. This should be required reading and I am so not kidding. -- Rita Arens, author of contemporary young adult novel THE OBVIOUS GAME (Inkspell Publishing, 2013)<br/> and editor of SLEEP IS FOR THE WEAK (Chicago Review Press, 2008) <br/>.
Having over 1,100 books in my personal library, I rate this as the best of the best! In fact I must say I love this Alot! ;) Truly a unique book and the cleverest humor I've ever seen! Those familiar with Allie's blog will already know her world-class talent for making us all think deeply and laugh our a$$es off at the same time! Go, Allie! :)
et me sum it up in one glorified hyperbole: This book is possibly one of the funniest books ever written since the beginning of time. Never have I ever fallen so in love with a character as I've have for the exaggerated stick-figure illustration of the author. This book made me laugh out loud from the first chapter where she details how she found a letter from her 10-year-old dog obsessed self
Had me peeing my pants from laughing so hard! Loved it!!!! Takes some of the best blog posts and adds some new stories, the only thing it's missing is Kenny Loggins Christmas...
this was a big dose of fun and smart and I hated for it to end!  would recommend to anyone who likes to laugh as a stress reliever.
So cute and expressive, the drawings are. The writing is clear and concise and it is a fun and funny read.
Probably one of the funniest books I have read this year. Great illustration that compliments the writing. Looking forward to reading more from this author
Allie Brosh's Hyperbole and a Half literally takes my breath away and brings me to tears. I've had to dole it out in sips and tiny bites to make it last as I can as it is so so funny I want to keep it going for as long as I can.<br/><br/>I read the bit on the goose on a flight the other day, and the women sitting next to me asked me what I was reading, because if it was that funny she needed to get it for herself.<br/><br/>Maybe it's a common warped sense of humor, but her stories are so funny that I feel like I'm right there with her, feeling her pain, and laughing at her, at myself and with the world at the ridiculousness of it all.<br/><br/>Thank you thank you thank you!
I loved this book.  Many people can relate to the stories and fully understand what she is talking about.  Her issues with trying to get her dogs to do or not do something are priceless and true!  I really recommend this as a fun read!
I bought this for my Kindle app and have not regretted it. It is laugh out loud funny on the first read and continues to be enjoyable on each subsequent viewing. When I'm feeling down I can pull up Allie's book and it cheers me right up!<br/>I'm looking forward to her next book!!
This is a cleverly written and crudely drawn book that I so very much enjoyed. I'd recommend this to my snark-loving friends.
Please please pleassssse write another book about this your a great author and need to write more about your experiences
Allie Brosh is funny and engaging. Never read her blog but bought this book b/c of the awesome reviews. It didn't disappoint. There was much laughter and guffaws littered my couch while reading this book.
Allie! You are my hero! I hope she (the author) realizes what a tremendous impact she has had on the lives of all of us who have struggled with various psychological disorders--especially depression--showing the humanity and the humor in life, even life while depressed. Her combination of frank writing and deceptively simple MS Paint illustrations provide a window into the mind of someone who is just a little bit nuts--and we are ALL a little bit nuts in our own uniquely weirdo ways. I have shared chapters of this book with everyone I know, and everyone resonates to it--from my mom, who hates cartoons and anything whimsical, to my "I don't believe depression is real, you just need to get over it" friends, to friends currently in the dark hole that is major depression to remind them that they really are not alone, and what they are going through sucks, but is acceptable (them's some dead, dead fish). This book will make you laugh, and it will make you more human. And Allie, you have been a friend from afar to so many of us who needed it. Whatever else you do in life from now on, you have made an enormous impact on the world, you win.
I give this book a 5 star rating because it deserves it.  I love how creative Allie is with her stories.  I follow her blog and laugh at the stories I read.<br/><br/>There was nothing in the book I didn't like.  Everything was fun to read.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a great laugh.
This is exactly what I expected upon seeing the book. Some of the stories are taken from the website, but none the less still quite funny to read again. 10/10 would recommend.
I've always loved Allie's site, and this book delivered just as much hilarity. The chapter about her dogs made me scream with laughter. The book also includes classics like the God of Cake and The Party.
If I could put my life on paper, this would be it. It is so funny and in tune with I think everyone. The images are the best at letting me know how I feel. I feel that! Just so much fun. Laugh out loud to yourself in your room late at night reading....FUN!
As I'd hoped, Allie delivers a delightfully witty, clever book that is a perfect companion to her blog. My only regret is that I wish I'd have purchased the paper version rather than Kindle because this would be a fabulous guest room or coffee table book. I can read myself out of a bad mood with just a few of Allie's creatively told & illustrated stories. A must read-you won't be sorry!
Simply amazing. I laughed, I cried.... I laughed until I cried. Just an amazing book. I'd definitely recommend it to everyone.
Loved this book and have gotten into reading her blog because of it.  Her drawings are unusual but definitely bring the words to life.  Her stories are oftentimes hilarious.  Her candid description of depression was amazing.  I wish her great happiness and success in the future.
...Just because I could read her stories all day really. I sort of do already.<br/><br/>It's a lot of what's on her blog. Some really great new stories, as well. I really liked hearing the origin of Simple Dog and her vicious hatred of happiness in other dogs. I could really relate to this character flaw (strength?) as I am also a hater.<br/><br/>Allie Brosh is excruciatingly relatable. She manages to broach serious topics, like the acquisition of a new pet, or depression, whatever, without making you squirm when you hear about those uncomfortable feelings. I hate human interaction and feel super weird when people tell me about their insides or try to make me think about mine. She manages to make me like it. I'm pretty sure it's the poorly drawn pony tail and crazy eyes.<br/><br/>My only regrets for this book is that she didn't end it with the new Dinosaur Costume story on her blog. The image of a velociraptor being put in the corner makes me laugh till I hurt, every time.
I had never heard of this author before but was intrigued by her illustrations. This book had me laughing out loud. It is also a poignant description of depression.
Really funny! Perfect "light" reading to bring on vacation. People were looking at me wondering why I was laughing so much on the beach.
I love her offbeat sense of humor. The only thing I didn't like was that I finished reading it was over. I wanted to keep going.
it was a really good book made me think of my childhood memories. Its just the most cutest book ever
Wow, this was the best explanation of what it's like to be depressed to someone who has not been depressed -- and it was not depressing!  Also, I loved the chapter on getting mad at inanimate things because they inconvenience you, etc. -- that is so me.  A fun and light read...
Fantastic! So funny and relatable. I felt like she was describing all of the bad parts about my own life but in a funny way. I even understand myself much better because of this book.
Wonderful read! It's like I have my own personal piece of shriveled corn now. Thank you so much for writing it!
I literally kept laughing out loud this entire book. Really enjoyed it and recommend it if you need a laugh.
This book is hilarious, (let's just say, crazy goose) and at some points even emotional. I'll read it many more times!
This was a fairly quick read for me, probably because I enjoyed it so much! I purchased the kindle version, and although I'm not sure if I'm missing anything in the print version, I certainly didn't feel like I missed it.<br/><br/>I thought this book was hilarious, and I found myself showing many of the pictures to whoever happened to be sitting near me while I was reading. A lot of the topics were relate-able, and the author's comedic spin was very much appreciated.<br/><br/>I will definitely be re-reading this book, and I would highly recommend it :)
Allie Brosh gives a view of depression and every-day frustrations that we can all relate to. A pleasant read with plenty of chuckles.
Amazing comic...the author is brilliant and a warp/unique sense of humor that seems to echo my childhood. ...def worth the read!
Loved it! It was hilarious but I am pretty much a fan of anything allie brosh does because her awkward tales make me giggle and cry with how close they hit to home
The pictures were great!! They added a whole new level of life and laughter to this story. I've been a fan of memoirs for about 5 years now and this was the perfect combo of memoir and funny short story/life insight book. Very good for my much needed "me" time at the end of a long day when I sometimes need something that doesn't require a great deal of concentration and deep thought. Not to say this book wasn't at all insightful. It certainly reminded me to pay more attention to the funny silly things in life, not take myself too seriously, and to not worry so much about the little stuff.
Allie takes the ordinary frustrations we all face, especially those of us we have pet dogs, into fits of laughter. The only gripe I have is it is not too nice to read as an e-book. Get the paper version instead.
Wow! I LOVE this book! It was truly a rare laugh-out-loud experience! Allie Brosh has a gift for telling a great story and drawing simple but illustrative drawings with Paintbrush software that are hilarious themselves, without the text, but add the writing in, and it's absolutely fantastic! Great for anyone who is a human being and experiences hard times, this book might just help someone else to see the humor in their life struggles. Wish I had bought the paper copy and not the kindle version, but I will be buying the hard copy anyways, for myself and as a gift to others. Highly recommend it as a gift to someone you know who is going through depression or other similar hard times. Allie Brosh is AWESOME!!
The drawings kept me laughing and thinking about it days/weeks after I read it. Will probably order a hard copy as I read it first on the kindle.
Quick read but I absolutely lol'd throughout the entire thing!! She is hilarious and I can't wait for more books from her!
Some of the language is its only downfall or I would have given it five stars! It is hilarious and fun to read.
There are 18 stories in the book. I recognized about 7 of them as content originally posted on the blog, including Allie's two incredible posts about depression. The rest are new content, and they're everything you would expect. LOVE this.
I’d never read this blog, but it is a favorite of some of my coworkers so I thought I’d try this book out. The author has a unique sense of humor and the very poorly drawn comic scenes just add to that humor. Most of this I found very funny and laughed out loud many times throughout. Her stories from childhood I found of particular hilarity.<br/><br/>--  “I had tasted cake and there was no going back. My tiny body had morphed into a writhing mass of pure tenacity encased in a layer of desperation. I would eat all of the cake or I would evaporate from the sheer power of my desire to eat it.”<br/><br/>The largest chapter dealt with the authors bought with depression. It is really hard sometimes to add a bit of funniness to something that is so hard to feel anything through but she did it and I found it to be of particular interest. The way she explained her feeling of depression or lack of feeling totally hit the mark. It was less frivolous than other chapters but I think it was the one I liked the most.<br/><br/>--  “However, I could no longer rely on genuine emotion to generate facial expressions, and when you have to spend every social interaction consciously manipulating your face into shapes that are only approximately the right ones, alienating people is inevitable.”<br/><br/>There are a lot of stories about or containing dogs so if that is not your particular cup of tea then maybe you won’t like it as much as I did. But I <3<3<3 dogs so most of those I found entertaining as well. This is really good for if you want to just have a god chuckle. We all need that sometimes, also I get to feel slightly better about myself because I don’t have nearly the issues that the author seems to have as I’d never throw sand at children which seems to be a constant battle for her.
I'm a long-time fan of the blog, so I already knew half of the stories, and it didn't take long to get through the rest. The new stories (and old), other than the ones mostly about debilitating depression, were absolutely hilarious, but I don't think it took me a whole hour to get through it. I would have appreciated it a lot more if all of the material had been original, considering the old material is still available for free. If you just want to support the author out of a deep-seated loyalty, go ahead and buy it, but if you are looking for your next good read that will have you captivated for at least a few days, just read it at the store or request that your library stock it and check it out there.
Loved this book! It is funny, a little sad, and completely relatable. I especially love her illustrations. Read this book!
i abolutely love this book. it even made an especially difficult day seem surprisingly bright.<br/>i definitely reccomend for anyone who's in need of a smile.
Brosh is one of a kind. Her art is deceptively simple, with a layer of deep, brilliant stuff just beneath. Love.
this book was really funny! probably the best I have and will ever read! I'm so tired from laughing so much!
A terrific book by the award winning blogger of hyperboleandahalf.com . It takes you though the best moments of her life and the worst. I hope this book gets in as many hands as possible.
I love this author's wit and dry sense of humor.  I am fully engaged and entertained as I read her material.  I can elate to so much of it, especially since dogs are a big part of our family.  She can lift me right out of a blue mood!  I have never been disappointed with her writings.
Allie Brosh is an amazing writer and a talented artist. She manages to give a deep, unflinching look at depression while making you laugh your butt off. I don't know how you could ask for more than that. Do yourself a favor and buy this book!!!
Worth buying! Quick read, I laughed aloud enough my husband began to demand why I was laughing!  I loved the blog and the book had my favorite stories (I adore simple dog and helper dog!)
I love this book!  The author's stories about herself and her illustrations make me laugh every time.  Allie Brosh has such an odd-ball sense of humor and her drawings, while simple, add volumes to show the hilarious meaning of each section.  I highly recommend this if you want a good laugh and have an affinity for flawed coping mechanisms.
I was hesitant about reading this book, but I was NOT disappointed!  Brosh was fun, funny, and very insightful. A fun read I would definitely recommend.
I really do love Allies blog and I am so impressed with how she manages to trick herself into behaving like a real normal person. I think everyone has the weirdness inside them, but she actually talks about it and points it out to the rest of us.  Her artwork is a delightful blend of childlike line work and a twisted sense of humour that really appeals to me.  Her story about her depression makes me just want to hug her and whisper " shhhhh, it will all be alright.  We all love you and we will be here for you when you come back out."
Liked it so much I bought two extra copies to give away. Smart, fun, funny, and very clever. Very entertaining!
It was so funny i was struggling  for breath while i was reading it. Mere words cannot express the amount of humor this book has put in to my life.<br/>AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING .<br/>READ ALL THE CHAPTERS!!!!<br/>PAY ALL THE FINES?!?!
Allie Brosh is hysterical.  I can't stop laughing out loud every time I read one of her stories.  The illustrations only add to the fun.
This is very funny stuff. Especially when the author explores the psyche of her younger self or the decision making power of her dogs. Some parts were so wonderful that I felt compelled to read them aloud to family and friends. I did restrain myself from reading aloud to fellow commuters, but found that laughing audibly while reading on the train got me a seat to myself.
So hilarious. I can just state at the pictures and laugh and laugh.  I love how she thinks and how she describes the sheer madness of those goofy dogs. What a genius !!!
...is one of the funniest and most thoughtful books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Thank you Allie Brosh...and sssshhhhhhhh.......  - Vincent Yanez, author of Einstein's Shutter
Allie Brosh has a unique way of seeing things and puts them on paper I'm exactly that way. I thoroughly enjoyed following her reasonings and descriptions...<br/>Laughed out loud innumerable times! Excellent!
Funny account of things we can all relate to. The chapter about simple dog had me in stitches, laughed out loud.
I have been a fan of Hyperbole and a Half for a long time, and I must say that this book is a perfect overview/summary of the blog, even though it barely scratches the surface of it. Allie, you did well, you magnificent lady.
I literally layed around reading this and laughing my butt off until tears were streaming down my face. I loved it. The illustrations are brilliant! I want more. Yes.
This book made me laugh out loud repeatedly and surpassed all of my expectations.<br/>I recommend it highly!<br/>Thanks Allie!
buy this quick and easy read.  insightful, very humorous and entertaining.  you'll relate!  it's a must for those who suffer from depression or are dog lovers.
Allie is certainly a very talented writer and artist. Actually, the drawings were my favorite part of the book. Allie's ability to precisely convey such complex emotions/expressions with just a few simple lines amazes me. The only reason I didn't give the book 5 stars is because it is essentially still a blog, which hasn't reached the status of a book for me. I am glad I discovered Allie and will surely look out for her new works as well as follow her blog.
I found this book funny. My favorite part is the dog chapter. So true. I thought the drawings were fun too.
Fun read about a puzzling journey. Endearing author.  I may never have a full understanding of depression, but I learned so much and appreciate the delivery of this message. The book and drawings are somewhat dark, dry humor and I relate to this more than most, so I laughed out loud. I felt completely in the moment while reading. Thoroughly enjoyed this book!
Once you figure out what's going on, which took me awhile, I began to realize that this is probably the most creative "book" I've had the pleasure of encountering!  Wow, this is serious originality.  I highly recommend.
This is one of my favorite blogs, and I was super excited that she made a book. I bought the kindle version, almost wish I had bought a hardcopy so I could share it with more people.
This book as absolutely fabulous! It has a bunch of memories written out with cute drawings to accompany them. And she talks about depression in a way that makes it easier to understand as an outsider.
I've been reading Allie's blog for a while and her posts are always spot on, so of course this book is just like that, with the only difference (and improvement) that her narration is more linear. We get to know who she is as a person, we get to learn from her experiences and we get to relate to her even more than before. This book has humor, sarcasm, sadness, but most important of all, it's an honest book. And everyone needs an honest book once in a while. And what better way to experience one than with awesome illustrations.
I'm so happy this book was published, and hope the positive review will inspire her to either write another, or add more updates to her blog. She's been the only person who has truly defined depression in a way that makes those who don't suffer through it, understand it. While there were more blog repeats than I originally figured there would be, it's still well worth purchasing.
Haven't laughed this hard since I discovered Dave Barry 30 years ago.  Not every essay is funny, in fact a couple are plenty sad, but all are good.  The more analytical stuff reminds me vaguely of David Wong at Cracked.com, another excellent and unconventional writer.  Good stuff.
Brosh is a comedic genius, her blog never fails to send me into fits of giggles and her book is no different.  Her stories about her dogs and her childhood make me laugh until there are quite literally tears in my eyes.<br/><br/>The only possible complaint I can give is that I wish there were more book, as I managed to finish this within a day of buying it (admittedly I also spent the entire day reading it, it's that hard to put down).  I hope she does another soon.
Well I love dogs. For years I've watched my dogs do the same things mentioned in the book. Her candid chapter about depression seemed more honest than anything I was ever told by any professional. The last few sections about self realization was brilliant. Good read.
Hysterically written! Allie Brosh has taken some hard, unfortunate feelings and events and made it funny and fun to read. Thank you Allie for this book!
Most of the content for this book was already on her blog, but it was funny to revisit!  I enjoyed it :)
With the exception of the two chapters dealing with her depression, I found it fun to read. Also love the drawings.
there were points where I laughed so hard I didn't think I could ever stop. I had been skyping someone while reading the cake section, and they asked me if I was okay several times. read, but maybe get an oxygen tank first
Easily one of the funniest books I've ever read, and intensely thought provoking to boot. If you like laughter, dogs, cake, or delving into the human condition, you will love this book.
This book was just ok, I purchased it based on the reviews which were very positive. It was funny in parts, but never really laugh out loud which is what I was looking for.
This book is hilarious. Check out her blog, and if you like it - the book is fun to have.<br/><br/>Kindle edition is not ideal with the images. Wish they were formatted a little better.
This book was an amazing read. Laughed the whole way through! Wonderfully written and the illustrations add even more comedy to an already side-splitting story! I thoroughly enjoyed it.
I was excited for this book, and I was not disappointed. If you're thinking of buying it, do it. stop over thinking everything.
The small illustrations were great and kept it interesting. It definitely got wordy and monotonous at times. Witty and light.
This book is so funny that I read it in one afternoon. The thing is the majority of the content is available on Allie's blog. I am happy to support her as an artist but I do wish there had been more original content. Otherwise great book!
I've bought over 100 Kindle books so far, and this is easily my favorite one. I've already read it twice, and I'm sure I'll re-read it many times more. Allie's ability to make me laugh out loud while hurting inside is amazing, and her crazy-funny illustrations are priceless. (So glad her publisher priced this book nonetheless.) I'd give her 10 stars if I could.
This book was unbelievably funny. Seriously, it was great, all the story are hilarious but accompanied with Allie's visual memes their even better. From start to finish you will literally be laughing out loud. I am so glad I purchased this book, it's one I can read over and over and over again and never grow tried of!
Lots of great insight into depression, hidden in some really hilarious stuff. I kinda want to hang out with Allie, now.
Hyperbole and a Half is humor and artistry at its finest. The renaissance has nothing on Miss Bosh or her cartoons!
Funniest book I have read in years. It is also insightful.  It is a great read for young and old alike.
This book is funny for dog owners or dog owners in difficulty!  Whitty and light hearted.  An anytime everywhere book.
Absolutely hilarious.  Enjoyed it from start to finish.  Makes me feel so much better about the antics that happen and have happened in my own life.
An entertaining and quick read. Some of the stories are from the blog, but there are many new ones as well.
i liked how insightful the writer was about how she processes her feelings. Her drawings were funny..loved them.<br/>here experiences were not too out of the ordinary but she wrote about them very creatively and brought situations to life well.<br/>overall funny...but wasn't blown away.
Fantastic book!! I was a bit sad to see the new pain scale and how it came to be weren't included!!<br/><br/>Well done Allie! Can't wait for the next one!!!
Really like Allie Brosh. There are a number of comics that aren't in the website. I think I may have to buy the hard-copy (rather than just the e-book) though.
awesome this book has to be one of the most hilarious book as I have ever read..simply amazing book :)
Allie Brosh is awesome and hilarious! This book was fantastic! Buy it now! Give it to your family and friends!
Cute, basically everything that's on her blog already though. Read it there for free rather than pay $10 For this.
The book lives up to my expectations, having been a blog fan for some time. Funny, insightful and often flat-out hilarious.<br/>http://www.amazon.com/Dog-Ma-The-Zen-Of-Slobber-ebook/dp/B008SIQ1BS/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1390069577&sr;=8-2&keywords;=dog-ma+the+zen+of+slobber
I honestly don't know if you'll have a similar experience of thinking 'Oh my God, this is exactly what I'm going through', but this is definitely a great insight into what it's like to have depression and have low self-worth that Allie Brosh somehow manages to make hilarious.
I cried from.laughing throughout, probably because so much of it is oddly true. Author spares nothing in being brutally honest about herself.
This book was great. It made me laugh throughout and I started thinking about what's shitty about me, too. Life has sucked for me lately, and this book helped me cheer up and consider how to make things better. Thank you!
Amazing! Funny, poignant and sooo in touch! I loves every page and have already re-read portions of the book many times!
I wanted to like it, I wanted to laugh and I wanted to have a book to recommend to friends as a "you've got to read this book...it's a real hoot."  Sadly, it just didn't click for me.  It brought an occasional smirk but nothing that seemed overtly funny.  I really liked the "My Dad Said" book and stuff by Jeff Foxworthy but this book is different from those and I just simply didn't enjoy it.
Where do I start??? Just thoroughly enjoyed this book and the 'dark' humor! Plan to buy a few copies to pass along!
I can't believe how many of the situations I SO relate to. My dogs remind me of  "simple" dog and "helper" dog; I have a new reverence for childhood tantrums, and even get the phase of hermitism.<br/>Thanks so much!
When I started reading this book, I had no idea what I was getting into.  I just noticed that this book was getting rave reviews and I had to check it out for myself.<br/><br/>I opened this book around midnight one night when I was having trouble sleeping, thinking that after a couple pages my eyes would get heavy and I could fall asleep.  I was so wrong.  I couldn't put it down once I cracked it open.  Needless to say, I didn't get any sleep that night.<br/><br/>Never in my dreams would I think that I could find someone who could not only match my sense of humor but could also express it in crappy drawings.  I laughed so hard and out loud from the very beginning.  The pictures were hysterical and I just couldn't get enough.<br/><br/>The author writes about her own life experiences with her dogs, her procrastination and even her bout with depression, but in a way makes you see it all from a different perspective.  I thought that by adding the pictures that it kind of brought that short stories to life, especially when she was trying to test her dog's intelligence, or lack thereof.<br/><br/>I would recommend this book to just about anyone.  This book will have you in stitches and if not, then there is no hope for you because I don't know how anyone could read this book without at least one good hearty laugh here and there.
I have not read this book yet, but love the ease of the Kindle and receiving books this way.  Thanks
This book made me feel not so alone for being weird, hating people, hating myself, and all the while finding it all entertaining. And the illustrations are hysterical. And the parts about dogs.... and the analogy about depression compared to dead fish, and the letters to her younger self.... I just died. Read it. It only took me 4 hours.
Very few books have made me laugh this hard. And cry silently. This is not a light read but a great one.
Hilariously funny and creepily accurate about dark inner workings... at least about some of mine. I laughed so hard I was shaking in parts.
I freAking loved this book. she is hilarious. I can't wait to read everything she has ever written or will write in the future. I always share her blog to friends and I always be sharing my opinion of this book also. LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BOOK!!
this book was such an enjoyment to read. I could relate to do many things that were said and I loved the sense of humor. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a light hearted read.
This book caused me to have laugh out loud giggle fits nearly every time I read it. The graphics are crude but fit the text perfectly.
I laughed, I cried (because I was laughing so hard). I identified with way too many of the scenarios!<br/>I had not been aware of the blog before but certainly will have to check it out. After hearing the interview with Ms. Brosh on Fresh Air I was hooked.<br/>Some day I only hope I too can "CLEAN ALL THE THINGS". Simply brilliant
A sort of remembered memoir and philosophy of life, people and dogs, that is sad and funny and worth it. Love the art work. How can you resist the cover art?
I laughed out loud, a lot, when reading this. The Goose Incident, the Cake Incident, The Helper Dog...all just stupid funny. The parts on the author's depression gave me great insight.
Bought this for my daughter and she LOVED it. She would laugh out loud while reading. Then, of course, she had to read aloud to the rest of us what made her laugh. Turned out to be a great book for all of us.
really funny and entertaining. The truth hits close to home and putting these feelings onto paper is quite a feat. Every paranoid shcitzophrenic will love this book!
Just as wonderful and funny as her blog. I would estimate about half the stories are new and half pulled from her blog.
I have never seen better intentionally terrible art. Her drawings elicit more emotion than "good" art, and her stories are earnest and hilarious. Most of these stories can be found, for free, on her blog, but you should bathe her in riches anyway.
It is a very funny book that helped me. Her stories are great, her comics were silly, and I felt that, overall, it is a very poignant collection of stories.
The best of all of her comics on her blog!! Read this book with my boyfriend and we both love it
So freaking hilarious! I cried laughing so hard! Easy to relate to some of the author's crazy situations! Wonderfully refreshing.
The author explores an inner landscape in a unique way .  Combines reveting harsh self analysis with humor. I found myself saying omg someone else has had that same disturbing thought !  Especially enjoyed the dog vignettes.
I really had a good time reading the book. I totaly enjoyed every page. The whole week i was walking with a smile on my face. It's a pity the book is so short. I would really enjoy more stuff from the author. I know that the book was originaly a blog, so you can check it out if you want. There is also a video of the author reading the book in front of the audience on youtube. If you want to make yourself feel better -  the book is a great medicine.
Thus is an amazing book. Her chapters on depression are spot on and I admit brought some tears to my eyes. By far this book is one of the best blends of serious topics with humor
This won't be a helpful review… but I honestly adore Allie Broch and her blog. If you have a sense of humor at all, buy this book. If you do not have a sense of humor, buy it for someone who does and score some cool kid points.
I've read some posts on Allie's blog and find her entertaining in a very real way. I read this book in just a couple days and enjoyed it. The only thing that stopped it from being 5 stars is that much of this is already on her blog. As a new reader this had limited impact but if you are a long-time fan you may feel cheated.
The ONLY criticism that I have is that "How Kenny Loggins Ruined Christmas" was not included, as that is one of the best.<br/><br/>Allie Brosh has an offbeat and dry humor, which generally has me laughing until I cry. She also is able to shine a flashlight on the realities of life and sadness (and sometimes even depression) with humor and honesty.<br/><br/>No, this book isn't entirely new material. There are a few recycled posts from her blog. Is it worth the money anyway? YES. And another YES. For the story about the goose ALONE it is worth the money.<br/><br/>(Also, if you didn't like Jenny Lawson's review of this book, and you read either the Bloggess or Hyperbole and a Half blogs without laughing so hard you want to pee your pants, then this isn't the book for you. If you almost pee yourself reading Brosh's God of Cake or Lawson's Beyonce the Giant Metal Chicken, you should already have bought this book already. And then go buy Let's Pretend This Never Happened.)
The drawings combined with the text are perfect.  I read it twice and laughed more the second time. Can't wait to read it again. Since I couldn't describe the story, I had to gift the book to my daughter and then we discussed.
Brosh does an excellent job of combining a modern sense of humor with spot-on illustrations. I couldn't stop from laughing in public, nor resist sharing it with my friends. A great way to make time fly!
Related so well to so many parts. Laughed until I cried and then laughed more. Read the cartoons out loud to myself and forced others to listen to me read. Absolute delight.
interesting relatable stories of complex feelings creatively "simplified"  and resolved. Funny sad happy and everything in between. loved it. :)
Allie Brosh is hilarious and fearless, whimsical and honest. I don't know how you could get through this book without laughing dozens of times--half in self-recognition, half at her own awareness of her crazy life. Especially recommended for dog people. You'll see.
This book really hit the spot for me. I haven't laughed so hard while reading in many months. I think I enjoyed the book so much because I can picture myself using some of the same wonky coping strategies that Allie Brosh uses.<br/><br/>The book is a selection of short stories about animal antics and personal reminiscences illustrated with Allie Brosh's odd scrawled drawings. There is one longish story about depression that made me realize how little I know about that illness, but even that story is upbeat enough not to spoil the mood.<br/><br/>Funny animal stories may be familiar territory, especially if you surf the Web, but Ms.Brosh does them as well as anyone does. Sit back and enjoy!
I love her book. It is exactly what you would want and expect from her awesome hilarious and deep comics.
loved this book, I often found family reading over my shoulder trying to figure out what was so funny. I highly recommend this book if you need a good laugh!
I don't know where to start on why I liked this book so much, so it was probably a mistake to decide to try to review it.  It's disconcerting to know there is someone else out there that has had similar experiences and feellings, but also comforting in a way.  The author's willingness to open some of the darkest times of her life and how she attempted to cope with them is actually reassuring.  The book is a reminder that you don't have to win every battle to win the war against yourself.  Oh, and she totally gets dogs and loves them anyway :) .
A touching & poignant depiction of the complexities of what appears to be a relatively simple, comfortable life. Veers only occasionally into cutesiness but when it stays on the right side of that line, it's adorable. Very smartly written. Hilarious too. Really enjoyed it.
My sides hurt from laughing so much and her drawings are hysterical.  Even the two chapters about her own depression had me chuckling.  I made everyone in my house read the one about the goose hahahah.
I loved this book, actually a collection of her essays - very very funny. The only problem I had was buying this in the wrong format. I was in a hurry, so I bought it for my Kindle. But the pictures don't enlarge. At least they didn't for me. And the pictures are what is really really funny. OK, so the dog throwing up in the back seat is funny, but the picture of the dog being so proud of herself for doing it is really really funny, and all the better if you can see the detail. So I'm giving the book a 5 star rating, because it was my fault I couldn't enjoy the pictures as much as I would have liked to. You can see why I like this author.
hy*per*bo*le<br/>n.<br/>A figure of speech in which exaggeration is used for emphasis or effect, as in "I could sleep for a year" or "This book weighs a ton".<br/><br/>Just saying the word hyperbole is funny.  Hyperbole!  Hyperbole!  Hyperbole!  Having the word "hyperbole" in the title made me curious.  Wait~~it made me the most curious person in the world!  Okay, maybe not~~maybe there are curiouser (that's not a word) people in the world.  But this is all about hyperbole, right?<br/><br/>Allie Brosh is an award winning blogger at [...]  She.  Is.  Hilarious.  Prior to reading this book I had never visited the blog so I was uncertain what to expect.  What I got was a book filled with some really funny stories that told by anyone else in any other way probably wouldn't be funny at all!  The stories range from a four year old Allie obsessing over her Grandfather's birthday cake to a ten year old Allie writing a letter to her 25-year old self in the future~~laugh out loud funny!  And wait until you read the stories about her dogs!  Brilliantly illustrated and belly-laugh inducing!  The author also takes on some darker adult subjects and in her own way finds a way to relate to all of us with that one-of-a-kind sense of humor.<br/><br/>Allie is also the illustrator.  Her cartoons are on the surface simplistic~~but look closely~~she nails expression.<br/><br/> This is a fun book filled with bright color and funny stories, some taken right from the author's blog and some new for the book.  I'd recommend this book for anyone looking to laugh with the exception of those folks who might be a little put off by a few f-bombs.<br/><br/>✰✰✰✰✰
this is the first time I have read such an accurate description of adolescence and depression with the inherent tragic humor included! Congratulations to Allie Brosh!! Truly an honest and talented artist.  love love love!  Bought it as a gift for multiple loved ones!!<br/>thank you Ms Brosh!
I've been a follower of Allie Brosh's website, so I knew what to expect, and this book did not disappoint.  In addition to some of the most popular stories from her website, Allie includes several new stories for this book.<br/><br/>She has a wonderful dry humorous tone, and her drawings perfectly match and complement the stories she's telling.  They range from childhood misadventures, to dog-related madness ("Dogs don't understand basic concepts like moving" is literally the funniest thing I have ever read in my life) to personal and very moving (her two stories relating her battle with depression).<br/><br/>I could not possibly recommend this book more highly!
I love Allie's work, and I LOVE this book - so nice to get to handle it in all its glory. She is brilliant, insightful, humble, and hilarious. I don't think I've ever seen anyone analyze their thinking with more insight or humor (or neurotic over-doing it!).<br/><br/>I'm so sorry that Alllie Brosh goes through the wretched pain of severe depression, but I think her contribution to the body of work about the illness is significant in its own quirky way.
I would have given more stars if only I felt it was long enough.<br/>know it had to end --> angry at book for ending despite seeing a definite end at bottom of kindle screen--> angrily review with one less star to show illogical feeling<br/><br/>:) i would give my pinky finger to see and meet the two dogs in person
I loved this book!!  It probably has one the best and most real accounts of depression I have ever read, but Ms  Brosh does it in such a way that captures her humour and humanity that everyone can relate and enjoy. A classic read and the best of 2013!!
This book had me laughing so hard during a cardio workout I had to stop reading or I'd never finish.. Very entertaining!
Really! This review thingies is making me write at least 20 words. I really, really, REALLY, really liked this book. The end.
I was lucky enough to chance upon this woman's blog, learn about her book, then put myself on the "notify" list.  Clearly, this woman would be an interesting study for a psychoanalyst, and is clearly a bit out of the normal sphere of reality, but then so am I and all my jellyfish friends so we like her and are eagerly awaiting the film
The book is funny, different, more than once I felt "Oh, this is me!"<br/>Some of the drawings are touching and describe the feelings of the story.<br/>As somebody not particularly inclined to comics I enjoyed it very much
This book is more than I hoped it would be. I was a huge fan of the blog and couldn't wait for this book to be released. I laughed a lot. It also made me feel awesomely uncomfortable at times because it is so damn honest and real. I loved every second of it. I'm gonna read it again right now. Bye.
Digital comic art at its most expressive!!! Very relatable. I am a huge fan of this author / artist. Insightful and hilarious
Read it in 2 days-couldn't put it down. Wish there was more. Hysterical! Going to check out her blog right now.
All genuine humor is backed by the lurking possibility of tumbling into an abyss.  In Ms. Brosh's case, the abyss is the dark tunnels of her own mind.  In the chapters on "Identity" I can see myself as well as a number of close family members, so I take the author's observations as far-reaching, if not universal.  Her take on the quirkiness of her dogs is a dog-lover's picnic and the illustrations are iconic.  I read both the print (heavy, slick, colorful and a joy to behold) and e-book (keeps the great illustrations and colors and was much easier to carry on the plane).
This book reads a bit like stand-up comedy. If you like Arrested Development, you will absolutely love this. And while the author focuses on subjects like her not-so-clever dogs and her own childhood antics, several of the chapters touch on weighty themes like depression and being a bad person in refreshing and interesting ways. Highly, highly recommend.
I read this book in less than two days. It was so entertaining and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a laugh. The way she describes depression is about as spot on as I've ever heard but still extremely funny. Great, great read!
.....because that is where I read this. Not my usual choice of book, but I took a break from heavier historical fiction to read this one, which I found by accident on Amazon . Loved it!
Hilarious and insightful. Can even be funny about depression and suicidal thoughts if you can believe that. I drew comics as a kid to communicate with my friends. Too bad I didn't see it through like this. This is a great book!
I borrowed this book from a friend, and I'm glad I did. This book had me laughing until tears streamed from my eyes from start to finish. I enjoyed this book thoroughly, and only gave it four stars for the fact that it was too short. The artwork was quirky and fun to look at, and the diction Allie Brosh used was hilarious. The stories were relatable, and somewhat nostalgic in places. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to laugh and have fun.
Quirky pictures, funny situations all while looking at what makes you human. Deep thoughts but in a fun way of looking at life. Describes depression in an amazingly true way. Loved it!
This is my favorite book to pick up and make me laugh anytime. Truly entertaining. I love her writing style.
I am so glad I bought this. Allie is like a kindred spirit to me. You will die laughing at these stories.
Allie knows how to make me laugh, and to laugh at my own quirks as she draws and muses on her own. Well done, Allie. Fan for life!
Laughed the whole time, very witty and funny! I would recommend this book to anyone looking to forget their worries and smile :)
Allie tells stories of her life in a way that makes you able to relate, & laugh. the pictures she creates add a whole extra layer. Great book.
If you've ever giggled at Allie's website Hyperbole and a Half, you will love this book.  It includes a few favorites and a whole slew of new content.  I won't spoil too much, but Helper Dog plays an interesting role in said new content. ;)
Hyperbole and a Half was hilarious, an  I could relate to just about everything. Although, on  thing I noticed that a lot of the stories were on the blog, so it reduced the length because I`d read most of them. But I loved the drawings, and sarcasm. Great book. I`d recommend it to just about anyone.
There are plenty of blogs out there that combine drawings and text but Hyperbole is easily my favorite. This book is well worth your time with a great collection of new and old stories that are hilarious and touching.
Was excited when I found out there was a book out there. Ever since a friend introduced me to this I would always read it online.
I have dogs. I've been depressed. She made me laugh. She made me cry. She writes from the heart and her drawings are delightful.
OK, so as a fan, I knew this book was going to make me laugh out loud, but I didn't expect the simple & spot-on incite about depression.  I bought one for myself & 2 others as Xmas gifts!
Have read a few on her blog already, but still made me crack up laughing uncontrollably. To the awkward glances from people around..
I laughed out loud through most of the book. Allie Brosh is tremendously funny, articulates well, and draws amusing illustrations.
Not only is this book laugh-out-loud funny, but it also features themes that hit you in the stomach like a truth brick. A great, great read that can be tackled in a day.
You might think you have read this all before on the website, but there is alot here you have not seen. :-)
It's good to know there are others out there....<br/><br/>Pictures, depictions of scenarios...all hilarious and perfect!<br/><br/>Hope there's more where that came from!
If you like the blog, you'll love the book. More of the same hilarious, relatable stories. Don't skimp by getting the Kindle edition, go with the real thing.
i fear there is a group of misfits in this world that are starting to communicate in comic form. Amazing how many times i felt the author had been living in my shoes.
My only complaint is that I'm done reading this book, I laughed so hard at so many of the stories. The book is just a collection of Brosh's stories complete with her oh so wonderful illustrations. The God of Cake is my first memory of her work, and it's in the book, along with some excellent stories about her dogs, other childhood adventures, and some very open and honest looks at depression. She is one of my favorites, and I look forward to reading more.
A good, fun read that's easy to pick up and read for a few minutes and then come back to later. Made me laugh out loud at a few points and made me laugh to myself the whole way through. No real narrative, but I want expecting there to be at all.
Ms. Brosh's humour is contagious.  I laughed so hard when I read this book that I woke up my entire household.  Her illustrations perfectly compliment her wit, and I have started reading her blog as a result of this book.  Her writing style is brilliant.
I wish I could check more than five stars for this book. It's one of the funniest books I've ever read. I particularly recommend this for dog lovers.
Hyperbole and a Half has been my favorite blog since I stumbled upon it. Allie describes it adventures in a human and realisticly heart wrenching manner with her words and of course, her epic comics.
There's not a lot more to say about Allie Brosh because everyone is already talking about her and how amazing she is. She wins Teh Internets on a daily basis. Read her book.
Awesome.  Hilarioius and totally relatable.  I read the blog now.  It's nice to read about someone who can make light of her struggles.
A friend sent me a link several years ago to Allie's blog about her retarded dog. I tried to read it out loud to my boyfriend, but I laughed too hard for him to make any sense of what I was reading. I've followed her avidly since then, and I am in awe of her willingness to reveal stuff the rest of us hide deep deep down, so deep we don't even tell our therapists. She is amazing, funny, and I loved her book and drawings. And I'm really glad I don't have her dogs.
Laugh out loud funny and painfully true! Her drawings put it over the top. Do not read in public if you want to save your dignity!
I feel like I've been waiting forever for this book! There is some repeat content from her blog, but lots of new stories too. She literally has me laughing out loud, almost to the point of tears, in many of her stories. I love Allie, MS Paint, and the simple dog!
I really enjoyed this book. I thought it was a funny approach to some serious and some laughable moments in life. I wish I could write like this. I really love the goose story.
Absolutely worth the read. I was skeptical going into it but was quickly rolling around laughing so hard and enjoying every page.
If you are a fan of Allie's blog, or even if you've never read it, this book is great.  It's funny, it's touching, it's sometimes serious, but all delivered in an expressively sketched way.  Overall a really enjoyable book.
I enjoyed the author's website and the book didn't disappoint. Not to be missed is her amusingly accurate portrayal of the depression sufferer.
I'm an avid reader of Allie's blog, Hyperbole and a Half, so I've been counting the days till her book came out. As usual,I laughed at all of her wonderful stories and crazy drawings. It's a fantastic book. The only negative is that about half of the stories are on the blog. I enjoyed reading them again, but I would really love all new material. Time for a second book!!!
Hilarious and honest. I was disappointed when it ended, I wanted to read more. Hope Allie comes back to blogging more soon.
Loved the blog and loved the book. I don't buy many books but as soon as I saw this, I didn't even have to think about it. Bought it right away and wasn't disappointed!
It amused me in so many ways but in not so many words. Only five more words left. Yes hoo!
Just wonderful, this is a compilation of her works online, which are always fun to re-read, and new stories, which had my face hurting from laughing.  Allie never dissapoints!
Devastatingly funny; heartbreakingly self-revealing.  In particular, "Identity" reminded me of the kind of soul-searingly painful self-awareness work we did in seminary.  To see it there with pictures, laid out for the whole world, was humbling. Bravo, Allie!
I thought I had read every entry of her blog. Turns out, I hadn't. This is basically a compilation of the best blog entries she's ever posted. So freakin hilarious.
Allie Brosh is hilarious! I cried with laughter while reading this book. It features the "greatest hits" from her website along with some great new stories. These simple drawings really pack a punch. It's a quick read but one I'm looking forward to reading over and over again!
I already loved her blog and this is just more of the same. Love the drawings, she's very funny, and I'm so glad I ordered this. It's not as much fun on my Kindle since I don't have the color, but I'm planning to buy a few of these books to give as gifts. Great purchase!
I am now frightened. She exposed the bad parts of my mental makeup. Why? I was battling those demons just fine until you let them out . Now everyone will know what I'm like and what's wrong with me. My delusional life is shattered. Thank you for writing this beautiful and honest look into our minds.
Excellent presentation, with the unique writing and handrawing from Allie, I have had a lot of fun with this book, even though English is not my native language, I love this book.
Loved this book. Love her blog. Laughed out loud. I can't wait for Allie to have kids and write about those experiences too!
It's nice to know that there is at least one other person that is more messed up than I am!
Allie's book is intensely personal.  She shares about her depression, suicide, and bad dogs.  Tragic, evocative, darkly funny.  I'm ready for her next book
Great read for all,the sketches are expressive and provide comic relief. Easy to finish even with a busy schedule.it was worth every penny.
Laughed until I cried,  very funny read! Allie could be me as she relates her feelings and adventures. Whether in words or pictures, there is an unmistakable sense of self and humour. Loved it!
I LOVE Allie Brosh. I follow her blog religiously, even through her 18 month hiatus while she fought crippling depression. The only complaint I have about this book is that it is too short. I can never get enough of her writing! If you like Jenny Lawson (TheBloggess), you'll love Allie.
The kind of read that is laugh out loud funny! But not the kind of comedy you have to think too hard to 'get'.
I love what Allie chooses to write about and the illustrations are probably my favorite part. Laughed out loud, probably in several inappropriate social situations while reading on my phone. Loved it!
I laughed so hard I cried. Allie Brosh has a unique gift to write and illustrate (in the most hilarious way) the things that we all think but are too afraid to say out loud. There was only one issue I had with the book - it was too short!! I hope that Allies writes another book! Thank Allie for this book and all of your posts.
20 more words are required before I'm able to submit this review and oops now there's only like three left yay! Enjoy book ...
Her comics are soo refreshing!  She's not piggy backing off anyone else's work, I don't even think she's aware of anyone else's work.<br/><br/>This book is just comics based of her child hood experiences, they are totally unique and original; she's from her own planet.  I'm gonna call her weird and that is definitely praise, she is absolutely hilarious and wonderful!  What a quirky girl.
This book was laugh out loud funny as well as raw and honest. Incredibly insightful. Brosh opens her heart and writes the things you are thinking. It's hard to pick a favorite chapter, but the last one is fantastic.
It's been awhile seen something made me both laugh out loud while simultaneously tearing up. Love Allie and Hyperbole and a Half.
I'm a big fan of the blog and have really enjoyed the book. I laughed out loud repeatedly and once so hard I cried.
I have been a fan of Allie's for a while now, my favorite blog post of hers is "A Better Pain Scale" which I have seen in a doctor's office or two and they really owe Allie credit, and money!  Allie's book is amazing and it was worth waiting since July when I first put it on pre-order.  It's awesome on paper.
There's not much more to say. It's powerful where it needs to be and hilarious everywhere else. I loved it.
This is probably the best book that exists.  Buy two. Maybe three, just to be safe.<br/><br/>My boyfriend made fun of all the faces I made as I read it.
Allie is funny, sincere and brutally honest.  All of these things make this book a GREAT read...oh and of course the awesome illustrations don't hurt either.  There are many subjects in this book I identify with and they make me laugh out loud, typically around strangers who then look at me like I may have something wrong with me.  But, this book makes me not care.  Of course, there are things in this book that I CAN'T identify with, like the chapter about the goose (you will have to read this book to find out what that means).  Those chapters just made me laugh so hard, I cried.  I hope Allie writes more books, if she does, I'll buy those too.
Hilarious with some serious bits that sneak in and stick with you. I have not read any of Allie Brosh's writing before but I will be catching up on her blog now.
I, like many people, was a fan of Brosh's blog before buying the book.  You don't need to already be a fan, though, to appreciate it; two seconds of reading anything she's ever written should make you an insta-fan, and if it doesn't, I'm sorry, your sense of humor is broken.  Brosh is not only hilarious, but also very insightful and relatable.  You should buy this book for yourself, and then get a copy for everyone you know.
This is a funny book. Really funny. So funny, if you are eating it while eating, you might start laughing at the wrong time and start to ... well, not to put too fine a point on it, you might start to die. I learned two things: 1. The light isn't really white, it's a bunch of different colors, very pretty. 2. Heimlich HURTS when it's done to you. 3. Reading H&.5 is totally worth the danger!
I've read Allie's blog for quite some time and have been waiting for more. I devoured this book and hated when I had to put it down to sleep and work. My husband would give me serious side eye when I would snort laugh through each chapter. Loved this!
I laughed, I cried, I discovered parts of myself that I thought had sold long ago, all thanks to this great book. Anyone with a dog and eyeballs should purchase this.
Allie Brosh combines her unusually keen insight with extreme candor and her laser-sharp sense of humor and illustrates it with cartoon drawings that always capture and enhance the essence of her point. If, like me, you're a long-time reader of her blog, you will recognize several of the essays from there, but you won't mind re-reading them. in fact, you might re-RE-read them, because they are some of her best work. And the new material in the book was so worth waiting for. Allie hit a homerun with this book and I hope she continues to write, whether on her blog or for future publications.
Allie you are my hero. Always love the simple and helper dogs and never stop buying corn. We may need you to find some more
I recommend this book! It's funny and poignant (sometimes simultaneously). The art is fun and the dogs are the best.
This was a great book and worth the long wait. I really enjoyed the humor, the drawings and Brosh's wry take on life. More please.
When is book 2 coming out??? :)<br/>I love the original blog as well and can't wait for more!! Just know I'll be stalking the blog homepage.
Love the blog, and love the book. It honours some of the classic stories from the blog and contains lots of new stories too. Could read it over and over and still laugh.
I love allow and her blog. Her description of depression resonates so well and I love her dog stories. The new material was excellent, especially about the goose.
I have been waiting and waiting and waiting...clutching my 'Parp' mug with anticipation for this book to come out. Its hilarious, painfully relate-able and the dogs are perfect. The drawings alone make me laugh out loud, and the writing is fantastic. Don't miss out!!!
I pre-ordered this book months ago when Allie first announced it... it showed up yesterday and I was ecstatic! The book itself is beautiful with all of the different colors, and the content is even better. There is a lot of new material that is awesome, but reading the stuff from the blog again is just as enjoyable.<br/><br/>EVERYTHING IS SPIDERS
I was super excited to see my pre-ordered copy arrive yesterday, and thought that I'd bring it with me today while running errands and sitting in doctors' office waiting rooms. Big mistake. I was laughing to the point that my body was shaking and tears were running down my face and I'm pretty sure I snort-laughed a few times. I had to explain to the eye doctor that - no, nothing was actually wrong with my eyes, and it was this book, and it was making me cry, but because it was funny. Also, people in the waiting room were freaked out by this crazy woman convulsing and snorting in the corner.<br/><br/>One other comment, though - while this book was funny and insightful, I feel like she was being really unfair to herself in spots, like the Identity parts at the end (and I'm sure this is from the depression she's been suffering).
It's a bit of a fast read, because of the style of her blog, but the book is still nice and thick to accommodate for that. It's fun and it's so good to have some new Hyperbole to read and cheer me, while also having my favorite older blog posts right there in full color anytime I want without booting up anything. It's funny and cute and I can think of nothing about this book that isn't worth the full price. I would buy another book from her at full price. That's a hint. There's a reason this book is getting such great reviews, because it really IS All That.
Seriously, maybe the best book ever written. OK, Perhaps that's an exaggeration, but such FABULOUS stuff! YOU WILL LOVE THIS BOOK. If you don't, it is possible that you are dead.... or should be.....
As if the blog weren't amazing enough, here is the book, full of dogs, cake, dead fish and everything else that makes what Allie creates so dear to me. There is no one on the web who can make me laugh or nod more vigorously, or feel with more abandon. If you know anyone who has dogs, depression or a childhood, read it and then pass it along to them.<br/><br/>In other words, buy it, read it and pass it along. You will not regret it.
Wow...usual excellence in story telling from Allie Brosh. I loved the choice of favorites from the blog. Loved all the new stories. She is a true comedian.
I love Allie! This is a great compilation of old and new material. I highly recommend it to anyone who would like to laugh hysterically. I don't recommend reading this at work!!
This book was thoughtfully written, riddled with raw honesty and brilliant sarcasm, and accompanied by simple but poignant illustrations that never fail to evoke emotion. You'll laugh until you cry and cry until you laugh with every page in this book. Don't forget to follow her blog to make sure you read material that didn't make it into the book!
Now Hyperbole and a Half can go with me everywhere. It's like a new dimension, reading the blog bits in the treebook - plus the new parts are just as top-drawer. The plain-spoken stories and uncomplicated drawings make me laugh, cry. The Depression chapters are right on target, and you can tell Allie is a Real Person because she gets dogs. the end
If you are thinking of buying the book, go to the blog and read a few posts.  If you like the posts then you will like the book.  If you would pay to read more posts like that, then you should buy the book.  I love the blog and love the book.  It was worth the money.  It made me laugh, and the deeper parts really hit home.  Allie Brosh is genius.
So wonderful. A good amount of new stories not from her blog, too. Her two stories about depression are fantastic if you or a friend are depressed and you need help understanding or explaining it. Love Allie Brosh so much. She's brilliant and hilarious. If you're looking for a present for your niece: buy this book and be her favorite aunt ever.
My 14 year old son absolutely loves this book. He is in hysterical fits of laughter every time he picks it up, so I asked him to read some of it to me. I found myself laughing as well and was thankful he bleeped the cuss words out for me so I didn't have to hear him drop the f-bomb. I wouldn't recommend for a young reader, but I would say 13+.
This book made me laugh (and cry) in equal measure. Her insight into the complexities of depression helped make me feel better about my own struggles, and she provided a fresh look at this dilemmas. The funny stories, especially about her dogs, made me literally laugh out loud ... which is something I have never experienced before with a book.
I am a huge fan of Hyperbole and a Half in blog form, so I rushed to buy this when it was out.  Very funny, of course, as per usual.  My only critique is that about half the comics in the book were on the website, so if you're already a devoted fan -- as most buyers of this book probably will be -- you've already read half the book's material.
A wonderfully hilarious collection of stories not to be underestimated. A surprisingly accurate depiction of depression, A.D.D. and other crazy workings of the human mind. Presented in an uplifting and comical way that caters to these disorders even as far through its physical design. This little gem will follow you long after you've read it.
Can she just be my best friend? Her stories and photos are hysterical. My stomach and cheeks hurt from laughing so hard. She also delves into some pretty dark topics like depression, but still manages to make them entertaining. There is something that just feel familiar, comforting and hilarious about her stories. Can you tell I'm a huge fan?
Others have done a much better job than I ever could of conveying just WHY Allie's writing (and drawing) is so funny. So I just figured I'd chime in to confirm everything else they've said. I was a regular reader of her blog and yes, some material is repeated in the book, but it's still just as funny (and there's plenty of new material too).
Allie Brosh has a voice that comes through clearly in her writing, as though I am having a very funny conversation with her.  She even tackled the topic of depression in a way that drew me into her ordeal but still left me laughing.  I have been a blog reader of hers for years and am delighted to have the book!  What an enjoyable experience.
Great balance of humor with a little more serious edge.  I was laughing so hard that people on the bus/ plane/ train where looking at me funny.  I'd shake the bed while reading in bed next to my significant other <He was not amused>.  In addition to the humor, the chapter on depression really helped me understand depression better.
I cry when I read this, for all the right reasons - laughter, sadness, moments of clarity. Allie is an incredible person who has killed me dead with her stories of Simple Dog (so much so, my husband thought I was in cardiac crisis at one point). I look forward to more from her! I've purchased this as gifts, and received thanks for that. :)
I've had this book on my wish list since I first heard it was coming out. I finished reading it yesterday and it was much bleaker than I imagined from the reviews. Her drawings are hilarious, and I like the physical book: the paper is thick, the chapters form a rainbow on the outside of the book, and the back cover is very funny. Some of the chapters are funny, and the depression ones are spot-on, but some just didn't seem that interesting. Maybe if I had dogs I would be into those sections more. And maybe I'm just remembering the last chapter, which seemed dull and kind of a downer. I'll have to re-read it. I just remember receiving it a few days ago and thinking of cool people I know that I could give the book to as gifts; after finishing it I don't really plan to give it to anyone. I recommend the blog over the book.
1. I saw this sentence under "Recent discussions in the Hyperbole and a Half....." comment section below as I tried to formulate something that accurately conveyed my feelings about this book.  So yes, I am swiping your comment, B.R.  It is perfect.<br/><br/>2. The few negative reviews on this book are unintentionally hilarious.
Hysterical and heartfelt content in a beautifully produced book. Can't recommend it enough. I could read stories about Helper Dog and Simple Dog forever. Brosh is brutally honest with both herself and the reader as she describes some of the challenges she has in life, but at the same time always seems to find the humor in every situation.
This book is awesome! Having suffered from depression myself, I relate to so many of her stories. In fact I've never read a more accurate description of depression. If you've ever had depression, or know someone who does, and you want to understand what they're going through, get this book! Plus it's funny and engaging. Highly recommend!
The Depression sections made me cry. Not just a few dignified tears, but gasping sobs of recognition and empathy. And then the "shriveled corn kernel under the fridge" section made me laugh, maybe as hard as the author laughed. My first graphic novel, and I think it was a wise choice. Bravo to Allie for putting it all out there.
Hilarious. I have been waiting for months for Allie's book to come out and was not disappointed! The only thing I would be sad about is she didn't include the "Wolves" story which is on her blog (check it out, it's a great entry) but all of her other material is there. At times emotionally moving, but mostly laugh out loud fun.
It's nice to know that we aren't a new brand of scary and weird. Just the normal amount. This has also been the best description of depression that I've ever read/seen.<br/><br/>Her delivery, irreverence, and unflinching (sort of) opinion of herself make this book a must read, a must have, and always at the top of your 're-read list
Okay, you need to invest in some Depends before you read this book.  And if you've ever suffered from life-threatening depression, this is a must read.  I even gave my 11 year old dog the object constancy portion of the canine intelligence test, and she found the doggy treat under the paper cup.  I only wish the author had cats also.
Long awaited, lots of extras not on the web!
I started reading this blog in 2010, and have loved her work ever since. The topics, thoughts and feelings are so real, even the bad ones, but somehow she still makes you laugh out loud, even when the subject isn't necessarily funny. I would recommend her blog, and this book, to anyone. I can't wait until she publishes the next one!
I can't remember the last time a book made me laugh out loud as I was reading it. This really was one of the best purchases I've made in a long time and I'm so glad that my best friend suggested it (and that I listened to her!). The quirky drawings are amusing and the stories are very relate-able, which Is why I enjoyed it so much.
As someone who is depressed, likes dogs, and was a child one time, this book was right up my alley. I read the website while it was up, and was relieved to see my depression feelings put into words and pictures that were both funny and accurate. I so appreciate Allie Brosh's work and her honesty. And her drawings. Oh, the drawings.
I've loved Hyperbole and a Half for quite a while now. Allie does an amazing job bringing humor to serious situations. Her honesty about her struggle with depression is something not everyone could muster to do and she does it beautifully. Her humor is AMAZING and literally every time I read one of her comics, I laugh until I cry.
the.<br/><br/>best.<br/><br/>Stayed up too late like a little kid because I couldn't stop reading and laughing. Allie Brosh does both funny and funny-cuz-it's-true really well...So, even if you can't related first-hand, you will fall out of your chair laughing...and if you can relate, well, there will be laughing and crying...
Equally hilarious and emotionally moving. If you've ever experienced depression you should own this book. If you've ever owned a dog you should own this book. If you've ever been a child you should own this book. If you've ever been a human you should own this book. (Or semi-human.) My 9-year-old says, "She speaks to me."
I loved following this blog for years and eagerly awaited the day when this book would come out, and MAN does it not disappoint. Brava, Allie. Hilarious and poignant at times, this book is just full of funny moments and moments that touch your heart. Thanks for sharing, Allie - you've made my day too many times to count.
Not only did I laugh aloud like a crazy person in public while reading this, it was so funny that for a bit, I didn't even care what others thought! This book made me feel better about my own "fundamental shittiness" and allowed me to have more compassion for myself. A must read for everyone on the spectrum of neuroses!
This woman is truly gifted.  Both the text and the drawings are just incredibly good.<br/>You MUST download this book.  (It is also out in paperback, but IMHO they<br/>ruined this masterpiece with too much color - it actually detracts from the whole.)<br/><br/>So download this book immediately!  You'll love it too!
I absolutely loved this book. I had been reading the blog Hyperbole and a Half for a few years and this book is more of the same type of stories. There are a few repeat stories from the blog, but they are ones I love to read again and again (Motivation, Testing Dog's Intelligence, etc.). I heartily recommend this book!
So great!!  Not only did I laugh out loud but my hard-to-humor hubby did too. The dog stories are hysterical and the cartoon illustrations are priceless. A great gift for any dog owner/lover, especially if they happen to be the depressive carry-the-weight-of-the-world kind. This could make Debbie Diwner crack a smile.
I LOVE Allie Brosh!  Her blog is so hilarious, and this is a great compliment to her blog.  I would say I still like the computer as the best vehicle for her work, but if you had never seen her blog you would LOVE this all the same.  Her screwball humor is charming and her illustrations have me rolling with laughter.
This book is so exceptionally good that I have purchased 5 copies of it, 1 for myself and 4 others as gifts to people that NEED to see the wisdom and hilarity of Allie Brosh.  I have been a huge fan and all it too was 1 time reading her blog at hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com, she is awesome! So glad the book is out!
I stumbled into the world of Hyperbole and a Half on my computer one morning and never wanted to leave.  Whenever I'm having a bad day, or even when I'm not, I open the book to "The God of Cake" and laugh until my cheeks and/or belly hurts.<br/><br/>Allie, the world is a better place with your book in it.
I totally enjoyed this comic narrative from Allie Brosh. It goes from the mundane, to the absurd to serious matter of mental illness with heart and soul. This is a great read for anyone struggling with depression, wants to understand it, or just wants to take a moment and find humor in the ordinary moments in life.
I've been a reader of the Hyperbole and a Half Blog for a decent amount of time, and was thrilled to buy this book. Many posts come from the blog, but somehow the colors and flow of the stories are really enhanced by this books format. The writing is witty and sincere as always. A great addition to any living room.
I'm a 45 year old man & I loved this book. My 7 year old son enjoyed it too although I had to change a few of the naughty words. I have also given this as a gift to several people who all loved it (at least they were polite enough enough to tell me they did). Very, very funny despite some rather downbeat subjects.
Brosh is, as always, a joy to read. I would have given it five stars if this book had been all new material, but some of the chapters are old posts from her blog of the same name.<br/><br/>Her illustrations make everything 10 times more hilarious than it would be otherwise. This is a great read and a great gift.
Awesome, laughter-inducing book.  I love how she can take the hardest subjects (depression) and STILL have me laughing out loud.  I drive my family crazy wanting to read them the stories.  My 3 yr old even likes it because of her adorable illustrations.  Honest and hilarious, true to the blog, just genius writing.
Allie is amazing and the things she makes are both poignant and also make me laugh till I cry.  This book does have a lot of overlap from her website, but I'm more than happy to financially support someone who puts so much of herself into her work and is able to enunciate difficult things like clinical depression.
I love this blog and the book is a great collection of some of my favorite posts and some new material. Good quality printing and binding. I bought three copies this year as gifts. Besides some language, I would recommend to anyone. The author is really thoughtful in her balance of humor with some serious issues.
I love the illustrations and the thought process of Allie Brosh! I even took the book to my mom's house and she asked if she could borrow it. I didn't expect this to happen with a graphic novel type of book! The paper is glossy -- perfect for showing off the clever and descriptive illustrations. I love this book!
Allie is hilarious and reading her blog and this book can really make you laugh even if you're feeling down. She's someone who knows what it's like to be depressed and doesn't sugar coat anything. Instead she puts her problems out there for you to see and it's refreshing to be able to relate to an author so well.
Based on a blog of the same name, this book is an illustrated memoir about dogs, cake, childhood, self-discipline, self-loathing, and depression. The collection is a little uneven, but when Brosch’s deliberately crude Paintbrush essays hit their darkly comic sweet spot, they’ll make you laugh so hard, you’ll cry.
I'd never heard of Alley Brosh before reading Hyperbole and a Half.  Now I'm a huge fan.  She's deeply flawed and seriously funny, a messy human who ingeniously conveys all the complexities of life in crudely simple drawings.  I laughed out loud throughout the book, and only the best can bring out the loud ones.
I've always been a long time reader of Allie's blog. It never fails to make a bad day feel slightly better. I finally bought her book and was pleasantly surprised at how heavy and nice the quality of the paperback book was. Highly recommend and like her blog, this book doesn't disappoint. I like this book alot.
Yay Allie!<br/><br/>Thanks for your personal awareness and awkwardness! Literally laughed out loud at each chapter, sometimes more than once! The rudimentary illustrations are still ridiculously rich with detail to accentuate the oddball anecdotes. We need more! Book part two?<br/><br/>PARP
The only think I would change is including the hilarious fish story from her blog. Also be warned that there is some foul language, so not for just any age group. But one of the most entertaining coffee table/comic strip books I've read. My wife and I were laughing until it was hard to breathe.
I love her, love the way her mind works, can't get enough of her stories and her descriptions.  This is worth it.  I do wish they'd published the book on paper that's an inch wider than it is.  It's so thick that you really have to press it flat just to read the words that are near the binding.
I love Hyperbole and a Half, and I was thrilled to see the book. Most of the book was as hysterical as the blog, and I spent those stories giggling my guts out. However, it ended on a really negative note, and the last two stories barely made me crack a smile. I wish they hadn't been included.
I was initially very excited to have received this from myself for Christmas (thanks, self!) only now I feel as if Allie has failed me.<br/><br/>I cannot communicate the sheer excitement and wonder I felt to be finally holding this book in my hands.  Despite having a family that obviously expected to spend some time with me on Christmas Day, I found myself holed up in my bedroom (and at times, the bathroom), unable to put this @#$ @#$! book down.  I finished it in one sitting.<br/><br/>Afterwards, I felt empty inside.  Empty because I'd enjoyed this book so much, a book I'd promised myself I would enjoy one chapter at a time, savoring the delightful anecdotes and sage reflections which originally drew me into Allie's blog and have kept me coming back for more -- hungrily... like, velociraptor hungrily -- ever since.  Instead, I yielded all self-control and ended up binging on this work.<br/><br/>If my brain were like a dog and I had the option of regurgitating the experience of this book and then re-ingesting my own brain-spew, I would do so over and over and over again.  However, my brain is not like a dog, and even if this were a possibility, I imagine it could only be accomplished a finite number of times before my brain completely turned to mush.<br/><br/>Which brings me back to my original point: that I feel Allie has in some way failed me.  No, I take that back; the truth is that she has failed us all.<br/><br/>It's downright cruel to force someone to transition from the highly pleasurable state of Reading This Book to the dull and empty state of No Longer Reading This Book.  True, Hyperbole and a Half can and most certainly will be read over and over and over again, but the effect just isn't quite the same.  It's the difference between meeting someone new and exciting (before the novelty of it wears off and you discover they were lying about their marital status) and visiting old friends.  You'd better believe I'll be revisiting this book, but I still want more.  From Allie Brosh.  A Part Two.  NOW.<br/><br/>If Allie truly cared about her fans, she would have found some means of communicating with her future self (like, her super-distant future self -- from so far into the future that half her organs are made of synthetic materials and the other half have been cloned from canine stem cells) instructing her future self to send all future volumes of the Hyperbole and a Half book series back in time to Christmas 2013 so that they may be enjoyed sequentially and without delay, thus sparing us the dreadful inconvenience of waiting for Allie to write material before we can read it.<br/><br/>But Allie didn't do this.  Thus, she has failed.  Which means that she must not truly love us -- or that her future self does not have access to a time machine and/or synthetic canine organs with which to preserve her life indefinitely (or at least until time machines have been invented).  But that is a possibility I refuse to accept.<br/><br/>I'm rating this book five stars, because that's the lowest rating I can give... right??
This book very succinctly describes depression and how it makes no sense.  As someone that has struggled with depression most of my life I found this book to be uplifting.  It made me feel as though someone else knows what I have been dealing with and that made me feel better about all of it.
This was a fun book. There were lots of times I was laughing out loud like a Hyena and my friends had to tell me to stop it - I was making the rest of the plane uncomfortable. Great for a lightweight read at the beach, on holidays or around the house. Definitely recommend for a giggle or two.
Allie Brosh is a super creative story teller.<br/>Her art is simple, but highly expressive, and her writing style fits the sentiments of the times.<br/>When reading her stories, you feel like a friend.<br/><br/>My sister has 'borrowed' my copy - and I will totally buy one to replace it.
This book is hilarious! Once in a while I'll enjoy a light read and this book surpassed my expectations. It was entertaining from beginning to end and now I wish there were more. Anyone looking for a fun, comical and easy book to read, this one just about does it. Would highly recommend it!
I've followed her blog, and it's great to see some of the best of her blog but also a majority of new stories we've not heard yet. Allie is always fun, quirky, sometimes dancing on the edge of being disturbingly real. She reminds us that we are not alone in our own weirdness. I love Allie!
Allie Brosh is one of the funniest writers out there and Hyperbole and a Half is a well-curated collection of her best. The stories vary between silly, hilarious, ridiculous, and intelligently introspective, all brilliantly written. I look forward to more work from her in the future.
This book had some of Allie's best stories from her blog (although my favorite, The Year Kenny Loggins Ruined Christmas wasn't included), many others like The God of Cake and The Simple Dog kept me laughing. This book is an awesome companion for readers of the blog and new converts.
A laugh-out-loud, poignant walk through the author's self-reported life anecdotes.  She nails her portrayal of her dogs - who remind me of mine.  The drawings are perfect - extremely economical yet expressive.  I've given this book as a gift more than once, and probably will again.
Now. Don't even question it. Just buy it. You will read it, likely in one or two sittings, and love every second. Allie Brosh is amazing and hilarious and her ability to deal with tough issues through humor is unmatched. I never want to live in a world without hyperbole and a half.
This woman is a genius. Her humor is so self-deprecating and yet somehow uplifting! I love it. These stories are going to brighten your day, anytime you need a laugh, just turn to this book! The quality of the book is impressive too, all in color and the pages are thick and glossy.
this book is set up the same way as her website & if you are a long time Allie follower you will recognize some of the stories.  She does have new content & while I was rereading some I was laughing so hard I was crying & having trouble breathing.<br/>Definitely worth purchasing!!
Some of this I have seen before on her blog, but its ok because I laughed just as hard the second time around. She is probably one of the funniest female writers/artist/cartoonists around. A word of caution for parents- there's some major curse words, so its not for young children.
I have loved Allie's blog for ages and we happily purchased her book.  The writing is hilarious but the pictures really make it.  If you have loved dogs, grappled with your own awkwardness, struggled with depression, or if you simply have a sense of humor - you will like this book.
I have been a huge fan of Allie Brosh for a while now, and it was great seeing her come back to her blog and also put out this book. It's a great read (both old and new comics) and I think it would make a great gift for anyone who has enjoyed her drawings/blog postings in the past.
I would have preferred less profanity in this book, however the content had me laughing so hard my sides hurt. There were parts that were raw and real and told in a way that I completely understood and related to. I grew to love this woman I've never met. Definitely worth reading!
AWESOME BOOK!  Pee your pants funny.
Laugh out loud funny! She somehow even makes you laugh at depression, while never once making light of it. She describes what it's like so perfectly, and in the next moment you find yourself laughing even amid the horror.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this book highly enough!
I've enjoyed the Hyperbole and a Half web column for a long time. This book has some favorites from there and new stuff, too. I thouroughly enjoyed re-reading the pieces I was familiar with, as well as the new ones,  and then sharing them with family and friends in book form.
I was a little disappointed that Kenny Loggins didn't make the cut. It was one of her funniest bits ([...]<br/><br/>I hope Brosh makes money on her book, because her blog was so great. God, I hope she writes another.<br/><br/>Props to her for talking about her depression.
I didn't realize that the book format was in a comic form (just as the blog). It didn't matter though once I started reading. Super funny and entertaining. The author has a knack for describing dog behavior that leaves me laughing with tears running down my face every time!
I would like to compare this book as a very good classic episode of M*A*S*H.  Plenty of parts where you laugh out-loud, and parts of poignancy where you nod your head knowingly/understandingly and maybe even shed an empathetic tear.  But mostly laugh.  Highly recommended!
I have never laughed out loud so much while reading. It's really the illustrations that do it. I do have to say that half the time when I finished a short, I was thinking "wait was there some deep take away I was supposed to get?" Regardless, totally entertaining.
As always, Allie is never dull.  Most of the stories are from her web blog, but they are classics.  The book was much larger than I had anticipated which was nice.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this to anyone with a sense of humor about themselves and life in general.
Some new stories, some old - all were absolutely nessescary for the book to work. Allie Brosh is an incredible story teller, and her MS paint style drawings suit her writings immensely well. If you have not picked up this book, you are doing yourself a severe disservice.
I've always been a Hyperbole and a Half fan, so I had to get this book!<br/><br/>I very much enjoyed it, even if my favorite stories were ones I already had read on the blog. I'm very happy for Allie's success, but I read it quickly and I doubt I will pick it up again.
Does Allie Brosh live in my head? What a delight and how refreshing to identify with whacky and adorable characters... I had to put the book down when I read the doggie chapters. In my case.. people could die laughing.. amazingly poignant and honestly funny.. thank you!
My daughter recommended this book and so I bought it.  Then I bought 2 more as gifts.  Everyone needs a good laugh and this book delivers.  Allie has a talent for taking everyday things and making them shine. (Not to mention the illustrations are perfect for this book).
I've enjoyed Allie's blog for a while and was excited to see that she was writing a book. I think it came out well. There were a few stories from the blog and a bunch of new stories. All very funny and entertaining. This was a pretty quick read and well worth the price.
Love the illustrations and somewhat comforted yet terrified at the same time that so much was relatable to how my own mind works. THANKS A. BROSH for messing w my mind! My mind security guard is now named Allie, she'd hang with Eric and mock us both over a frosty beer.
You will be able to relate to this character more than you are comfortable with.<br/>Allie keenly illustrates what it's like to be a young person in today's world. Filled with amusing illustrations and wit, read in a sound-proof room to muffle your bursts of laughter.
Allie Brosh has an amazing ability to laugh in the face of tragedy. She finds the humor in even the most desperate situations. Instead of "someday we'll look back at this and laugh," Allie makes you laugh right away.<br/><br/>And, there are cute dog stories!
I've been a fan of Hyperbole and a Half and Allie's writings for years. Her book was filled with some of my favorite stories in addition to some new ones. I don't think anyone else could make depression such an easy thing to talk about. I'm so glad I have this book!!!
Absolutely fantastic! I've been a reader of the blog for a few years now, and having the new stories in there alone made it worth the cost! But it's so nice to have a copy of all my favorites, like "God of Cake", so even without the internet I can read them :)
It didn't include some of the funnier stories from the blog site, but it did include a few that, as far as I have read, weren't on her blog. It would definitely a good coffee table book. It's a quick read for anyone who has a few minutes for some hilarious anecdotes!
This book is hilarious. I recommended going to the author's website to "preview" some of the comics to see if you like this type of humor. But reading all of the best comics back to back snuggled on my couch... I started getting tummy cramps laughing so hard.
This book makes me laugh out loud--something almost no books have accomplished. I try reading to my husband, but am laughing too hard to be understood. Everyone I have given this book to has thanked me repeatedly.  Excellent way to end the day--with belly laughs!
If you love her blog, you are gonna love the content of the book. The only minor problem I had was with the binding: it was a little too tight so the book was hard to hold in your hand while reading. A loose binding would have been better. But, still, five stars.
Allie Brosh has made a huge impact in turning around my own battle with depression. Having her rainbow colored book make my world better. I enjoy reading it over and over. Highly recommended for anyone who needs to laugh, cry, be happy or sad, or just in general!
She manages to express an astounding amount of emotion on the faces of awesome/creepy stick figures and adorably demented animals. Some of the book has already been posted on her website, but there is new content, too. And it is nice to read the comics in a book.
This was absolutely fantastic.  I just kept laughing out loud at it, and that is something I normally don't do.  I also found it pretty insightful and something that I could relate to.<br/><br/>This review is based on an ARC that was provided by the publisher.
This was a really funny fast read, but like the best comedy it can get dark and deep. I should probably be concerned that I saw so much of myself in this, but instead I'm cheered by the fact that someone as talented and twisted as the author is a kindred spirit.
A good gift for a friend who is dealing with depression and needs a laugh. Colorful! Super funny, just like her blog. Downside: It was pretty much reading a printed version of her blog. I was done in under an hour. Also, looks like my 7 year old did the layout.
If you are a fan of Allie Brosh, just get the dang book.  If you are unfamiliar with her work, just get the dang book, she's hilarious. Yes, most of this is available online, but the printed illustrations are great, and you'll be glad to have the tangible copy.
This is a wonderful book. I laughed out loud, smiled ear to ear, and got help with my own problems. Allie gives you a plethora of stories that are highly enjoyable and you can relate to the authors daily demises. And at the end of the day, we're all simple dog.
This is, without a doubt , the FUNNIEST book I have ever read, and I've read thousands of books and some of them were even sorta funny.  But THIS one is hilarious.  If you own a dog, it is a MUST read.  You will love Special Dog and Helper Dog.  READ THIS BOOK!
The simple, relatable humor of this book was just wonderful. Allie Brosh really did the world a favor when she wrote this book, it serves as a good reminder to us all not to take life too seriously and that there's always time for a good laugh. Great read!
A fan of Allie's toons and humor from her blog, I was thrilled to see it in book form! My only complaint is that even though I've read most of these already, I still have to suffer from embarrassment from snorting with laughter when reading this in public.
Six pages in I was laughing so hard I was crying.  My daughter loaned me this book and halfway through Imordered my own copy plus two more for gifts.  Thank you, Allie Brosh.  You are a hilarious story teller, even when dealing with topics like depression.
Allie's dark yet somehow uplifting comedic style and insight translates as well in hard-cover format as it does on the webpage.<br/>This book is a professionally bound and presented addition to any collection. Also, there is cake.<br/>Highly Recommended.
This book made me laugh until I snorted and cried. It also made me feel less horrible about the part of me that wants to push people. Plus I now see that one of my cats is simple.<br/>Some chapters are painfully easy to relate to which is a little scary.
Run, don't walk to get this book.
There are some stories in here that I can relate too alllllllll too well. Also, there are some stories that would be best served to read where it's safe - in the bathroom so when you laugh so hard and pee yourself, you won't need to change your britches.
Was kind of disappointed that I had already read a number of the comics on her website. I thought that this book would contain all new comics. Overall, it is very funny, just wish I had paid less for it since I read a bunch of the comics for free before.
This book was so funny; I was just in hysterics. I could barely breath I was laughing so hard and I developed a side stitch. Allie's descriptions on her childhood and current life are both humorous and insightful. I highly recommend this book to anyone.
I can't tell you how much I love her sense of humor and her amazingly expressive drawings. If I could give ten stars I would. I read her blog for quite some time and was sad when she stopped posting. I'm glad she published this and I hope she does more.
I am a long time fan of Allie Brosh and I bought this book happy in the knowledge that it would put my favorite blog posts out on my coffee table. I was happy to find some new entries as well! Great gift for anyone who enjoys life at all. BUY THIS BOOK!
Allie at her best - this book is a great look at not only Allie's personal memories, but patterns of behavior that I'm pretty sure we ALL have and those "flawed coping mechanisms" that everyone uses.<br/><br/>Just buy it.  Buy it for everyone.
Maybe half is stuff already from the blog, and there isn't much to begin with, but the new stuff is worth it, and the old stuff is still always funny. If nothing else, buy it to support Allie!
This author is remarkable ... though if you are considering this purchase, you likely already know it.  If you are unfamiliar with Allie Brosh, go check out her blog hyperboleandahalf.com ... pure genius.  Oh, and BUY THIS BOOK to support her artistry!
This is one of the best things I've spent money on all year. Allie is a genius. I must look crazy reading this on the train - constantly laughing out loud. If you're bothering to read this, do yourself and the world a favor and buy this book right now.
Phenomenal book!! Allie Brosh is always capable of putting a smile on my face with her writings, no matter how poorly my day is going!  She is hilarious, and has a wonderful way of looking at everything around her and putting it to words (and pictures)
I ordered this book months ago and when I got it it's was the most amazing surprise. I love her blog and the book is now something I can show to everyone so they can fall in love with Allie too!! I also cannot count how many stories relate to my life!
I'll start by saying before reading this book I had never read any of Allie Brosh's blog. I saw this book on a buzzfeed list and decided to give it a try. And I'm so happy I did, this book is funny, insightful, and above all else very human and real.
I used to be depressed but, through tons of work, I got over it. Changing things starting from the inside was my epiphany moment. Anyways, good book! If you cope with depression, this book will help you or at least make you smile and not feel alone!
Parts of the book will make you laugh out loud; others will make you ache for her. Allie is a unique treasure, someone who manages to deal with some very serious problems with humor and insight. I truly hope this is the first of many books from her.
Allie Brosh is hysterical. Even re-reading some of her stories I can't stop laughing. Her writing always seems familiar and is smart, funny, and goes through a range of emotions in a very real way, always with a big heaping dash of humor.
HYSTERICAL BOOK!  Highly recommended for anyone who takes themselves to seriously, is in counseling, has a mental illnesses, or knows someone with a mental illness, or just needs a good laugh...because we all get a little crazy sometimes!
My first graphic novel, which turned out to not be a novel but rather a collection of blog posts. I have mixed feelings because I usually don't enjoy characters full of self-pity but I enjoyed this book and laughed with it more than once.
The illustrations in this book will make you laugh out loud.. but the content will too!! This was a pretty quick read but one I will read again and again. I'd recommend it to anyone.. especially if you're taking life a bit too seriously!
Thank you for sharing your humor and artistic genius with the world.  And most importantly, thanks for keeping it real. You have my respect as well as my appreciation, and that isn't something I give out willy nilly.<br/><br/>Carry on!
Allie Brosh's original take on a graphical view of the world. Her stories are offbeat and enhanced by her unique artwork. At first you think the drawings are too simple, but very soon you see they substantially add to the story. Love it!
It is hilarious! I've loved Allie's comics online for a long time and was so happy to see her book finally come out. The humor and honesty she uses in her storytelling combined with her hilarious drawings make for a very enjoyable read.
THIS IS THE BEST BOOK EVER. Read it in a little under 2 hours, lots of pictures. Most humorous book i've ever read. I would seriously suggest this to you if you want a good laugh and want to relate a lot to some obscure things she says.
This book causes death by comicality.  I could not control my laughter or my binge-reading.  Allie Brosh is me.  Her dogs are my dogs.  And her twisted, innermost thoughts are all of our thoughts too.  Definitely a blog-to-book success!
Allie Brosh brings a fresh and humorous look at the struggles we have with being human. Her ability to express these difficulties allows us to drop our defenses, identify with humanity, all the while having a good laugh. Good medicine.
Wonderful book!  It's a book about real life put in a very clear and funny way. I find I can relate to the stories and to the author. Perhaps a bit too cynical in some places. But overall, an easy read, and an enjoyable experience.
I bought this book as a Christmas gift for my fiance. I always catch him laughing every time he reads it. I've read a few of Allie Brosh's blogs. She is hilarious. I can't wait till my fiance is done with the book so I can read it.
If you like the Hyperbole and a Half website, you will love the book.  Some of the favorite stories from the website are in the book, but there's plenty of new material to make buying the book worth it.  Also?  Beware of geese!  =D
Absolutely hilarious. Allie Brosh's drawings and existential humor can brighten anyone's day.<br/><br/>The new content is awesome, I especially loved her tips for dogs.<br/><br/>Will be buying copies for friends this Christmas.
Amazing book. So hilarious and funny to read. Allie is being extremely honest to herself and the readers, of course. I can relate with Allie sometimes, especially the chapter on her being depressed. This is a brutally honest book.
thanks daughter got this as a gift. after reading her blog of 'moving with the dogs' and laughing so hard with tears rolling down my cheek, i had to get this. she has a way with words and descriptions that makes me laugh out loud.
A great perspective for those who suffer from depression and don't have a great support system. Allie breaks it down, and the illustrations had me giggling out loud. And also her dogs. Hysterical. Honest. Light. A wonderful read!
I seriously LOVE Allie Brosh. This is the funniest book I've read in a while. I've recommended it to so many and purchased it for so many. It's fun to share with my favorite people. Because I KNOW they are laughing. Thanks Allie!
My favorite combination.  Completely disarming storytelling.  It may seem simplistic at first to the uninitiated, but (as is so often the case) beneath the simple exterior is a vast delightful and heartbreaking cavern to explore.
Allie Brosh and her warped, endearing illustrations always make me laugh and think. Her insight is captured in a sort of stop-motion humor that allows me to reflect on deeper meaning even while I'm rolling on the floor, laughing.
Allie Brosh's blog has always been amazing, her humour has had me in tears many times - and this book is no exception. Some of the best bits from the blog, interspersed with some new entries, make me so happy with this book!
I fell in love with Allie's blog a few years ago and as soon as I found out that her book was available I didn't hesitate to buy! I have laughed until I cried multiple times! I look forward to more writings from this author!
This book literally made me laugh out loud several times as I read it...by myself!  The author uses down-to-earth humor and real experiences...one of the funniest books I've ever read!  But it also has some good messages...
This funny anecdote-full book make us laugh and reflect on our way to be, on  our past and how react to every day to day things. This book is really worth reading. I think that you will have so much fun reading it as I did.
Some of my favorite posts from the blog didn't make it in here, and some of the new pieces aren't as funny as what is on the blog, but it is great just to have a physical book that Allie wrote. It is definitely an original.
Got this for my daughter for Christmas. I wasn't aware of the "f" bombs in the text, but she's 16 and hears it at school all day, she can handle it. I have only read parts, but it is truly side splitting throughout.
Like you need another review to know how amazeballs your book is. I'm weirded out by the peeps who wanted all new material. I wanted more blog material so I could hug it and squish it and love it in person. I like it, alot.
Ive been following her blog for many years, and preordered this book the moment I could!<br/><br/>It is beautifully printed on thick glossy paper, and a wonderful selection of all her best posts - including some new ones!
A great book for long plane rides.  The eclectic mix of anecdotal stories are fun to read -- and they make time fly by.  The author makes procrastination look like a finely cultivated -- and honorable -- personality trait!
A quirky book examining the inner workings of Brosh's mind.  I could identify with some of the essays but others were not really part of my world.  Overall interesting and a quick read.  The cartoon drawings were well, . .
I loved the book as much as I love the blog. I can't wait for Allie Brosh to publish her next book. My only issue was that the binding completely fell apart. I may buy a 2nd copy just to have a more intact copy for myself.
Allie Brosh is a mad genius.<br/><br/>There's a lot of good new stuff here that isn't in her blog. There's a lot more great stuff on her blog that isn't in here though, which I'm hoping means that a sequel is on its way!
This book is full of whimsy, and hilarity. It is a collection of stories from her life, and most of them are new and different from the blog posts. It is a quick, easy, relaxing, and funny read. I definitely recommend it!
Even if you've never read the blog it comes from, you will be hooked after reading this.  My daughter has it as an assignment for "summer reading" and couldn't put it down, finishing it before school even let out.
i follow Allie's blog so this was a given to buy the book...all the fun stories from her blog and more awesome revelations in a bright big book. for amazing life insights and hilarity on top,,i recommend this book highly.
Witty, endearing, smart, and hilarious... I laughed out loud many times while reading this.  Its a touching, sensitive, hilarious book and I think you should read it, then buy it for your family members who need to smile.
I love Allie's blog, and pre-ordered this book as soon as I knew about it. If you want to read interesting, funny stories about a person's own misadventures, with awesome doodles to round it out, this is a book you need.
This is a fantastic little book.  It is a super quick read, and I was a little disappointed that I had already read many of the stories on her blog, but there are some new ones in there also, and they didn't disappoint!
As someone with a fair amount of anxiety, I feel like everything in here is speaking right to me.  She had me from the first page...I literally had to stop reading it because I was laughing so hard I kept my wife awake.
Funny, poignant, and true (even if it's lies). The author clearly knows what depression feels like and it's a good lesson for anyone. Also, she is very, very funny telling about her childhood and life. It's a nifty mix.
Allie is hilarious! So much of her experiences I can relate too. I read this book twice when I got it and all my friends asked to borrow it. Will really have you in stitches. I can't wait til her second book comes out!
This book was a nice read that you can knock out quickly. It seems about every other story is something that is not available on her website. I really enjoyed it and it's already made the rounds in my group of friends.
My husband commented several times that he loved hearing me laugh out loud as I read this very witty, smart book. I love the way Allie tells a story in both words and art. This was a very fun, quick, funny, smart read.
Good book with good new material. Very quick read. Doesn't include all of her previous material. Allie's style of storytelling really speaks to me and reminds me that we all have our struggles that we need to overcome.
I've been reading Allie's blog so most of the material wasn't new to me. She really is so funny and the drawings are hysterical. I really love her outlook on life and can relate to so many of the stories.  Great book.
Allie never fails in making me laugh until I cry. Her honesty and bravery coupled with her sense of humor is utterly delightful even when writing about her inner demons. Truly an amazing read, I could not put it down!
The simple dog had me laughing. The depression had me, completely, better than any other experience of depression I've found, relating. Just the numbness and blahness and subsequent self loathing...in my opinion, pro
Or if you didn't know she even had one, I would definitely suggest grabbing a copy of this book. Brosh's wit is like no other and her story-telling ability is not something I've ever seen before. Definitely worth it.
This has much the same material as her blog but I really wanted to support her and purchase this.  Her speaking out about her depression has helped many and her dark/silly sense of humor makes the purchase worth it.
Even though I've read all her posts on the blog, they still had me laughing as I reread them in book form.  Plus it was full of new gems not found on the site.  This book is great for anyone that needs a good laugh.
This is the best thing since sliced bread! Laughed so hard while reading this and enjoyed all of the drawings and pictures,  immensely. A++++++ It was so good that I bought a hard copy also and gave as a gift.
Entertaining, it helps if you are as nutty as the author but ok if you 're not too normal and have your own inner thoughts that you thought only you had. Also good if you ever owned a completely worthless dog.
i think everyone should own this book.  so funny, smart, witty, sad, and great!  allie's dogs remind me of my own too, those parts of the book remind me of the hilarity in my pwn life i often take for granted.
I really enjoyed this book, the quirky artwork helps bring the messages in the book home!  The book made me laugh, cry, and think.  The chapters on her depression eerily echoed my own depression. A great read.
This book is everything you would expect from Allie at Hyperbole and a Half, and totally worth spending the money on. I rarely buy books new but this one was worth it. Hopefully this is just the first of many!
I love love love love this webcomic, and the book is just more awesome. If you find her writing honest and relatable, and let's not lie, everyone does, this is something you need to have with you at all times.
This woman is amazing and I'll be surprised if you can't relate to her absurdity, honesty, and humanity.<br/><br/>(Doesn't include all the blog posts by any means, but includes new stuff and it's super fun.)
Laughing out loud.  LOVED the illustrations.  This would be a good book for anyone who has gone through tough times (haven't we all?).  Allie Brosh hits the nail on the head about life events over and over...
This is easily one of my favorite books ever. The book is split into color coded chapters, with each chapter being better than the last. I just love the art direction. It's all so simple, but full of emotion.
I love this book and the blog.  The author is really an inspiration.  I literally laughed so hard I cried reading about the simple dog and helper dog.  Thank you Ms. Brosch for being so creative and awesome.
The simple drawings and honest prose brings you right into to Allie's life and the realities of our own.  So funny, so true.  I think Brosh can make Hyperbole as successful a series as Kinney's Wimpy Kid.
This book was a gift for my daughter and she loved it!! If you have read her blog and comics then this is a must have read for you. The book was a good value being on the longer side for pleasure reading.
I've been a huge fan of Allie's blog for many years. The book is terrific. Some of the older classics, and new "stories" as well. It is a fun, thoughtful, and entertaining book. I like it alot ;)
Good book. Very funny. I'm pretty sure everyone who has ever had a dog has had "simple dog". The two chapters on depression have to be among the most poignant I've read anywhere. Worthwhile read.
Buy this book.<br/><br/>By it for Parp. Buy it for Menace. Buy it for depression. And buy it for the dogs... Oh the dogs, it will make tears from laughing so hard.<br/><br/>Giggles will be upon you.
I enjoyed this, but didn't think it was as great as many people have purported it to be. There were a few spots that I laughed out loud, but most of the time, I just couldn't completely relate to Brosh.
The self reflection (identity part 1 and 2) was so-so. Sometimes they were funny, other times it felt just a bit redundant. The illustrations were well done and helped bring more humor into her writing.
This is a wonderful book. Very funny! It also has some wisdom to impart concerning the author's trip through depression. It shares her story in a charming, insightful way.  It's definitely worth a read!
Fantastically funny, honest, and entertaining. I think this is a good guest room book for my house as it's an easy pick up and put down book (as long as my guests don't mind liberal use of the F word).
The honesty and authentic storytelling makes this one of my favorite books by far. Though the formatting of some strips has changed along with some illustrations, it still translates well to book form.
Amazon recommend this book and the cover art looks sooo dumb but I read the description and comments.  The comments were all very very good; I found this book extremely enjoyable and so did my sister.
I gave this book to four different people for Christmas this year. Universal adoration for Ms. Brosh. Everyone, everywhere should have a copy of this book and extras on hand to give all their friends.
This is one of my favorite "books (blogs) of the year! It's amazing how much such little illustration conveys. Allie Brosh is a genius for her art and her quirky stories that we can all relate to.
I enjoyed this book and had a few laughs. There were several laugh out loud stories and the pictures made me giggle. I wouldn’t say it was pee your pants funny. It was a fun read, something different.
I LOVE this book (as well as the website) and have bought it for myself and as a gift. Hilarious, and has a lot of content from the website as well as some new stories (love the one about the Goose).
Book was really funny. I'm sure the people around me didn't appreciate me cracking up on the plane, but I couldn't help it. I did not expect it to be a comic book, even though I probably should have.
she made me laugh and cry.  i adore her writing and her art is great.  i got my book club to read it last month.  some liked it others did not.  you have to "get her" and some of them did not
Laughed out loud. Deceptively deep, funny, inspiring book. The dogs rang truthful. I so enjoyed this delightful book. Her drawings are actually really good art with great compositions. Loved it all.
Love these cartoons a lot, they do a great job of explaining the unexplainable...crippling depression. Hopefully it helps cheer people up or make people understand what a loved one is going through.
I can't even approach how good I think this book is. Somehow in writing about herself and her outrageous life experiences, she manages to articulate the absurdity, heartbreak and joy of being human.
I'm a fan of the blog and definitely glad that I finally read this book. It is a quick read and the stories are hilarious. My favorite was probably The Simple Dog, since I have my own simple dog!
I laughed so hard out loud on so many occasions, and all the rest of the time I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of this book. I read it twice in short succession, and gifted it to three people.
If you grew up feeling like an alien inserted into a population of humans, you will love this book and at the same time feel vaguely uncomfortable. That discomfort is self-recognition and memory.
I've been reading Allie's blog for a few years now, and eagerly awaited the release of this book! She's insightful, creative, and HILARIOUS! Buy it, read it, love it! I can't recommend it enough!
I've followed Allie's blog for several years and preordered her book. I'm so impressed with her humor, narrative ability, and sheer raw honesty as she shares very personal and hilarious stories.
I only finished the book in 2 days because I wanted to save some to read the next ... The chapter about them getting lost in the woods is super funny.<br/><br/>P.S.: My dog is also very simple
If you like your humor dark, and/or you love absurdist comedy, this might just be the book for you.  Also if you are a dog owner, this book is likely to be a winner for you.  A pretty good read.
This book is completely amazing. It has made me laugh outloud so many times and it is just so true to life. If you like dry humor and can laugh at lifes oddities, you will likely love this book.
Dear Allie,<br/><br/>You may say you are a sh***y person, but even if you are I like you anyway. Thank you for helping me laugh, especially at myself. Your book is my floorn.
I think the best review I can give this book is what happened when I read it: my boyfriend kicked me out of bed. You see, he was trying to sleep but couldn't because I was laugh/crying so hard.
I loved the author of this book since her original blog. She really knows how to write something that can make you laugh and I love that theres lots of pictures too.<br/><br/>Thanks Ally!
Allie Brosh is so funny and just completely describes the awkward outlook on life that I think so many of us share with her so well. I literally cried from laughing while reading this book.
Has some of her original blog posts but also new material - some of it's hilarious and other bits are more thoughtful. If you choose to read only one chapter, it should be "Parrot."
Hours of laughter from reading this. Or you know, however many hours or minutes it takes you to actually read through the book. If she releases anymore books I'll be sure to buy those too.
Very interesting, entertaining, and emotion full, definitely something to read in your life time! It was very relatable and when not it gave you something to add to memory, just wonderful!
YES YES YES do yourself or your loved ones a favor and BUY THIS BOOK. And read it in places where you can laugh loudly til tears run down your face, because you will and this will happen.
Allie Brosh has truly treated her fans to a magnificent piece of entertainment the likes of what we had come to expect.  I'm sure I can speak for the internet when I call this perfection.
My daughter gifted this to me... She's college age, I'm early 50's... And I laughed my --- off! It's very silly, and was a bonding experience for the two of us, anyway... (Giggle giggle)
Not many things are funnier than Allie Brosh - and this book is a masterpiece of hilarity.  It's relateable, it's endearing, it's absolutely hilarious.<br/><br/>Buy it, you'll love it.
This book is full of stories that will make you laugh and want to show people. It also has stories that are more serious and hit home. All around one of the best purchases you can make.
LOVE this lady's work. The drawings are perfect! She is fall on the floor laffing funny. We love her description of the 'Simple Dog'. And dog logic is soooo true. Thank you, Allie B.
The book itself was well up to my expectations and more. Sadly one of the copies had black printer marks on the front and as it was for a gift had no time to organise a replacements.
A painfully hilarious narration of a perfectly average life, as seen through the eyes of one the most creative writers of our time. It's a fun read that will leave you in stitches.
Wow! Is all I can say. Okay, I can say more. What nerve this young lady has to put it all out there and with such great funky fun illustrations to make it all come alive. I bought three more and am giving them to my friends.Loved it!
13 year old daughter won't put it down, reads it before bed like its her bible. She is an anxious kid and I believe she identifies with Allie and her many situations. Thanks Allie!
Get out of my brain! U have written everything I think but you are much funnier. Hysterically funny but I also totally relate 2 that lonely piece of corn lying on the kitchen floor
... and I'm glad I picked this one! This book had be laughing continuously. SO GOOD. I could personally relate to a few of these stories... not sure if that's a good thing. Teehee!
Love Allie Brosh.  This book cracks me up...I can flip to any story and read/re-read it.  I love her sense of humor and her dogs.  It may not be for everyone, but it's def for me.
Loved her blog, love this book, her drawings so simple yet so sensitive.  You will laugh till you cry, then you will make all your friends read it.  Cake! (I have never recovered)
Well written and entertaining. Makes you reflect in many cases into ones own real life situations. Spells out things you think, but pretend you are not thinking. Though humourous and comic book styled, makes you introspect.
Fun to read, unfortunately not for kids due to sporadic (and as far as I'm concerned, unnecessary) foul language. The identity chapters, I wonder how many of us can relate. :)
This book was just what i expected. Just the laugh i was looking for, totally relatable, funny... an easy, refreshing lecture.<br/><br/>Also very good quality in the images.
My oldest niece has a wicked sense of humor and this book was a perfect pick for her. She absolutely loved it and I found her reading before we even finished opening presents!
Bought this book after reading her blog, wonderful book, my daughter was pictured in multiple Christmas pictures reading it!  Very funny lady and the drawings match perfectly.
This is a fabulous book.  If you know of Allie Broch's blog on the internets, get this book!  You'll be able to read new stories, and hold the pages in your grimy little paws.
This book was a fun, fast read that had me laughing so hard I shook thr bed and woke my husband up. Brosh's thoughts on depression were dead on and left me feeling not-alone.
This books is painfully funny. And the drawings are elegantly simple and effective.  I laughed out loud a number of times, because there are so many real-life truths in here.
Great take on dealing with depression, and describing it for those who don't suffer from it. Brilliant writing - love Ms. Brosh's illustrations! You can laugh while you cry.
I love Allie and check her blog regularly for updates. This book contains some that I've read and some new (also hilarious) stories...I just wish she would write more often!
While this book does contain a few stories also found on her blog, there are new stories included as well. The writing and drawings are great as always. Recommended reading.
This girl is hilarious
I enjoyed the book for the most part. The down-side: I had dutifully kept up on her blog, which made the book a bit of a disappointment. There was very little new material introduced in this book. A majority of the stories can easily be found on her blog. I understand the need to keep your blog updated while working on a book, but the 2 should have remained separate.<br/><br/>Over all the book and her writing style in general are hilarious and painfully sincere. She is one of the few bloggers out there that has actually brought me to tears and fits of laughter in the same post. She wields her digital pen and like a magician holding a wand and for that I am still very pleased about the book.
I followed her blog for a while and decided to treat myself to the book. Beginning to end it was as great as I anticipated. The content that is not on her blog is fabulous!
A nice light read about heavy issues. Well worth the money spent - the drawings were humorous and complemented what the writer was trying to get across. A really good read.
Allie Brosh is a genius! I love her writing style and have enjoyed her blog as well. And she is right on point - some of us will find a little of themselves reflected here.
A delightful book , great graduation gift add-on for an English teacher or education major.  Whimsical look at life using hyperbole.  Truly makes the reader laugh out loud!
Fun book.  Absolutely engaging and made me feel like someone understood the lows of looking for the corn under the fridge to a misplaced hot pepper fetish.  Kooky and fun!
I bought this book for my wife, but ended up reading it myself. Very funny and an easy enjoyable read, and I don't even like books. Especially good if you have a dumb dog.
I love Allie Brosh and Hyperbole and a Half and was very excited when this came out.  There were parts that made me literally laugh out loud.  I'd definitely recommend it!
It's a hilarious book and I read it all in one sitting because it's so funny. The only thing I wish is that it was all new stuff instead of a couple repeats from the blog.
Otherwise I wouldn't know where to go to read new parts.<br/><br/>(No, it's a perfect book and I'm so happy and I'm sitting here giggling like an idiot while I read it.)
Allie brosh shares her life experiences with stories and illustrations that are  outrageously funny.  She is so incredibly talented. I can't wait to see more of her work.
Absolutely off-the-wall hilarious from someone who obviously gets it.  She's got a fear or a frustration for everyone.<br/>And why does this review require a word count?
Hilarious and surprisingly moving and meaningful. I do wish that there was less recycled content from the blog, though. I've read the fish story like eight times already!
Nothing about figure skating in this but this book is funny as hell.  The other 5 star reviews are prob better written than this, so if you don't believe me... read them!
great book. Allie is brilliant and funny and if you've ever gone through depression or anything related to it this book will help a lot.<br/><br/>will always recommend.
This is supposed to go with me when I return to Europe. The family I'm visiting in the States have loved it and are reading as fast as they can before I take it with me.
I hadn't known about Allie Brosh before buying myself her book for Christmas.  So hilarious, touching, stupendous, really!<br/>The dog parts are so flipping funny also.
I LOVE THIS BOOK!<br/>So funny, heartbreaking, smart...<br/>The illustrations and stories are funny and good and I could relate to the author very much.<br/>Love it!!
I love this book and recommend it to just about anyone I know. It is a quick and easy read that enables the reader to relate to some of life's more complicated feelings.
If anyone knows the work of Allie Brosh, you will know to get this book.  If you DON'T know Allie or Hyperbole and a half...<br/><br/>...well then you are dead to me.
This is one of my fiancé favorite reads and we enjoy randomly picking a story and reading before dinner time. Great find, relatable stories and great coffee table book.
Allie Brosh is one of the most insightful bloggers. I really love reading her stuff, she makes everything she talks about so easy to relate to. I love her pictures too!
This was a really great read, I really love her humor and intelligence and her ability to depict depression in a way that made it a little bit easier for me to handle.
The book is funny. The pictures are funny. I waste my life away working on a computer. I like to look at a real book.  I read it in one day, it's mostly illustrations.
It's absolutely fabulous. I laughed so hard I cried. I highly recommend it to any Hyperbole & a Half fan, or anyone that loves to hear tales from other peoples' lives.
Funny and witty as everything I am used to reading on the Hyperbole and a Half website.  This is a great gift for anyone who has enjoyed Allie's musings and drawings!
Favorite! Will be a "classic" on my shelf forever.  Had no idea what to expect when I bumped into this book, ... was amazed and delighted all the way through.
Allie Brosh can do no wrong in my eyes.  I can read one of her stories for the hundredth time and still be as weeping and breathless with laughter as I was the first.
The stories in this book are so funny, you will fall off your seat laughing! The story about depression was the most relate-able I have ever read. All around awesome!
An amazingly funny, yet poignant book.  I found myself laughing one moment and being moved to tears the next.  Great quick read. I loved the illustrations.
Allie Brosh is pure genius. I bought this and was so hooked that I read it in one 5 hour road-trip despite having motion sickness. I could not put it down.
I can't believe how well Allie writes and animates. It boggles my brains. I laughed, cried, and died a little while reading this. Get it, read it, love it.
Such a funny, thought provoking and interesting book. It really makes you think about yourself and explore the inner workings of your mind while laughing!
Precise and insightful analysis of human vulnerabilities and hilarious descriptive style.
I loved this book so much that I read it back to back. It is absolutely hilarious. I even bought copies of the book for others to enjoy. Highly recommend.
Allie Brosh is HI-larious! This is a mix of some of her classic cartoons and some new ones. I laughed so hard I cried.  My advice is to BUY ALL THE BOOKS!
It was an amusing and interesting read. The section about depression was the most interesting to me, though the anecdotes were pretty good in my opinion.
Great book! I thoroughly enjoyed it and I hope a second addition is available soon. The price was awesome for the content. Item arrived by expected date.
This book is everything I ever wanted.<br/><br/>Your blog is literally the only blog I bother to follow.<br/><br/>Please never stop being you. <3
I love this book and the drawings! If you have/had depression you will especially like Depression part I & II. I hope Allie will write another book soon!
I loved this book. I've been follow her blog, and I hope it helps Allie as much as it's been helping other people, as well as me! It's better than CAKE!
Some giggles here, and some really relatable anecdotes, but in the end it was a little whiney and wallowy - and I get enough of that inside my own head.
If you like her blog you will like her book! It was hard to put down and so funny that I may have actually laughed out loud waking y sleeping boyfriend.
I purchased this book after reading Allie Brosh's on-line ramblings, and the humor and absurdity continue as expected.  I also gave this book as a gift.
Fast shipping. This book is simply amazing. I was an avid reader of the blog and needed to own the book. Allie Brosh deserves your money. BUY THIS BOOK.
See above. I love Allie Brosh and have followed her blog from the beginning. I'm waiting for my brother in law to finish reading this so I can steal it.
Crazy, this writer hits the funny bone and then your funny head in a way no other does. An intimate look at the inner workings of a very strange person.
This book may be too close to reality for some of us.  However the wonderful drawings help to put a face with Allie's (and my own) suffering.  AKA LIFE.
I couldn't read this book in public in fear that I would pee my pants in front of others. I absolutely love the way she writes about her dogs the most.
Absolutely worth the money. My teens love it. My patients love it. I love it. She is smart and funny and has a wonderful grasp of the human condition.
Love it.<br/><br/>I've bought this book twice now and given it away to other people because it's so good I can't keep it to myself. Buy it. Love it.
The pages are really pretty colours. Love the drawings!<br/>Equally funny when making jokes and tackling serious issues. Couldn't put this book down!
A great book! Heartbreaking and funny. I don't re-read many books but I've read this one 3 times. Incredible artwork. I'm a huge Allie Brosh fan now.
I'm not really a fan of comedy but I really enjoyed this book! The pictures that go along with it really allow you to see the author's point of view.
My niece read a borrowed copy and wanted her own. She pumped the air and said "YES" when she opened it. Quick shipping and excellent quality.
I have followed her blog for some time now and I recently bought her book and it didnt dissapoint.  It is a quick read and it will keep you laughing.
Cake, letters to one's future self, depression, dogs...No one makes me laugh through my nose in front of other people like Allie Brosh does.  Genius!
Hilarious yet poignant. Allie Brosh has a knack for describing her innermost thoughts so well that you feel like friends after you've read the book.
Enjoyed reading this. Will be telling others about it. I've been following Allie's blog for years now, there's no way I wouldn't have read her book.
This book includes some of the best stories from the blog and some really fantastic, laugh-out-loud new stories! They make great holiday gifts, too!
I stumbled on this book by accident and so glad I did. It is both funny and serious as the another discusses her struggles with depression frankly.
Absolutely hilarious. I read the whole thing in two days because I couldn't put it down and I laughed out loud many many times. Highly recommended!
I laughed out loud at the text and illustrations, and it treated some serious subjects in a way that brought understanding along with the laughter.
Hilarious!! If you need a good laugh (and who doesn't), I'd highly recommend this blog-style book, with extras that you can't find on Allie's blog.
I enjoyed this comical yet accurate view of living life & dealing with depression & related things. I also love dogs so that was just a huge bonus!
Alllie Brosh adds wit and illumination to those suffering from depression and loved ones who strive to better understand this illness. Bravo Allie!
Allie Brosh's insights on her life and life with her dogs. A longer paper version of her blog, nicely bound. Recommend for all who like to laugh...
Gives hope and a sense of being understood for people struggling with depression. A hard copy is better than eBook to enjoy the colorful pictures.
Well written and laugh out loud funny. Absolutely worth reading. Instead of getting bored and stopping I was sincerely bummed when the book ended.
Allie is a wonderful writer and this book was hilarious. I bought another copy for my friend because I don't want to lend this one out and ruin it
Hilarious and endearing! I love Allie's blog and the book is a great compilation including classic older material as well as some brand new stuff.
I've been following her for several years now and her genius never fails. You have to read her blog. That's where some of my favorite stories are.
I wish I had the guts to write this honestly and still be funny! Amazon wants me to write six more words for this review, but HA! I wrote sixteen!
I laughed until I cried!  The goose in the house chapter...as I was reading my husband kept asking, "Are you okay?"  I had to order copies for all the readers I love!
I laughed out loud alone in my room. This book is so hilariously witty, but it goes fast and leaves you wanting to check out her website for more.
The only book I've read so far that's made me laugh out loud. I was genuinely surprised by how funny this book is and I'm happy with my purchase.
I typically don't read books but the use of memes drew me to it and it was funny, some chapters I completely related. I definitely recommend this
Witty, cleverly illustrated, full of insights into real modern life and hilarious anecdotes.<br/><br/>Allie Brosh is a master at what she does.
I love Allie Brosh so much, and this book is AMAZIN (I've bought 4 copies! 1 for me, and 3 for friends!). So glad I can own her stories/drawings.
Love it as much as the site. Plus it is an easy way to convince people who don't like reading online to still appreciate Ally Brosh with fervor.
I've been following her for a while now, it's nice to be able to go through all the stories again and enjoy her animations... freakin hilarious.
I bought this item for a Christmas  present. The person I bought it for was delighted with it. I would recommend this item for mature audiences.
I found the comic online and introduced it to my wife, who loved it.  Once she found the book, I knew that she had to have it.<br/><br/>PARP!!
Immensely relatable and hysterically funny, partially due to the writing and partially due to the (purposely) horrible illustrations.  Loved it.
This book is funny and poignant. Also, it is very colorful, which was a lovely surprise. I laughed, I cried and all around enjoyed it very much!
Funniest book I've read in a long time. Fans of her blog and pretty much any other random stranger will love this book. VERY short read though.
She is very entertaining - Love her blog and her book! Bought several copies as gifts! I wish Amazon carried other merchandise from her though.
If you like the web comic at all, you'll love this book.  If you don't like the web comic there's no reason I would want to talk to you anyway.
Allie Brosh is a genius. Great book, would buy again (will buy again, as this book makes a great gift); would buy anything else she ever wrote.
I love this book so much and it was impossible for me to put down I thank Allie Brosh for having a life so interesting and sharing it
Love the blog. Love the book. I bought this for my boss. The Sneaky Hate Spiral post on Allie's site is what got me to purchase this.
I really enjoyed it and although I paced myself, still ended up finishing it in less than a week. Very humorous and good animations.
If you've ever felt depressed, you'll love how she tells her own story with humor and pictures in a way that's incredibly relatable.
I enjoyed it that much.... I know it is something I will come back to in the years to come!<br/><br/>can't wait for the next book!
I was surprised at how long this book was, much longer than I expected.  And I was surprised at the amount of new content.  I would have been perfectly happy to buy a book of all her old material, because I've gotten so much pleasure from it, but the new stories are just as good as, if not better than, the stuff she's put online.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough.  I may well simply buy a copy for everyone I know as their Christmas present.  It is a book that drives one to evangelize for it because you want everyone you know to experience the joy and hilarity and poignant understanding of the difficulties of being human.  The story about the goose had me roaring with laughter.  You need this book, I promise.
A goodselection of the original blog and some fantastic new content. Allie has a startlingly relatable way of looking at the world.
It's like the blog, but in your hands.  Well written and illustrated, good humor, even when broaching more serious subjects.  LOVE.
I follow Allie's blog and thoroughly enjoy her humor...now I have something on my coffee table for others to read... Thanks Allie..
I love Allie and I love this book.  That's all that you really need to say.  It's all the best stuff from her website in book form.
This book has it all. It has laughs, it has cries-although those are from laughing so hard you start to cry. I've been a fan of Allie Brosh's since ~2010, back when her blog posts included actual pictures, along with her cartoons. I remember when the "Dinosaur" was in her home. She has a way of making you feel like you're her friend. That you are both in this crazy thing called life together. Exploits with Simple Dog and Helper Dog make you feel the pain of having an animal that doesn't quite reach expectations-and you adore them no matter what. This book is a must read for anyone who likes to laugh, who likes dogs, and who can appreciate a woman whose journey is far more crazy and interesting than our own.
Many lols and many increased sense of awareness... The illustrations really extenuated the meaning. One two three four five six...
I was laughing out loud almost immediately, then crying like a baby, then laughing again. What a great ride. This book is a treat.
I  found out more about myself reading this book, than any psychology textbook!  Awesome to know I'm s***ty and trying to hide it!
So worth it.  A great read!  Allie Brosh is the greatest- so amazing at capturing life (the good and the bad) and making it funny.
This truly is a great book and a must read and buy!  Author is hilarious and pictures are interesting. Shipping was quick as well!
Stories of real life told with tongue in cheek. I laughed  I cried I enjoyed the honesty of her story. She couldn't make this up.
I waited so long to get this book and it was totally worth it! Allie Brosh is an amazing illustrator and story teller. Very real.
If you've read Allie Brosh's blog, this is a must have. It's all the best of her in one, wonderfully awkward and heartfelt place.
Hilarious at times, touching at others.  Fun book, both for my and my sister.  Interesting illustration style adds to the humor.
too short, too good, too close to the truth.  Enjoyed every line and every illustration.  More like stand up comedy, than novel.
Fantastic reading with brilliant pictures... I love how honest the author is, very funny! Would recommend to friends and family!
Every time I pick it up it makes me laugh so hard I cry. If you like Allie Brosh's blog, it's definitely worth having the book.
Laugh-out-loud funny! No, really, it is! Read aloud to my husband and daughter--they laughed, too! Must see pics to comprehend!
One of the funniest books I've ever read.  It's massively thick and gives you days and weeks of reading.  It's SO worth buying.
Not much to say . . . very, very funny. If you or someone you know is neurotic, you'll get a kick out of how the author writes.
Such a funny book. Brosh shed light on some of life's darkest aspects more profoundly than some of the most verbose literature.
This is a funny book, but it comes with some inappropriate language for minors. It's humorous though, gave me a couple chuckles
Allie Brosh is one of the greatest humans on Earth today. This was a masterpiece of comedy and real life I will always cherish.
I passed this on to all of my friends to read. Loved it! Her humor and artwork work together to make for a laugh out loud read!
Like the blog, it hits the spot.  I wish I could get my book back - loaned it out and it is going around my circle of friends!
I made the mistake of having this book sent to my work address. The secretary opening the mail enjoyed a chapter before passing it on to me. Be warned: it is not possible to read this book cover to cover, you may damage yourself trying! Fortunately, it is published in full color, so when the background color of the page changes, that is your visual cue to stop reading and go massage all the muscles you sprained while laughing. Also, don't leave the book lying around where others can see it. It will wander off, and may not come back very quickly. I highly recommend writing your name inside the cover as soon as you get the book. Also, a microchip for tracking my not be a bad idea.
I thought I was the only one who had these thoughts. Turns out this woman and I share a brain. This is our life story. Enjoy.
I couldn't stop laughing the entire time. It's like I was reading about my own childhood, drama and humor both. A great read.
3.5 really, good for a chuckle, but you can't read more than one story without needing to put it down. Funny but short lived.
This is an awesome book full of heartfelt stories, advice, coping mechanisms and disaster. I love it and HIGHLY recommend it.
Makes me feel much better bout my own issues.  I sincerely hope you will be doing more in the future!  Thanks for the laughs.
I want Allie Brosh to write a million more books because this is my all time favorite comical book as of now. JUST FANTASTIC.
400 pages in a really good price, printed with very rich colors. Also the book is extremely funny, I'd recommand it to anyone
This book is hilarious. I bought it as a gift, but once I had opened it, I had to hurriedly read all of it before gifting it.
I love you Allie Brosh. Everything about this book is amazing. It's so relatable on so many levels and split my sides open.
Amazingly funny. Especially the parts about simple dog. Best stuff in first half but still really good at end! Recommended.
This is the funniest book I've read in a long, long time. Allie Brosh's stories and illustrations are absolutely hilarious.
I love the blog, missed it while Allie was quiet and was THRILLED to get the book.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, classic Allie!
I just ordered my own copy here after reading my friend's copy. Unusual, different, great sense of humor, and a lot of fun,
One of the funniest and most enjoyable books I've ever read. I definitely saw myself in the sections about her crazy dogs.
In case you found yourself in one of her blog posts then this book will make you feel as if you found another good friend.
NO REGRETS, FOREVER.<br/><br/>And honestly that's all I have to say about that. But apparently I must meet a word count.
Allie Brosh is so funny and real. She really knows how to spin a good story and get you caught up in her awesome neuroses.
I have been following the Hyperbole and a Half blog for some time and decided to buy the book. It is definitely worth it!
Love her humor....I can't read this allowed sometimes because I'm laughing so hard I can't see!  She's a great humorist .
I purchased this as a gift for my husband. However I am unable to stop reading it myself and find myself laughing loudly.
Simply an amazing book.  Well "written" and easily relatable. I need more words to make this long enough to post.
Super funny book. It has additional entries beyond her blog. Recommend to anyone looking for a good laugh. Hope you enjoy
I laughed so hard, I cried and snorted!! This is a must have book for any library! I will buy it for a few other friends.
Hilarious book!
This book is hilarious. I laughed so hard at every chapter. It only took the day to read because I couldn't put it down.
I haven't laughed this hard out loud in a long time. My husband kept looking at me like I am crazy (shhh... I am crazy).
None of my friends or family have disapproved of this book. They all think it is hysterical and try to steal it from me.
The first few original pieces had me laughing so hard I couldn't breathe. It also has all my favorites from her website.
Allie Brosh is awesome, as usual. Her book has several of my favorite stories of hers. :) Definitely worth the purchase.
I knew the wait for Hyperbole and a Half in book form would be worth it. Love reading about the demonic child Allie was.
Love it! The blog is amazing and the book is amazing, Allie is amazing! You should buy it, and copy for your dog too. ;)
I'm exhausted on Xmas eve but this book was f@$%ing fun to read. Truly pulls no punches about all of our inner workings
My daughter loves it. So much of it reminds her of her. I read portions of the book on-line and knew she would like it.
Ever!!<br/>Especially if you have a simple dog and love Allie Brosh's blog.<br/>I gave one to everyone for Christmas.
Awesome funny real life stories.  I laughed so hard.  It was therapy for my soul.  With crass humor! Really great read.
Reminded me of my ridiculous moments of childhood.  Very full I was in tears reading the cake story.  Author is a cutie
Allie Brosh is a treasure.  Even if all she ever did was the tale of her two dogs, she would have a place in my heart.
This is a really fun book. She really makes all the nuttiness we can feel, doable. And funny!  It's non stop hilarity.
I read her blog, I live the book. Lots of repeated content, wish there had been more new stuff. Still enjoyed reading.
You'll need to wear Depends if you're of a certain age or have given birth. One of the funniest things I've ever read.
Very touching book. Will cheer anyone up feeling down. (for us on the outs of the world especially-we know who we are)
Its very hard for anything to make me laugh. Books,TV shows,movies, but I was cry laughing through half of this book.
Thought something as frivolous as this would just be a page flipper, but it's profound, hilarious and very very good!
LOVE LOVE LOVE this book !  you will laugh out loud !  turn to any page and enjoy !  also love the cartoon drawings !
Warning: loud bursts of laughter may occur.<br/>A refreshing dose of honesty that makes you miss it when you finish.
The stories collected here can make me laugh so hard even when I don't want to. Great stuff! Give her all the awards.
Hilarious! Got This for my friend for Christmas and he loved it. The drawings are wonderful as is the sense of humor.
all of it, but especially the parts about the simple dog and the helper dog.  These parts could be our autobiography.
i really freaking loved it really funny all the way i have read it more than 3 time already and its just really great
You will love this book!  Having a "helper" dog and a "simple" dog of my own, I could totally relate!
This book was a great read. I'm a big fan of Allie's web site and have already read and shared this book with others.
thank god this voice is out there. somebody has to be able to put in to song and picture what life is really like...
Absolutely love this book! I followed Allie's blog for a while and was ecstatic when I saw she was releasing a book.
Allie Brosh is hilarious and brilliant. Her comics have made me laugh harder than anything ever. Love love love her!
So glad I finally purchased this book. I love reading Allie's blog and I can't wait until she releases another book.
I've been waiting my whole life for affirmation that pie is so much better than cake.  Her findings are irrefutable.
Good book. Most of the stories are also available on her blog, which is mildly disappointing, but still a good read.
Very good book - Can't wait to see some more new stuff. Well done Ms Brosh, you have a unique way of telling stories
Always enjoy storied from this writer.  Wish her blog was still being updated.  Also wish this came in tradecloth.
Great way to explore the truth of most of us! I couldn't stop laughing and I've recommended this book to everyone!
Wonderful book.  It takes some time to get used to the art style.  The description of depression is very accurate.
I'm serious.  It is hysterical and honest.  I have never laughed so hard at poorly drawn imagery, well done Brosh.
Hilarious! I love the hyperbole and a half blog, so of course this book is my favorite! I laughed so hard I cried.
But all seriousness aside, read it a lot.<br/><br/>It's good for you and you will like it more than other books.
I highly recommend this for anyone that has suffered from depression or knows someone that has....it is a keeper!
This book had me laughing so hard I was crying. I have since bought several copies for friends. REALLY enjoyable.
I'm buying this book for all my friends. It's hysterical.<br/>I wanted to keep reading. So simple but so clever.
Allow Brody takes a.hard look at the running chatter in head and the stupid games we play when no one is looking.
If you've loved any single hyperbole and a half comic/story ever you will love this whole book. Five out of five.
Amusing stories, surprisingly funny drawings. Also, the paper used for the pages was really thick -- added value!
Simple Dog!  I followed Allies website and had to have her book.  Her sense of humor has me rolling on the floor!
I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas and began reading it myself before I wrapped it.  Very very funny!
Really funny and smart book, been a follower of the blog forever and waited anxiously for the book, she is great!
She is the funniest writer AND illustrator of all time as far as I'm concerned. The story about cake is the best.
ParP?<br/>Allie is the best ever. And her blog is the best ever. And this book? The best ever. You MUST read it!
Love the blog, love the book. Allie is hilarious and insightful and I hope she continues to find so much success.
Its rare for a book to make me laugh this much. Its a hard book to describe, but its absolutely worth your time.
Laughed out loud and then loaned it to a friend... still haven't gotten it back.  Will have to buy another copy.
I read this book every few months or so if I need an escape from stress or need to laugh. I highly recommend it.
I bought copies of this book for everyone I know! An Absolute Must Read! The quality of this humor is beautiful.
It made me laugh so hard, I had tears in my eyes. It's become a popular go-to gift for family and friends alike.
lovely book! 100% reccomended!<br/>she is so transparent and funny! just love it! now my kid is reading it also
This book was so exactly where we were on a work project, I had to buy it for my partner in crime.  Hysterical!
It's cool and humorous at first but it gets kind of old after awhile.  For the price I'd probably recommend it.
We all think like this and it's nice to have confirmation! I love this book and I want to have all the bananas.
Great images, great writing. I've liked Allie's blog for a long time and this is a great extension to her work.
I recognize myself so much in this book. It's hilarious but kind of sad at the same time. I love the drawings.
I'm not going to go in depth because I'm a lazy bastard, but it is an entertaining book.
I really enjoyed the author's style and humor.  Some of the entries are about dogs and others just about life.
I love her blog, and the book is similarly enjoyable. Several stories in here that I haven't seen on her blog.
Allie Brosh is a talented drawwriter and this book makes me smile every time I reread it- truly a work of art.
more fun than a basket full of kittens that are also ninja robots. also contains very helpful tips about bees.
Love her blog and knew I had to have the book. Super colorful pages were a plus. Made my side's hurt laughing!
I loved this book it was so funny but some improper words might not be good for some kids<br/>Good book thou
Excellent read. I love her blog. Can't go wrong with this buy. I pre ordered and am happy with that decision.
I LOVE THIS BOOK!!! Read Jenny Lawson's review on the back of the book...I challenge anyone to say it better!
this book is an excellent and easy read, had me laughing out loud! Ialso loved the drawings she did- fabulous
Less than halfway through this book I had tears streaming down my face. It's hilarious, fun, and a fast read.
Gift for college student , per her request... and she truly loves this book. Will purchase more for her too.
Allie can bring you tears of joy, and sadness at the same time. One of the funniest ladies on the interwebz.
Hilarious, made me laugh out loud. Currently trying to convince the rest of my friends to read it. Very fun.
Just got this yesterday and read it all.  Hilarious! Love the blog, love the book! Must read ALL THE THINGS!
This book is so wonderful and fun and insightful, I ordered 12 of them for friends for Christmas!  Love it!
This book is hilarious!! It is the perfect read for a long road trip to read out loud for everyone to hear.
Absolutely hilarious!!!  Can't even think about this book without giggling.  I can't wait for the next one.
Find your corn, people. No matter what you do, you'll always have that little bit of corn under the fridge.
She is hysterical in everything from her recounting of her dog's love of bees to her fight with depression.
This book always makes me laugh. Unfortunately I can relate to so much of it! The pictures are awesome too.
My mother was going through a rough time, and this book cheered her up immensely. Humor++, good light gift.
Been a big fan of Allie for a long time. LOVE her stuff, funny, well written & hilarious artwork & stories.
So funny. So accurate. I suffer from depression, and these comics give me a laugh when I get stuck to deep.
This book is great to read for a few minutes for a quick laugh, or read it for much longer for many laughs.
Very funny! A copy got passed around my office and I liked it enough to buy a copy. Definitely recommended.
Love this author love this book! "Why I will never be and adult" is a total explanation of my life!
Truly enjoyed this book. Allie Brosh has the comic goods to make you enjoy each and every page. Great work!
I laughed, I cried, I related so hard.. I love this book so much, I want to give one to all of my friends.
This is the most funny book I ever  read. I say it gits 5stars because it is so good . You should read it.
Very funny. And includes one of the best explanations ever of what it feels like to be severely depressed.
loved this book. excellent stories and anecdotes, and the funny as heck!! the graphics, too are hilarious!
The book had me giggling cover to cover I feel like this was writtenn about me I definitely suggest<br/>B
I never review books, but have to say this one is brilliantly funny.  Recommend it to all humans and dogs.
Do not read if you have s***ty parts of your ego YOU don't want to find out about. Awesome and insightful.
Clever, heartbreaking, and hilarious all at once, this book is something that I will read again and again.
If you have a dog, know someone with depression or deal with it yourself this book will have you laughing.
Love her comics!  Wish her blog still had active posts.  Was super happy to have a book with new content.
Love this book, shared it with my mom. I must be related to Allie, her experiences are eerily familiar 😃
Poignant. Also lots of reasons not to get a dog. Could be used as a manual to understand your depression.
Allie's blog is heartwarming and funny.  This book is the same.  I just want to hug her (and her dogs) =)
This is now my favorite book it is so funny and I want more books like this I wish the book never ended
Allie Brosh, one weird lady. An awesome funny goofy off the wall weirdo; and for that I love this book.
gift for grandaughter looked like great book. I don't know what you want me to say. I've said all I can
Check out her blog if you're unsure but this makes a great gift, coffee table book or bathroom reader.
Insightful, hilarious writing, delightfully dreadful illustrations, and stories you won't soon forget.
kol<br/>lokali<br/><br/>koka<br/>parti<br/>lopë<br/>ç'nkkkkkkkk :/ n b b b b b b b b b b b bëhet
If I could marry Allie Brosh, I would.  She takes what's in my damaged little soul and makes it funny.
A unique and charming look at Allie's adventures with childhood, adulthood, mental illness, and dogs.
A really awesome book for those who think of themselves as terrible humans because of their thoughts.
I'm addicted to the blog, but I bought the book for a friend's birthday, and she loved it! Thank you!
This book is hilarious!  It also made it to my house days before the anticipated arrival I was given.
For anyone that has ever owned a dog or felt even slightly inadequate at handling life - a must read
Best book of this genre. Lots of relatable stories and very funny outcomes. Writer is very talented!
Allie Brosh is super talented and her book is one you won't forget.  Touching, funny and thoughtful.
This book is a must have! The parts about her struggles in life really helped me and are hysterical!
Sometimes I laugh so hard I cry and sometimes I get to where I can cry because I can relate so much.
This book is pure genius and I can relate to Allie on many levels, it's both hilarious and poignant.
If you or anyone you know has every had depression, buy it just for the chapters that describe that.
hilarious as expected, was disappointing that 1/3 of it was already on her site. still worth the buy
I simply love her blog and was very excited to buy her first book.  It is hilarious.  Go, Allie, Go!
This book made me laugh so hard I woke up my husband. Now he's reading it and I can't get any sleep.
This is the funniest book I have ever read. VERY entertaining. I have only read one book in my life.
The Kindle edition of this book is extraordinarily badly made. Its pages display at a fixed size so the text is very small on the standard Kindle screen, it's clearly designed to be viewed in colour (despite being published in a format primarily intended for black-and-white readers) and for some reason you can't even mitigate these problems by reading it on a PC as the Kindle app won't let you download it.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend that anyone planning on buying this book get a physical copy rather than the Kindle version.
I laughed and laughed. I think because so much what she describes is similar to my inner monologue.
This book and author make me happy inside!  I read these stories online and now I can own the book!
A great book.  All the best of the interwebs and a few new things. Can't wait to see more from her.
Gaaaah! I love this author! I love her web comics, but wanted to support her by buying her book. :)
Maybe something was lost in translation on my kindle, I don't know...but this didn't make me laugh out loud much at all. I can see how it would work as a blog though, and will check that out.
I love Hyperbole and a Half! This book busted my gut a few times! I would definitely recommend it!
Such a great book and the illustrations (which are done in ms paint) are spot on. such a fun read!
An absolutely hysterical read. My go-to book when I've had a bad day and really need a good laugh.
This book had me laughing out loud! Loved it!  I will read I it again for sure :) read this book!!
I laughed until I cried. And then I just cried because what she says is so honest. Wonderful book.
This is such a funny book.  Great read and nice to pick up and go.  You'll laugh out loud at this.
Its a fairly short and enjoyable read. It had some dull parts but overall a funny relatable book.
Hilarious! Allie Brosch is brilliant. I only wish there were more pages! Keep it coming Allie....
Excellent. Plenty of new content not available on her blog and the old stuff is as funny as ever.
Super funny illustrated book. Hard to put down because I want to see what insanity comes up next.
I love the online comic and wanted a hard copy in case the power went out.  Books will never die.
if you like the hyperbole and a half blog you will like the book.  it is very cute and funny.  :)
Wonderful book! I've read it twice. So funny but also poignant and real. Highly recommended!
A hysterical book. Very easy read with lots of nice pictures. You will laugh your butt off.
I think Allie Brosh is a hard-working genius.  She tells it, and draws it, like we live it.
I love this book! She writes so well about going through depression and she makes it funny.
I liked this book. It was a good read. It was funny. I also purchased a copy for my sister.
Weirdly, I relate too well to these stories. I have bought this book for all of my besties.
i love this book so so much. i want to buy a copy for everyone i know. everyone. i. know.
My goodness! if you need a pick me up read this book! it is so hilarious!!! I love it!!!
BEST BOOK EVER. It's so funny that I didn't want to read too much and not have any left.
Loved this book. I bought it because I love Hyberbole and a Half, the blog, and so wanted to support her work. But this book is great on its own. I'll be buying a copy for stocking stuffers and gifts for friends - it's so well done and her stories are so funny, you can read them over and over and laugh just as hard as the first time. I especially love the stories about herself as a little girl. Great book, well worth the purchase. I hope she keeps writing.
Ah, sarcasm.  For some, like me, it is a second language.  Laughed and loved this book.
as funny as expected. The parrot story left me gasping for air I was laughing so hard.
Hilarious, heart-wrenching truths fill this illustrated stand-up comedy book. Read it.
I laughed until I cried.  It was worth the cost in the first chapter.  Try the sample.
Hilarious! I'm only mad at how quickly I finished it, but it warrants repeat readings
Such a funny book. I highly recommend! Especially if you have never been to her blog.
One of the best books I've ever read. Really funny but very insightful and relatable.
I laughed, I laughed some more, and then I cried from laughing. This is a great book.
It was short but I liked it and it was a good book to me and its worth the 7 dollars
Every home should have a copy of this book, next to the dictionary. It is that good
Great, but a LOT more swearing than I was expecting. (including multiple F-bombs).
ridiculous goodness, i wish i could wake up to an allie brosh comic every morning.
Gotta love her. She speaks for many of "Us". With humor and understanding
I've never commented on anything before. This book is covered in genuineness, full of awesome, and reeks of Pulitzer (well, maybe reeks is a bit strong. HA! See what I did there?)<br/><br/>But seriously, obtain this book. Settle in with your dog/cat/spider/partner/alot/dinosaur/fish and enjoy life as seen through the Allie Brosh lens. You will come away changed. Literally. You will pee your pants and have to change.
This made me laugh, cry, and deeply think about being a human. Emotions are fun.
An absolutely terrific and hilarious read!! My go-to when i really need a laugh.
Allie Brosh is a comic genius. I wish there were more original comics; book 2???
Enjoyable.  Good section on depression and some other common human experiences.
Everybody else has already reviewed the bejeebus out of this. Just buy it. Now.
I laughed the entire time I was reading this book.  If you're at all familiar with the blog, even if all you know is CLEAN ALL THE THINGS, then you'll enjoy this book.  The old content was just as fun to read this time around and the new content was well worth the wait.  Allie Brosh is one of the best comedians around and her delightful take on her life, both childhood and present, is always a blast to read.
I loved her blog and it is great to get that same awesome humor in book form.
Great book!  Hilarious!  You need this in your life.  You must get it.  Now.
Not many books get me laughing to the point of tears. This is one such book.
Freaking Hilarous! My neighbors must think I'm nuts from laughing to myself!
This contains the best description of depression that I have seen anywhere!
You know it's going to be a great book when you laugh out loud by page two.
Then it just got depressing and more depressing.  If you're cynical you may like it.  If you look for inspiration in your entertainment, find another book.
Hillarious and insightful - there's just not enough of it! Sequel, sequel!
Hyperbole and a Half: Unfortunate Situations, Flawed Coping Mechanisms,...
Great read! Snarky humor and deep feeliings mixed in perfect proportions.
Got here promptly, and I had a good time laughing through this book.
Hilarious!! I don't usually laugh out loud, but I do with this book!
dont buy too many books in hard copy anymore, but this was worth it!
I love Allie's blog, and having so much of it forever immortalized in physical hardcopy is just amazing. I recommend this to everyone, whoever you are, there should be something in here that you can relate to and giggle like a maniac over.
Brosh’s ‘Hyperbole and a Half: Unfortunate Situations, Flawed Coping Mechanisms, Mayhem, and Other Things That Happened’, (Touchstone, October 29, 2013) Gained notoriety and internet sensation via her blog upon where her anecdotal humor reached millions.  Upon first glance, she appears ridiculous as she recalls experiences she has with her very peculiar dogs and circumstances.  With closer inspection, her insight, strength; fortitude, and articulate genius shines forth.  From the simplest of life’s curious happenings, the nearly unreal circumstances we find ourselves in along with the hilariously funny takes on the most mundane of circumstances, Brosh was quick to deliver her neurotic and insightful perspective.  Incorporating her trademark MS Paint comics, Brosh’s enchanting and laugh-out-loud observations of her life mirror what we have all felt at one point or another.  Ruthlessly honest, relative to her struggles with depression will leave you with dagger-through-the-chest sympathy (along with the feeling of shadenfreud).<br/><br/>I hadn't read her blog before reading this book (although I have seen her comics in my FB newsfeed here and there) It certainly got my attention.
This book is laugh out loud funny.  The simple drawings add wonderful,  ridiculous understanding of the events being described in Allie Brosh's unique voice.  One of the most poignant descriptions of what it is like for a brilliant mind to be haunted by depression.  She still manages to make the subject entertaining.
Save yourself some money and go check out the blog. The book is good, but a lot of it came out of the blog so why pay $$$ when you can get it for free.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that Brosh is HILARIOUS. She has a way with words which I only wish I had. And I adore the pictures-- they are so simple, yet they are so perfectly hilarious for each situation. You will laugh out loud. A lot. The depression bit had me in tears which made me feel badly because I was laughing hysterically at someone contemplating their lack of self-worth. But that's the genius of Brosh. She can even make depression absolutely funny. She can make dogs funny. She can make a piece of corn funny. She can make anything funny.<br/><br/>You definitely should check her out, but try her blog out first. ;)
Her dog stories and illustrations make you laugh so hard that you cry.  Her use of humor to temper her explanation of what depression feels like gives unusual incite.  Entertaining and yet eye opening.
The text hits pretty close to home on many occasions and the pictures are hilarious. I'm pretty sure she has my dog ;)
The dog/pet stories were hilarious the rest not so much. When she stuck to the pet stories the book was laugh out loud
Really great, as you'd expect for Allie.<br/><br/>One star missing only because it *does* include a lot of content from her blog, so only about 2/3 of the book is new if you're a fan of hers.<br/><br/>But then again, it's all funny. I wish I could give it 4.8 stars.
Very good read; spot on - I should give it as Christmas Presents...<br/>Oh, they want seven more words -
The dog sections are amazingly funny.  The depression section not so much.  Either way good and easy read when you just want to laugh.
To start, I like this Alot!  There are others out there, but this is my favorite one...<br/><br/>The real question is WTF is wrong with me that I curled up in a ball laughing so hard?  There is a tortured soul of genius at work here, and if you an relate you should see your health care provider.  Fans of the blog will find some old favorites accompanied by new material mixed together in a blender and served straight up in a must buy.<br/><br/>Hope you enjoy it as much as I have!
Allies Brosh is amazingly good at describing how a chronically, severely depressed person's mind works against them. And somehow she makes it hilarious.
Anytime I am down or feeling confused about what I'm feeling period I almost always find the answers at the amazing Hyperbole and a Half blog. Allies stories have an amazing ability to both articulate what I am feeling in almost any situation, and there is something magical and holy about knowing there is someone out there who has not only felt what you have felt, but a lot of people, and better yet she is able to show it so beautifully. Thats what is so great about Hyperbole and A Half;  i can and have given people the blog and said "this is me. This is how i feel." That's the power of works like Allies, because she lets me know that I am not alone, that yes I am weird, but hey we're all a little weird sometimes, and then to turn around and share it with others who might not understand what is going on.<br/>This book has my personal favorite story, Why I'll Never Be An Adult, as well as the truest, clearest depiction of depression I have ever seen, and some new stories just for the book like the origins of the Helper Dog. I am so glad to give Allie money and to now be able to share these stories with others in book form.
I love this book. I love Allie Brosh. I may be lying to myself but know if Allie ever met me she would love me too and we'd talk all the time on Facebook and she would Like all my witty status updates.
Perhaps I'm biased. After all, I wouldn't be married if it wasn't for Allie (true story) and I've met many of my dearest friends because of our shared love of all things HAAH. Either way, I was so excited for this book that I read it in a couple of hours while loudly cackling to myself, and I pointed out so many passages to my mom that she pretty much read it, too. The dog chapters were my personal favorite because I have simple dogs and a Fun Police helper dog, but I don't think there was a single piece that I wasn't happy with. I don't mind that some of it was from the blog, because I love those stories to bits. My only regret is buying the kindle version. I wish I had a hard copy now that I know it's a rainbow.
First time i read Brosh, it's very insightful and the drawings are pretty cool. I wish she had more characters, even fiction would be great.
might be fun in printed form but loses a lot on e-book (drawings and writing).<br/>Some funny stuff but not the hype it got in the press
This book made laugh and cry. Amazing. Thank you for sharing Allie.
Great book! The pictures work well and she is hilarious and honest.
Check out her blog first if you're not convinced yet of her genius.
Fantastically fun. It provided hours of laugh for me and my family.
Best book ever! Ali is hilarious and writes very relatable stories.
Allie Brosh has always been a genius in my eyes. What a great read!
Hilarious quick read that will make you smile over and over again.
so funny, so refreshing, many age groups will find this a delight!
Have spent hour going over the stories and love every minute of it
This book is great, especially if you are starting something new!
Wonderful. I lie in bed and read this out loud to my girl friend.
Best book I've bought in a long time, definitely worth the money.
Allie is awesome and so are her stories, so I had to have this :)
Just as good at the blog. Some repeated content, some new stuff.
A book that I can read over and over again and laugh every time!
This is great book. I have already bought copies for my friends.
I recommend this to everyone. Everyone read book now. Is great.
Both my young adult daughters love this. Cult level twixt them.
Smart, sensitive, unremitting candor. Touching and quite funny.
You have to read this! Constant laughs. I couldn't put it down!
Wonderfully expressive and funny. Quick read (unfortunately?).
I laughed so hard!  This is easily one of my favorite books :)
Hilariously, painfully true. I loved it. Couldn't put it down.
Hilarious, fun read! No one can go wrong picking up this book.
This book is everything I hoped it would be and more. Allie never fails to make me laugh and she has this amazing way of making me see myself more clearly. Her drawings may not look like much at first glance, but their expressive faces are spot on. I love everything about this book, especially the rainbow pages!
Had me laughing my ass of multiple times. Highly reccomended.
Insanely funny. Had me laughing out loud while I was reading.
LOVE this book! Great product, great price, great experience!
THIS IS THE BEST BOOK. I bought 6 to give to all my friends.
Ok book but, in my opinion, more of a woman's look at things
Funny as all get-out. Dog lovers should read this book..
Great book, some dark humor but alot of laughs out loud.
I absolutely love this author and the book was awesome!
I love the writing and the illustrations.  Truly comic.
The funny's funny, but the depressing is a real downer.
Loved the humor and her ability to be blatantly honest.
I love this book.  I love Allie Brosh.  Love love love.
One of the funniest books I have read. Just fantastic!
Pretty hilarious & a good interpretation of depression
I love Allie Brosh for being honest, brave, and funny.
LOVE IT. GET IT. Laugh. (especially if you have dogs).
I really wanted to like this book but really did not. Too harsh, too negative, too cynical. It could have been redeeming and uplifting (without being syrupy; could have still had a funny, self-deprecating tone) but didn't measure up. Just felt snarky, yappy, defeated.
I got this for my friend for Christmas, she loves it.
The best. And the best depiction of depression, ever.
I laughed until I cried and then I laughed some more.
Allie Brosh, you crazy maniac. Stop being so awesome.
The quintessential manual for life! I love Allie's honest point of view as she slides, trudges and bursts through her cartoon life experiences.<br/>There is a special place for people like Allie who can describe anything! Even the sound of a vacuum!<br/>I love it!
If you are a fan of Allie Brosh's blog, help support her book.  Its just as enjoyable.  A mix of classics from her blog and new material make this a great book.
Hilarious! One of my friends' and I's favorite book!
Good read, funny but not over the top. Worth a read.
dog owner will have fun reading it but not only them
Fantastic. Such an amazing book I re-read it often.
A must read for anyone with anxiety and depression.
Just read it. We're all nuts. Now we know for sure.
Loved the writer's online work, also love the book.
This book is so SO funny! Made me laugh out loud!!!
Genius
Love Allie! wish she would come back to hyperbole!
Very entertaining and great potrtray of depression
So very happy with this purchase. Thank you Allie.
It will bring more than one smile to your face.
I found it hillarious. I was laughing out loud.
Snorting, crying, gasping.  It's all in there.
Hilarious!!!!!!  And the pictures are perfect!
Funny book. An author with a wild imagination.
I love it.  It definitely adds humor to life.
Oh my goodness!  She makes me laugh out loud!
She has made depression seem more tolerable with her silly little characters.  I got through it quite quickly.  Loved the insights about stupid things people say to people who are seriously depressed.  They're pathetic!
Best thing I've ever read in my entire life.
Buy This Book!!!!!<br/>Oh, and read it too.
I've read it a dozen times - still laughing!
Amazing and heart-rending - a must-read !!!
This book is hilarious. Absolutely love it!
Absolutely love this book! It is hilarious!
I discovered Allie's blog through a news article link to her Depression Part 2 post.  I then read backwards to her earliest post in the span of a couple of weeks, at most.  People love Allie for a lot of good reasons.  She's a gifted storyteller.  She's hilarious.  And I think most of all, she uses her voice and drawings to tell deeply personal stories that resonate with people universally.  It's like she's documenting human nature.  And people really identify with her.  It feels like we are connected through her storytelling; hence the feeling that all of us readers are her friends!  I asked my husband for the book for my birthday, one of the only hard copy books I've wanted in the years since I got my Kindle.  I wanted the images on the page, and I was pleasantly surprised that it's a nice, substantial weight in paperback, though I regret not asking for hardcover.  When I got it, I handled it almost reverently, savoring all of the stories.  At a stressed time in my life, I love unwinding with them at the end of a long day, whether it's through humor or identifying with her.  I still have the last one waiting for me.<br/><br/>As far as the stories included, I think it's great to include new ones as well as blog favorites.  Accessing them on a computer screen over the internet can feel different.  There are the universal human-nature stories, which she seems to think make her weird, and I think are speaking to something deeply ingrained in all of us.  I cannot get enough of her dogs.  And the goose story re-told with illustrations was so fun.  I might order the Kindle version too, just so I can take it everywhere (though unfortunately, I have the old 3g Kindle, but maybe the Kindle App on my iPod touch will look okay?).<br/><br/>I took off one star, and it pained me to do so, but it was necessary.  Allie refuses to use subjunctive tense.  I don't know why.  But Allie, I wish you would read this, because I really don't like it Alot when you incorrectly use present tense when you should use subjunctive.  It's my own particular Alot.  It really distracts me and takes me right out of the story, which makes me sad, especially because I've read it's important to Allie not to do that.  But I still love her.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Allie's not weird, people who don't love her are.
My first review was declined because I listed the titles of the chapter. So I am copying and pasting it in with an edit for people living in a cave who have never heard that word...If only Amazon spent half as much time refusing to publish fake reviews, troll reviews, and taking down harassing comments, troll comments, and fake products. That said, if you can't handle the A word, don't buy this book. You won't like the humor if swear words put you off.<br/><br/>I've been waiting a long time for this book to come out and I found it at Half Price Book on a 40% off coupon day, so ended up picking it up for around $8 while it was listed on Amazon at $13. Prices go up and down daily so who knows...<br/>If you are a fan of the blog, you will probably love this book and most of you already have it. I waited a week or two because I wasn't sure how many new stories it would have and how many stories it contained that I already liked versus ones that I didn't...<br/>Yes, there are a few stories already posted on the blog, about half of the book, but for me, it's worth it to have them in print form.<br/>Especially Depression Part I & II.<br/>For anyone not familiar with the series, I would suggest going over to the blog and reading a few of them to see if you like the style of humor.<br/>There are some I find hysterical and some that are a little bit of a miss because I find the situations or the little girl in them a little annoying.<br/>To summarize it, the little girl on the cover is the author as a child to present day. The stories are illustrated with comical pictures that tell the story. The style of humor is unique, self-depreciating, and above all- funny.<br/>Here is a listing of the stories for those who want to know exactly how many new ones there are...<br/>Warning Signs, The Simple Dog, Motivation, The God of Cake (one i didn't enjoy on the blog or in here), The Helper Dog Is An AAAAAAA (guess what this word is??), Depression I & II, Lost In the Woods, Dog's Don't Understand Basic Concepts Like Moving (fave), The Hot Sauce Debacle, This Is Why I'll Never Be An Adult, The Parrot, Dinosaur, Thoughts & Feelings, Dog's Guide To Understanding Basic Concepts, The Party, Identity I & II.<br/>The humor is NOT for small children as themes include depression and sarcasm.
Love the candid recounts of her childhood!
More of the awesomeness from Allie's blog!
Hilarious and insightful at the same time.
This book really is terrific.  The words are perfect, the pictures brilliantly simple, and it all comes together to tell the stories. Anyone can relate to the author and her adventures.  You won't be sorry.
Fabulous book! Couldn't put it down!!
This book was amazing. Thanks, Allie, for making me laugh about s**** things. I don't think I've ever read a better description of depression. All around funny and honest book.
Delivery on time, item as described.

This book made Bill Gates' summer reading list of 2015. Allie Brosh cleverly recalls stories from her life that will have cracking up Alot.
I finished this book in one sitting - and Allie, if you feel like writing any others, I'll buy those too. Just in case you were wondering!
Sweet book! Honest and fun :)
Love the blog, Love the book.

dark humor, enjoyed parts
My absolute favourite!!!
I'm not a book reviewer.
I am not the only one...
Amazing and entertaining
This book is hilarious!
JUST PLAIN EXCELLENT!!!
Allie Brosh is amazing!
It is very rarely, if not almost never, that a book so seemingly intelligent fails to wow me at the end.<br/>I believe that it is an authors' responsibility to create a world with their words.. One you can step into and lose yourself in. Reading a book should be a journey.<br/>However this read leaves you wondering what the overall intent of the book is. It feels as though the author has chosen to pick random instances out of her life and portray them in a nutshell to her readers with as many crude illustrations and cynical expressions as possible.<br/>I completed the book in a half hour but truly failed to understand how two events in the book connected to one another and whether there existed any underlying order to the chaos of short stories thrown at the reader.<br/>I wanted to like this book - the language seemed intelligent (minus the swear words of course).<br/>Left me confused and wanting more.
Funny book, enjoyed it
I laughed my head off.
Allie Brosh is my hero
This book is AWESOME!!
Love it! Great writer!
Funny and insightful.
Hilarious & relatable
Very funny book.  LOL
Hysterically perfect.
Funny!  I enjoyed it.
Perfect in every way.
I preordered this when I heard about the book back in May (2013). What struck me upon arrival was the sheer thickness. I was expecting something closer resembling a graphic novel not a Game of Thrones book! I opened the book and began reading the first passage which was a new one, I laughed until I just about cried. Then I jumped ahead to a familiar passage "This is why I'll never be an adult" and noticed that the "Clean ALL the THINGS" image was different, that's when it struck me. Not only are there entirely new passages but the old passages have entirely new art work.<br/>If you've not read Hyperbole and a Half on Allie's blog, but this book, never regret it.<br/>If you have read it, buy this book the new entries are worth it and it's fun to revisit the old stuff with new art. Either way solid buy.
Laugh out loud funny
Freaking hysterical.
Hysterically funny.
He may have been sober when he wrote this book but it is too existential for my taste, not used to the graphic language, did not realize that two year olds and upwards used the modern argot!<br/> Interesting mind set in most of the short chapters of a malfunctioning but briliant mind. Paints the picture with few words in every scene and that is admirable.<br/> A book that you should try before you buy or you may be disappointed.<br/><br/>Recommended for some, definitely not your maiden aunt, if she is over fifty!<br/> A hairy, bearded Dad and an airhead of a mum, easily manipulated by a devious infant,  fit the bill, minor sprigs of the 'tweed jacket, leather inserts at the elbows,for him' class, possibly, admirable.
A good light read.
Just a great book!
I died laughing...
Allie is awesome!
Wonderful writer!
I'd love a sequel
I cried laughing.
I love this book!
A wonderful book!
This woman is definitely "half a bubble off of plumb" but she knows it and lets us enjoy her personal brand of wackiness in an entertaining book about her trials and tribulations with her dogs and the world at large. Many illustrations but she has to be the worst artist I have seen presented in a book but somehow the expressions she is trying to portray manage to shine through. Second book by a woman of her generation I have read this year and like the first author, she also suffers from "potty mouth". Not sure what the appeal of that is to the younger folks but if you can get through that it is a funny and enjoyable read.
Interesting read
This is the BEST
such a fun book!
Allie amuses me.
Bloody brilliant
Very funny book.
Super duper uber
Love you, Allie!
Best book ever.
Hilarious book.
Best book ever!
I love Allie :D
Great book !
Hilarious!!!
I imagine she liked it
Very Funny!!
Too funny XD
I love Allie
I hate this book.  This is a terrible, awful book, possibly the worst book I've ever owned.  I bought it anticipating hours of pleasure and enjoyment, but boy, was I wrong!  Mainly, I've experienced intense, shocking pain as a result of Hyperbole and a Half.<br/><br/>When it fell on my foot it hurt like the devil.<br/><br/>Oh, the writing and drawings are hilarious.  I'm laughing through my tears.<br/><br/>But I think my foot is broken.
So I bought this the other day and it's still as funny as ever with brand new, hilarious stories, though in the few older stories she has posted on her blog-spot that are printed here, I found she lost a lot of 'character' when she redrew them to match her current style which made me sad because those facial expressions are what really made me chuckle. All in all, a very good investment if you ask me because it is well worth the read
While this book started off quite funny, light hearted and quirky, it devolved into a sort of black hole of dark, self-depricating, stream of conciousness about depression and not wanting to be a terrible person.  While the author had some funny insights about their own life, I think this book leaves the reader sorely dissatisfied.  I was hoping for a graphic novel but is seemed more like an illustrated monologue/diary entry.
Very funny!
hysterical!
Great read!
Love Allie.
good stuff.
Great book!
Fun, funny!
Love this!!
interesting
This book is one of the most hilarious things I've ever read.  Yeah, some of it is stuff from her past blog, but I've read it 8 times there, and EVERY TIME I about die laughing.  This book makes a GREAT way for me to share the hilarity of the web to those who say they "don't have time" to read stuff online or don't know how to "work a computer."  I am buying 3 more copies for friends and family for Christmas.
I loooooooooooooooove the blog this book is based on, but "The Alot is Better Than You at Everything" is pretty much my favorite thing on the Internet anywhere ever, and it's not in this book. So, sadly, even though everything that IS in this book is good, I can't give it five stars. That blog post NEEDS to go into a book! I need to give it to my elderly English teacher friends who don't get online.
I loved this book.  I couldn't put it down sand am waiting for the next one.  I suffer from severe depression and it is so nice how Allow Brosh explains exactly how it affects your life and psyche.
I know we all waited impatiently for this book to finally make its debut and it's here! I had to physically stop myself from reading the whole thing in one sitting. I loved it and also ordered the beautifully printed and bound full-color hardback edition. Allie's hilarious and witty stories and drawings always make my day. If you're undecided, check out her blog, Hyperbole and a Half, but you'll be hooked as well.
As always, I cried with laughter. Everyday things taken to hysterical heights. I'm so glad I bought this! Will read over an  over.
I loved this book & almost died reading it because I was laughing too hard to take in air. The hot sauce story is worth the price alone. If you love her blog, you'll love this book... period.
I laughed, I cried, I did both at once sometimes -- absolutely amazing.  Can't say enough good things about this book.  Worth every penny.
Just as good as I expected. Funny moments, hilarious drawings and an uncanny ability to tell a story.  The dogs make me giggle every time I read about them or see a drawing as I too have a "special" dog.
A must have for anyone who appreciates Allie, hyperboles, funny stories or life. The new stories are as good as the old and the illustrations hold their purpose in extending the humor. Stories are separated by color (paper).<br/>In short, it is a great book. I would recommend anyone who enjoys silly stories, puppies or cake to purchase this book to read and then reread.
Allie Brosh is a brilliantly honest, funny, self deprecating writer who is one of the few authors able to regularly make me laugh uncontrollably. This book collects some of her greatest posts from her blog interspersed with uniformly wonderful new material. If you like to laugh and are willing to occasionally go to some dark places along the way (along with bright, bizarre, dog-filled places), pick this up. You won't be disappointed.
If you are between the ages of 25 and infinity, this book is for you.  You will be able to relate to it and laugh.  Even if you can't relate at all, you'll still laugh.  Because it's funny.  So just get the book already.
Allie Brosh has a talent for making one laugh, even when describing her battles with depression. It's a risky thing to read this book in public because of the frequent urge to laugh out loud. I simply adore her stories about the simple dog and the helper dog. The simple dog has crept into my heart. The drawings are hilarious. My only complaint is that the Kenny Loggins story didn't make it into the book. That one is probably my favourite of all her blog posts. If you haven't already, get yourself over to her blog to read her other posts.
The only thing I did not absolutely love about this book is that it ended. There was "Alot" to love and I dearly hope for more soon. Allie, you make the world smile!
So simple, honest to a fault, and refreshing. It's neurotic and crazy and normal all at the same time. I can't pinpoint what I love about it. I just love it!
I'm a huge fan of the blog Hyperbole and a Half, and I think the book may have been funnier!
Allie Brosh is an amazing author and artist.  This book will keep you laughing read after read. Highly recommend  :-)
Many parts of this book and Allie's blog caused me to laugh out loud and made the cats move off my lap so I could make it to the bathroom in time to prevent a dire accident. Also vastly enjoyed seeing and hearing Allie read at Powell's on November 7th. Allie I think that you would probably kick butt doing stand up after watching you do Q&A.; Oh...and love the pain chart...even if it isn't in the book.
I wasn't sure how the blog would translate to book form, but it works.  The new material is wonderful, and I was stoked to re-read the older material while in the kitchen/bathroom/other non-computer places.  It's also nice to be able to loan it to the, um, older members of my family who do not read blogs, but really appreciate the art and writing.
as stated
so. good.
Excellent
Loved it!
Fun Book
Loved it
fun read
This is one of those books that just makes you laugh and feel sad at different times. Allie can make you understand and relate the things she endured as a child and adult, whether its depression, fear, anxiety or identities mishap to even loving a mentally special dog. Definitely a must read!
Ordered as a gift. The recipient has it on her Amazon wish-list & it is a blog we both read. I skimmed through it & look forward to reading it further. There was a lot of duplication from the blog however. What percentage I could not say as I didn't read the whole book.
Awesome
Average
I started to read this book but was a little put off.  I thought it would be humorous.  It is hard to find good, sharp, funny, humor, the kind I like.  One liners or good, funny stories, the kind Bob Hope, Jack Benny, George Burnes and Gracy Allen were giving us.
Brosh has done a good job balancing her book with old favorites and new stories.  She has done a great job translating the readability of her blog in to book form and keeps her self-deprecating wit throughout the whole layout, even to the 'about author' page.
Well worth buying. Best Coffee table book you will ever own! It stays funny no matter how many times you or your guests have read the stories. They are times less well written and something almost everyone can relate to in there own lives.
A light hearted book that rekindles childhood memories. It also explores the quirky behavior that we all possess as emotionally wanting humans. However, its not a book that I would highly recommend given the shallow depth of story line.
I have always enjoyed the author's blog and was looking forward to laughing my way through the book. However, chapter 1's running joke about her "retarded dog" was such a shocking disappointment. Don't waste your money on this.
Absolutely amazing book.  Does a great job of explaining potentially unexplainable situations.  It made me laugh, it made me cry, and it made me introspective.  I love the style the book is written in too. Miss Bosh, you are a genius.
I enjoyed this book immensely. So entertaining, and although I shouldn't admit it, I could identify with many of her experiences ;-) I wish there was a version without the foul language (be warned, there's a lot!!). Fun read!
I love the blog.  Love it.  There was no chance I wasn't preordering this thing the instant it became available.  And then I bought a house, and the book was shipped out to my OLD address, and I wasn't even bothered.  I just bought another copy.  THAT IS HOW AWESOME HER BLOG IS.<br/><br/>I was really happy to see that the book was also excellent.  It has my two most favorite entries - the one on cake, and the ones on depression.  (I've never seen someone so accurately describe depression.  IT IS EXACTLY LIKE THAT.)  The new entries are hilarious and reaffirm my decision that dogs are never going to be for me.  Ever.  The book itself is impressively thick - it's printed on really good quality glossy paper and has a nice heft to it, if you ever need to lob it at someone's head while you make your daring escape out the back window, giving you precious seconds to escape with your life.
I love Hyperbole and Half and Allie Brosh! This book is NICE. It's full color and high quality paper. It has a good weight to it but it isn't so thick that it's obnoxiously heavy (like The Walking Dead compendium is).
Some fun and a lot crazy!  Stuff about doggies, who I happen to fancy a lot.  I learned a few important points about depression which made me understand the condition much, much more than I ever did.  And that's it.
Allie is brilliant and unbelievably talented! Every story is entertaining and undeniably true. I've never seen a more accurate representation of depression and anxiety.<br/><br/>"Cake is all that matters!"
I bought this as a gift for a family member. He loves it.<br/>Me... well, I thought it was weird and meandering. (Yes, I skimmed through it.) Normally, I like this kind of humor, but the book was weird...
Absolutely, the funniest concepts ever.<br/>Bought for my teenage daughter, she loved it, so did I and now it's been lent out to friends. I hope the author continues, would be an awesome show. Good buy.
Nobody in my office will give this back to me.  We haven't put it down since it arrived!  It has a great mix of new and favorite stories.
I liked the part about the dogs.  Other stuff not that interesting<br/>Although getting lost was funny too<br/>Can't recommend
Got 3 copies, just in case I needed to find some friends to give them to. Hilarious read - with or without having read her blog.
This paperback book is heavy and great for weighing down do-it-yourself projects such as preserving leaves or pressing flowers.
he accully finished the book, which is rare for him<br/>he usually gets bored.  based on that i would<br/>recomend the book
I didn't realize how much of this book was taken directly from the blog- I think there were only a couple new stories.
Gave the book to my 19-year-old for Christmas and he read it and liked it. He's a sophomore in college, a film major.
I bought this book as a gift for my girlfriend and she really enjoyed it and found it hilarious and hard to put down.
Allie Brosh proves her comedic excellence again!  I totally snorted soda out of my nose by laughing while reading it.
It was cut on the cover and stained and other things. I was disappointed and I gave it to my friend after I read it.
I expected a lot more laughs  Maybe if it were in audio rather than print, delivery might make me like it better.
This book was as hilarious and poignant as her blog, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself with it. I love Allie Brosh!
Great writing, but more F bombs than I was expecting. I love her blog, so of course I loved her book as well.
What a treasure, Thank you Allie Brosh!! Truly a masterpiece.  (great price btw, lists for $18 on the back :)
Do not read this book if you have a headache; it really hurts to laugh that much when you have a headache. Do not read this book if you have a full bladder; it's really embarrassing to laugh that much when you have a full bladder. So take some aspirin,sit on the toilet,and definately read this book! I know what I'm getting everyone for Christmas this year,but I may have to include a few emergency supplies...
I have been a fan of Allie's for years and was looking forward to this book since it was announced. I was excited to see several new stories in the book that weren't on the blog, in addition to many of my old favorites. What I wasn't too excited to see was the curse/swear words in the stories that did not appear in the original blog postings.<br/><br/>The other fans of hyperbole and a half in my circle of acquaintance agree with me that adding this kind of language did nothing to add to comedic value to Allie's stories but instead simply narrowed her audience to people who are pleased by the mere presence of foul language. I'm going to be selling this book to someone who will enjoy it more than I will. It's a shame, because the story about the goose getting into the house was some of her best work and hasn't yet made an appearance on the blog.
A great addition to Allie Brosh's blog which I love! I'll be giving this book to all my smart friends.
everyone in the house wants to read it my daughter is bipolar she finished it in a day and loved it
I liked this book. It has me laughing out loud but I felt it was a little too comical than expected
Not to my taste.  I look to the reviews for insight but this time I wish I bought something else.
I didn't like it but the neighbor girl loves it so a 3 star.
not good would have made a better short essay.  Not a book.
Allie is a great story teller, this book is hilarious, you should buy it right now. I was reading it at my child's martial arts class and couldn't help laughing and crying in a rather disruptive fashion. That's no hyperbole this book is just that funny. I'm pretty sure the other parents think I'm insane now.<br/><br/>To Allie, I would write you an email but I wouldn't want to burden you like that, but I figured you are obsessively reading every review written by every idiot out there, so I write to you here. You are hilarious, and very brave. I had my friend read one of your blog posts, and wanted to punch her in the face because they weren't hysterical with laughter. But I didn't, you know, because I have fake dignity to protect and have to keep up the facade of niceness and all.  I don't understand why anyone who has seen your work would not want to crown you queen of the internet. You have a lot of self-awareness for someone so young, be proud! As far as I can tell, the only limitation you have is that you are too aware of your own B.S. to ever be a politician. Maybe you should put a warning on this book, what if people unaware of their own inner BS read this and are made aware? Yes you improve the world, but won't they be mad at you?<br/>I will say that it occurred to me that not many people would admit to the self awareness that you have, and I have contemplated that you are being held prisoner in a basement somewhere by an evil publisher being forced to write and draw for our entertainment. Having some issues with selfishness, I have been debating if I should mount a rescue or simply wait for more books and blog-posts. If you are indeed in need of rescue, place a random unicorn in your next blog-post. I have found a selfish reason for rescuing you, you can reward me by giving the Allie Brosh treatment to one of my humiliating childhood experiences.
Eh, it's just the blog put down onto paper.
We all thought this book was a stitch.
not really a "business" book
Fall off the couch laughing funny!
I thought it was going to be something light and funny. It end up to be a little too weird... I guess I didn't get the message.
Great condition great price.
I will preface this that I LOVE Allie Brosh's blog.  Hilarious, witty, and just oh-so funny.  So I was a little disappointed with the choice of material for the book.  There is more cussing than  a lot of her posts (I know this doesn't bother a lot of people, but it is not why I read her stuff) and the stories chosen were not - in my opinion - her best ones.  Wish they would have included more of the classics.  Instead half the book was rather/almost depressing because they include her two-part depression series (which is good - just not light-hearted) and then they also include a two-part series that was incredible boring.  Since there are only 10 stories, that was a substantial amount of the book that lost humor...  Like I said, just wish they had done a couple of other stories.  Ohh well, internet is free to read them on ;)
What a waste of my time.
I dwont ike amozoon
very interesting！！
Did I enjoy this book: Not much.<br/><br/>I know I say this all the time but it’s really hard to write comedy. And humor is so highly subjective that I hesitate to be too critical of this book. I have a strong suspicion that I’m not the target audience for it. Her humor is more likely meant to appeal to a younger audience.<br/><br/>I know that f- - - is the most popular word of the decade. Well, the second most popular word of the decade. It probably comes in just behind twerking. But once you’ve sailed past mile marker 35 or so, the f – bomb fails to detonate. It’s lost its edge. And simply using it doesn’t send a more seasoned reader into giggle fits. So when a joke starts with “For the love of f- - - . . . “, for me it’s just not funny.<br/><br/>There are a lot of cartoons in the book. I don’t think they’re funny either. Cartoons make me want to put it in a children’s category. But then we have that word that begins with an f and ends in an -u-c-k to worry about. And it’s in every couple of paragraphs. It’s even written in cartoon words. So I’m not going to be suggesting it for story time at the local library any time soon.<br/><br/>There is one paragraph where a goose accidentally gets into the live-in couple’s home that made me laugh out loud a few times. I read it at the salon while sitting a chair with some sci-fi looking foil wrapped around my head. It now requires space-aged technology to cover the grey that crowds out the youthful hair that used to reside on my head. And that almost certainly confirms to me that I’m really not the target audience for this comedy.<br/><br/>Would I recommend it: I think this would be a great f- - - ing book to f- - - ing read while you’re f- - - ing twerking. But I can’t think of any other use for it.<br/><br/>Will I read it again: No.<br/><br/>As reviewed by Belinda at Every Free Chance Book Reviews.
If you love Allie Broshs blog, you'll love the book. 'nuff said. Some of the best stories are there, together with the new ones. If you're bothered about some old stories being included: well, you were told that beforehand, so don't complain and don't buy the book if that's not what you want!<br/><br/>The only REAL niggle I have is the format. Hyperbole and a Half is all about COMICS, and the book has a paperback-format! That doesn't do the comics any favour and was honestly not a good idea, the pictures and the text are too small.<br/>It should really be in something like A4.
"Meh."
Loooooove it.
I was a huge fan of the website and was hoping for some great new stuff from the book. It was just  a lot of stuff I already saw on the website and the stuff I hadn't seen was too much about the dogs. I'm not a big dog person so that may have been a bias. But in general I didn't find myself cracking up like I do on the website. It's nice to see the vivid colors on the comics though.<br/><br/>Also shipping was very slow.
Somehow not as engaging and funny as it is on the web. Still funny, there's just something missing. still love her, though.
It went downhill after that. Allie is a good writer, but she needs more life experiences to write about, and less self introspection.
I hate dogs. In every way. But this little book made me laugh so hard about dogs and her experiences with them. It's classic... and confirms to me why I don't have dogs in my life. Dogs side though, this is a funny take into the life of some random stranger. The house thing... hilarious. I can't believe some of this stuff had happened to someone. and at the same time there is stuff we can probably all relate to. It's a shorter book but an enjoyable afternoon read. Or midnight in my case.
Funny and talented Dr sure.  Book is just very short and I didn't get a great value for the $ spent.  Maybe when this goes down in price I would recommend it more.  I do think it's funny, even the artwork totally works.
One great chapter describing her bought with depression (not actually in a humorous way but very uniquely!) but otherwise I didn't get the humor.
This was my first pictorial novel/ autobiography. A very enjoyable funny and sometimes painful truth about many of life's challenges. Relevant to all ages.
Great book
I gave it 2 stars for creativity, but honestly I could not get through any of the pages.  The stories are sophomoric and not funny or entertaining.  Will obtain books from library from here on as the ratings led me to believe this would be somewhat entertaining.
The illustrations were really fun, cute, and probably the best part of the book. There were some humorous situations to read about. If you like people who really are fascinated with their own self you will most probably like this book.
Genius!
I love Allie. Many of us do. I was happy to buy her book, if only to support her. I don't regret buying the book for that reason, but it's a bit disappointing. There's a lot of recycled material, and the new material is darker and more introspective. Nothing that made me laugh out loud like the first time I discovered her blog. She gives a wonderful insight into her depression, which is helpful to show to folks that don't understand depression.
It was great, except for one thing. The cover of the book was the kind which you could just take right off, and it was plain white underneath. I know this isn't a fault on your part, but still.
50% of the book is stories we've all read before. Don't get me wrong, the other 50% had me in tears from laughing, but I didn't pay to have something I'd half read several times before.
This book made me sad.  I didn't finish it because I found myself in a bad mood after each sitting.  Not sure why I expected it to be funny.  It wasn't.
Apparently I'm not the intended audience for this book. I found it to be very dull and uninteresting. The writer's style just didn't click with me.
I was hoping this would be a "book". Instead its the blog in printed form. I still don't feel like I know much about Allie Brosh, it's too much that is not being told about her. Of course, the stories told are wonderful and almost got me thrown of the buss for laughing too loud. Also, I hoped it would take a couple of days for me to finish, but it took me less then 10 hours.
I feel like the jokes and humor get extremely repetitive. I was very disappointed. It just didn't live up to the hype for me.
I was disappointed. There were a few laughs, but it came across more like whining and a bit of self-loathing than humorous.
not living up to the expectations that I had, but cute drawings. That being said, I'm not a graphic novel person.
I bought this for my son's last birthday. It was on his wish list. He tells me it's great. I haven't read it.
i didn't love it but if you are a therapist and into books about depression it is insightful
Really funny, touching, and the drawings are hilarious. Knew it has some profanity in it before I bought it, but wish it did not use the "F" word so many times.
Too depressing to be funny. Not like more of the blog.
I did not find it as amusing as other readers did.
laughed out loud when by myself (and with others also) read it first on my kindle, then ordered the book
not that great. The reviews are wrong.
I think it is kind of depressing .
Hipster cartoons in book form.
but i was unable to really sink my teeth into the book. maybe i will go back to it...i am not sure.
This book is more like a silly teenagers book because of all the silly drawings.  The stories were cute and clever, but the drawings were not for me.
This book should not be available on Kindle. It's impossible to read as the formatting makes the font tiny. Don't buy it on Kindle.
I enjoy Hyperbole and a Half, it's a great and entertaining site; so, I was excited for a book version. However, you should do yourself a favor and save your money. Everything in it, you've read on the site before. Spend an afternoon perusing the site's archives and spend your money on something else.
Author Allie Brosh has an excellent blog by the same name.  She is a talented artist and her posts have historically been either wildly hilarious, or heartbreakingly touching - or both. This book is a compilation of some of her best blog entries, plus some extra material.  It was a pleasure to read, though the content is much funnier and seems to fit better when read online in the blog format.  She posts to her blog infrequently, which is part of the reason it is so popular - she is good at drawing readers in and leaving them hanging on the edge of a cliff!  Especially with her posts about her personal experience with depression.  You just don't get the same experience reading the book.  I am a huge fan and loyal follower of her blog, and would have bought her book in any case, just to support her.  But you COULD save your money and click on [...] instead.
Ok
This book is an exact repeat of her blog.  If you've never read the blog, 5 stars!  If you have read the blog, like me, do NOT buy the book.  Don"t even borrow it from the library.  The "new" content is nearly not funny, and the blog content, while hilarious, is merely like reading the blog again. Re-cycle, re-use, re-peat.  Repetitive.
The book is good and well made, and the stories shes chosen from her blog are fun to reread.  But I was hoping for more original content, that was quirky, weird, and would have me laughing so often any one near me would think I was crazy; but most the new stories lean more toward the sad/depressing end of the spectrum, and often seem forced.<br/><br/>This would be a good book for people who have not read all of Allie Brosh's stuff already, but if you have kept up with her blog and you are stuck choosing between rereading funny stories you could have reread for free or reading depressing stories, the book loses some value in my opinion.<br/><br/>so I gave it 3 stars for consolidating some of the best blog posts in one convenient book, but not really adding any new stories with the unique Allie flair.
I was expecting more original content.  I had read most of it online already.  Though I still love the writing style and illustrations.  The depression stories ring true.
I just didn't get it. This writer is one neurotic person that seems to enjoy being an oddball. No plot to follow. I read it, took it to my coffee group of Red Hatters to pass on and no one would even take it home. Maybe this is a young person's book. It definitely isn't a book for people over 50.
I Had a different endurance suit that was too big so I went a size smaller on this one but it is too small. So the suits are all different. Like most lap swimming suits this runs small at least for a tall person. Very nice suit though!
Weird
Mildly interesting, unique style, unfortunate fascination with "F" word. Not necessary and, for me, distracting. I can't recommend to others.
I think my title summed it up but I love to read Allie's blog and I'm glad to support her book. She had such a unique visual style and her illustrations serve the story so well.<br/><br/>Also get stuff is hilarious. Read this. You'll be glad you did.
Not funny at all. Strange
I can't believe anyone could find this book funny - corny, yes, but funny no! I found it dangerously<br/>close to being unintelligible gobbledygook. I read it on the strength of a glowing review by Bill Gates. As a matter of fact some of his other recommendations were equally as dismal.
I guess this is not my kind of book. I found it irritating, boring & never funny. Maybe I need to work on my sense of humor!
Either I live in the wrong country (Switzerland), or have the wrong education or am too old (67). Obviously, many people have enjoyed this book. Personally, I didn't find it funny, and would not recommend it to people in my age group and/or on this side of the Atlantic.
Why did I buy this book?  is the question I asked myself after struggling to the end of it.  It wasn't funny at all.  In fact, it seemed written by someone who was trying way too hard to be funny and they knew they had run out of material.  If the author was doing a stand up routine somewhere, then the audience would be indiscreetly looking at their watches wishing she would just wrap it up already.  I'm sure someone found it funny, but I didn't.  Sure wasn't amused at losing money on it by buying it.
Unfortunate waste of a tree. I felt like I was reading a book written by a person on drugs since it was all over the place psycho-babble. The birthday party was the only funny story all the rest was incredibly stupid and I could not read the entire book skimmed the rest since it was frustrating and annoying to even get through. I am still befuddled as to why this book is a best seller. Maybe the audience is high when reading it. Waste of time and money but made good fireplace kindle.
I had read much about it, but seriously, I finished this book in 25minutes and it was hugely disappointing. Not sure if I didn't manage to get the nuances, it started out a little funny, but then it quickly catapulted to epic boredom.<br/><br/>Not worth it for the price, and am not a fan of the illustrations either.<br/><br/>Maybe its just me. :( Afterall, its a NYT #1 bestseller.
A large majority of reviewers rate this book highly. I have no idea why. The episodes and comments are utterly mundane and self-absorbed.The drawings are extraordinarily amateurish. For some readers these traits are evidently part of the book's charm. But the whole tone is often depressed, and depressing. Maybe this is intended to convey irony. There are writers who are noted for bringing hilarious humor out of pathos and disaster. Twain, Thurber, Dave Barry, and Andy Borowitz come to mind. But Ms. Brosh's book is not in that category, in my opinion. This is not to disparage her skill as a writer. The problem is that being funny does not seem to be the goal of the book. In fact, I'm not sure what the goal is. The jacket lists this book in the "humor" category, but let the buyer beware.
Moderately funny but not laugh-out- loud funny. I had a hard time reading it without getting bored.  I don't think I would buy anything from this author again.
I bought this book after it popped up on the best-seller list and after reading all the positive reviews. Wow, talk about differences in taste. I think this book is a total waste of time. The cartoon characters aren't even interesting to look at and the writing and dialogue just aren't funny to me. I was unable to finish it. In fact, I'm embarrassed to give it away: I'd hate to waste anyone else's time with it. I think it's just going straight to the trash can.
No, just no. I was looking forward to laughing myself silly with this book based on other reviews, but I just didn't get it. It was terrible.
I am struck by the positive perception of this book. I only read it to the end on a plane because my broken phone did not let me access my other downloaded books. It's the worst book I have ever read - with distinction. It's not funny, not inspiring,  not thrilling. The drawings (hard to decipher in the digital edition) utterly primitive  - but consistent with the stories. I have to admit, though, that her writing is good. Somehow it appears as if the author had successfully completed an online course in better writing style. She has yet to realize that style cannot substitute for substance.<br/><br/>If the stories are fiction, they are ill concocted, make no sense, are poorly connected with each other and have no plot., the author is bare of any enthralling fantasy or imagination. If the stories are a reflection of reality then I pity all those encountering the author, she must have a gift of attracting bad luck to her environment.<br/><br/>On a side note: If her stories are a reflection on the author's real life then she should not be allowed to keep dogs. I have read quite a few books on dogs (and have kept more than a dozen). The weird behaviour of her dogs must be a response to her husbandry and treatment which - at best - is not appropriate for dogs.
I was kind of hoping there'd be more than just what's already in her blog but I'm still glad I bought it
I'm not a fan<br/><br/>I'm not a big dog fan and this book is more than half of her just talking about her dogs .
yas I like it ok more words r required ok um I like the book I read it was good
Definitely not what I was expecting.  If you're very insecure and in counseling for it, this book will reassure you.  I found it sickeningly boring and forced myself to finish it in hopes it would get better.  It never did.  If you're not neurotic, with OCD and various other mental health difficulties, don't waste your time.
The sections about the dogs were quite funny, but the rest read like personal counseling sessions. Very disappointed that I spent money on this.
Waste of 2 hours.  Pitiful stories, people and writing.  I felt sorry for the dogs.  J. Peterman would not have paid a dime for these.
I was looking for a book that I didn't have to think about.  I found it!<br/>A zip through book, with fun illustrations!
I picked up this book by Bill Gates' recommendation. Remind me to never accept book recommendations from billionaires. Kids reading.
I so badly wanted to love this book. I read the chapters on depression and loved them, they were spot on. Unfortunately, I could not get past the author's repeated use of the word "retarded." Surely someone who writes for a living can find less hateful (and more creative) words to use, without denigrating people with differing abilities like my beautiful son. I hope Ms. Brosh gets a thesaurus (and some lessons in political correctness) before writing her next book.
Reading the hyped reviews, I expected more. It was definitely a different take on life, but too narcissistic for my taste.
I was so excited to read this book. After all the hype and rave reviews I was so happy to finally receive a copy from my library. Boy am I glad I didn't pay for this! I am absolutely flabbergasted as to how this book got such a high rating. The stories are mediocre and I was lucky if I breathed out a shallow chuckle while reading. The writing was very amateur and reminded me of mildly entertaining stories told over the dinner table,where the most boring details are embellished and elaborated on to no end to desperately attempt to ignite the story with some semblance of hilarity.<br/><br/>I love comic memoirs but this one just did not hit the mark for me. I did however enjoy the Microsoft paint illustrations and giving each story its own coloured pages gave the book a nice overall aesthetic. Too bad the pretty colours weren't enough to save this.
I wondered when I read the review, but you have to see this book and try to read it<br/>to understand just how much you can not understand and be uncomfortable with a book.
I really wanted to buy and read this book, but the font size is so tiny (smaller than the reviews) and cannot be changed.  I have never encountered this before on my kindle and I have over 300 books on it.
Anyone who's read her website already knows 75% of the stories in this book. They're still hysterically funny - the story about moving with her dogs is reason to buy it - but if you're looking for a ton of new material, this isn't it. I was disappointed.
This is a humor book? This book is simply an absurd amalgam of fleeting thoughts on depression, suicide, lack of impulse control in humans, and the thought patterns of ignorant animals thrown in for good measure.  While I chuckled at least twice during the dog sections, the rest was a very tedious read.  Not recommended unless you want to spend the afternoon like I did combing through a bunch of random thoughts about depression and impulse control in a non-thought provoking and rather unfunny read.  If you are going to read it, hit up the library like I did.  Don't spend any money on it or you will likely regret it.
the book itself was physically assembled out of order and with dozens of missing pages while other pages were duplicated.  it is a mess.  looks like a first grader tried to piece pages together.  it is difficult to review a book that is missing two chapters, but of the ones I was able to read...  I would say about half of it was entertaining, while the other half was a self-absorbed account of the author's long period of depression -- not what I would call humorous content.  I bought this because I like some internet posts from the author, but apparently I was only missing a couple more good posts while the others were more depressing than entertaining.
I bought the book for my 7 years old daughter, but I didn't know the content has bad words in it.
I read other reviews and wonder if I am even reading the same book. It was no where near as funny/witty/entertaining as I had hoped. There are many of her doodles, but too many pages are just a doodle and a few brief sentences.
I ordered this book thinking it would be a nice Christmas Present for my daughter's boy friend. The language was not at all acceptable to me so I did not give it to anyone. Four letter words seem to be a  lack of vocabulary in expressing ones self.
Big disappointment
A first-world problem book, built around anecdotal stories of a person who clearly couldn't develop into personality.
A neat way to tell a biography but please leave the f word out of every other sentence.  I won't read it.
This book ranks very close to one of the most useless books ever. The pictures are an over abundance  (to take up space maybe(?)) and the incredibly blasé she writes about very real and very difficult problems that a lot of people do suffer from (yes, I'm a medical professional) and struggle with every day of their lives is highly offensive and somewhat degrading (and yes, I realize this was pointed out, however briefly, the statement did not make it exactly clear that depression/anxiety is something to be made fun of? Complete with offensive pictures!!) I do consider myself to be very open minded about most everything. This book, however, needs to be returned to its rightful place. The trash!
I was not aware of some of the language. It was offensive to me and feel there should be a warning in the description.
Excessive use of the F-word.  I'm sending this back.
I really really wanted to love this book because I absolutely LOVE her blog.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed to see that at least 1/2 of the stories from the book are also from the blog (and thus, I had already read them).  I'll keep the book because I want to support this artist, but I probably wouldn't have bought the book new if I knew how much of the material I had already read.
This was a new one for me - vulgar language on the dedication page. Then I open to the first page and another zinger greets my eye. I'm really tired of how low brow our society is becoming. Clean it up, Ms. Brosh. You'll find you can be even funnier when you're not using vulgar language.
I have been following the blog Hyperbole and a Half for years now and genuinely enjoyed the blog, even enough to reread older posts. I was extremely excited to read this book but honestly it just fell flat. A lot of the comics were repeats, which I expected some, but not as many as were littered throughout the book. I didn't crack a smile once at her newer comics and her humor is really my sense of style.<br/><br/>I was not entertained in the least and getting through the book felt like a chore. I regret my purchase and actually bought about ten copies to put in holiday baskets for my friends. I will be returning those copies, I don't feel like this book is up to their standards.
I, like the other one star reviewers, fell into buying this book due to the high ratings. I could not even tell you what chapter I left off with. I did not find anything funny at all about this book. It just appears (as one review put it) that a whiny child is writing it. The drawings are distracting and overwhelmingly childish. If you read this review please take my advice and DO NOT buy this. What a waste of money.....
Insulting to adult intelligence. Meant for whom?
Dumbest book EVER!!! And for the record, I LOVE dogs and I have a sense of humor!!!
I first read a review of this book on the New York Times, which was included as a recommendation on their Christmas gift list. I have known people who suffered from depression, personally experiencing it at times, and am empathetic. Since I tend to have a distorted sense of humor, I thought this book might be perfect both for me as well as a gift for a friend. Oh, my! I read through a few pages when I received the books but had to scramble to find another gift for my friend. No way would she have liked this book and I would have been extremely embarrassed to pass it along to her, or even my most disliked acquaintance. I can add nothing new to the others' negative reviews except to confirm: this is one terrible book, extremely over-hyped! Please read it yourself or at least look it over carefully before buying! It is not well written. Not funny. The 4 letter words come early and often and though I, myself, curse occasionally, this constant stream was more than distracting. It seems the author has no intelligent way of truly grappling with her innermost feelings, except to wail at the level of grunting. I'm happy for her that she got things off her chest. Better to keep a personal diary!<br/><br/>Perhaps it's a generational thing - I am in my 50s and this over-sharing occurs with those in their 20s and 30s. Please, spare the rest of us from TMI and learn that dignity and thoughtfulness will offer more healing than whining and complaining with utterances expected from a 5 year old!
full of cartoons.  I wanted a book to read
Stupid, waste of paper. I have read funnier Cheez-it box back sides, apologies author. The art was upsetting, the stories not interesting, and do not believe reviews.
Worst book I've ever read. Can't even.
I wasn't sure about buying this book as a gift but was swayed by the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  It ended up being the one book I gave that didn't elicit much interest.  Having flipped through it since, I can see why.  If there are any redeeming qualities in it, they were lost on me.  It's a microcosm of some of the worst aspects of 21st century first-world culture.  A self-involved, narcissistic, wordy, and ultimately pointless mish-mash of stories accompanied by intentionally crude MS Paint drawings.  Some people aren't that interesting.  Those people probably shouldn't be published memoirists.<br/><br/>Imagine being cornered at a party by someone who proceeds to take ten minutes of your life to tell you about how when they were a kid they ate hot sauce a lot because their parents thought they liked hot sauce a lot, even though it turns out they didn't really like hot sauce that much.  Then imagine this person somehow wastes two more hours of your existence telling you even more pointless stories about such riveting topics as their kooky dogs.  And then asks you for $12 for their troubles.  That's essentially what this book is.<br/><br/>I tried to return it to Amazon after the holidays, but it turned out they were willing to refund the cost of the book without me even returning it.  The fact that even Amazon doesn't want this book was more humorous than anything found inside its pages.
I was looking forward to reading a book on hyperbole, a big presense in today's society, but this isn't what I wanted.  Also disliked the illustrations.  mag
Hate a strong word but I have to give this the worst rating available.  The concept of writing back to yourself (as an adult writing back to letters you wrote when you were a child) was unique, however, the foul language used in this book was a total turn off for me.  I kept reading hoping it was an isolated incident but the words just kept coming.  I'm sorry I bought the book.  It was a waste of money.  I learned I need to do a little more research before I buy a book for my kindle.  I would not recommend the book to anyone.
This is drivel.  I have no idea why the others rated this so high unless they are related to the author.
This book was unfortunately chosen during my last book club get-together.  I got through the first couple pages and found myself wondering why I cared about what the rambling author had to say.  The topics she did talk about were boring and poorly illustrated.  Yuck!
Terrible, a complete waste of $ & time. Amazon should not sell things this bad. Don't waste your money on this.
I did not like this book at all and can't understand why it is getting such great reviews.  It was a waste of money.  It's a comic book for goodness sake!!
It might be a wonderful book to read but I can't get past the use of the word "f..." in the first few pages. Sadly, our culture continues to be debased by the printing of books  by authors who believe they need to use vulgar language. You do not need to use vulgar language to make a point unless you have no point to make at all which appears to be this author's modus operandi.
This author seems to believe that innappropriate, smutty or banal words are hillariously funny, for from the beginning he uses them to describe almost every thought, incident or indecent moment of his life.  That other people don't find it hillarious is beyond his capability to comprehend.  I had only gotten through page one before a feeling of utter disgust filled my mind, but as I gave it a few more chances to find something minimally humorous, I came to the conclusion that was a hopeless quest.  Perhaps it was written by a pre-pubescent teen who hasn't studied the art of good conversation.  I am sorry I bought it, for I found nothing funny.<br/><br/>I must give the caveat that I have occasionally used a few of those words in context of a difficult situation (like dropping the Thanksgiving turkey on my toe), so be assured - I am not a prude.  Yet, as this author uses these words, I must make a concerted effort to eradicate my use of them in any situation, for they have nothing to offer to a civilized world.
The worse book I have ever read. And I do this knowing she suffers from depression. Sorry. Stick to blogging
